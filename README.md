# Literary Analysis of Short fiction

This project attempts to identify some elements of a typical story, namely:

Point of view: The term point of view refers to who is telling a story, or who is narrating it. The narration of a story or novel can be told in three main ways: first person, second person, and third person.

Protagonist: A protagonist is the principal character of a literary work.

Theme: Theme is defined as a main idea or an underlying meaning of a literary work, which may be stated directly or indirectly.

Style: Style in literature is the literary element that describes the ways that the author uses words â€” the author's word choice, sentence structure, figurative language, and sentence arrangement all work together to establish mood, images, and meaning in the text.

The dataset is comprised of 118 New Yorker short fiction stories scraped from: https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/fiction. A human readable form of the dataset can be found in the file whole_dataset.csv.
