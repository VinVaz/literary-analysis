An Inch And a Half of Glory	<p>Out <span data-page="page_1"></span>of the open doorway and an open second-story window thin curls of smoke came without propulsion to fade in the air. Above, a child’s face—a young face held over the sill with a suggestion of standing tiptoe—was flat against the glass of a window on the third floor. The face held puzzlement without fear. The man on Earl Parish’s left saw it first.</p><p>“Look!” he exclaimed, pointing. “There’s a kid up there!”</p><p>The others tilted their faces and repeated, “There’s a kid up there.”</p><p>“Did anybody turn in the alarm yet?” a man who had just arrived asked.</p><p>“Yes,” several voices assured him, one adding, “The engines ought to be here any minute now.”</p><p>“He’s all right, that kid,” the man who had first seen the child praised his discovery. “Ain’t crying or nothing.”</p><p>“Most likely he don’t even know what’s going on.”</p><p>“The firemen will be here in a second. Ain’t much use of us trying to do anything. They can get him out with their hook ’n’ ladders quicker than we could.”</p><p>Feet shuffled on the sidewalk and gazes left the upper window to fasten on the smoking doorway. No one answered the man who had spoken last. After a moment, his face reddened. Earl Parish found his own cheeks warm. Looking out of the corners of his eyes at the faces around him, he saw more color than before. His glance met another man’s. Both looked quickly across the street again.</p><p>A woman’s voice came from a house behind the men.</p><p>“Somebody ought to get that child out of there! Even if it ain’t burnt up, it’s liable to get scared into convulsions or something.”</p><p>Earl Parish tried to take his gaze away from the upstairs window, and failed. It was terrible, and it held him: a stupid flat face into which panic must come each instant—and did not. If the child had cried and beat the pane with its hands there would have been pain in looking at it, but not horror. A frightened child is a definite thing. The face at the window held its blankness over the men in the street like a poised club, racking them with the threat of a blow that did not fall.</p><p>Earl Parish wet his lips and thought of words he did not say. The child was not in real danger. No great heat was behind the smoke that came from the house. To leave these men and bring the child down from its window would seem a flaunting of inexpensive courage. To suggest a rescue—if he could have explained his wish to save the child from consciousness of danger, rather than from danger itself, he would have spoken. But he distrusted his ability to make the distinction clear.</p><p>“The engines ought to be here any minute now,” the man who had made that prediction twice before was repeating. He scowled up and down the red brick street. “Where in the hell are them engines?” he demanded.</p><p>The man who had discovered the face at the window cleared his throat, his eyes focussed somewhat rigidly on the window.</p><p>“Maybe she’s right,” he said. “The kid’s liable to be scared into fits. I had a nephew that got scared into St. Vitus’s dance just by having a cat jump up on him.”</p><p>“Is that so?” the Fire Department’s herald asked with extraordinary interest.</p><p>“Maybe we better—” Earl Parish suggested.</p><p>“Maybe we better.”</p><p>The group swayed indecisively. Then eight men crossed the street, their pace quickening as they approached the smoking doorway. Going up the four wooden steps they jostled one another, each trying to get ahead of the others. All were going into the house: such risk as attended them would be shared. But he who went first would bring the child down: the others would constitute a not especially important chorus.</p><p>Inside the door, a gust of smoke blew on them, shutting out the light, scorching eyes and throats. Gongs and sirens clamored in the street.</p><p>“There’s the engines now!” their prophet cried. “They’ll have the kid down in no time!”</p><p>Out of sight, the suspended blow in the child’s face was without power. Seven men went back into the street with nothing apologetic in the manner of their going. Earl Parish remained in the house.</p><p>Through the smoke that clouded but did not fill the hallway, brass lines gleamed on a flight of steps. He hesitated. He wanted to climb those steps and either bring the child down or stay with it until the fire had been extinguished. But to do so seemed a breach of faith with the men who had gone back to the street. Had he told them he was going through with the venture, they would have accompanied him. Having stayed silently behind, if he came out now with the child, or was found upstairs with it when the fire had been put out, they would think he had tricked them so he might pose as one who had gone alone through something that had daunted them.</p><p>He took a step toward the street, and stopped. To go out without the child now would be no better. The men in the street, who no doubt had missed him by this time, would think he had lost courage after breaking faith with them.</p><p>Earl Parish went up the brass-striped steps. The smoke<span data-page="page_2"></span> thickened as he mounted, but was never dense enough to make advance difficult. He saw no flames. On the third floor a rickety door barred him from the front of the building until he remembered that this was an unusual occasion, an emergency, strictly speaking. He thrust the door in with his shoulder.</p><p>He found little smoke in the room with the child, though a thin fog came in with him. The child came to him.</p><p>“Moke,” it pronounced gravely.</p><p>“You’re all right now, sonny,” Earl Parish said, picking the child up. “I’ll have you out of here in a jiffy.”</p><p>He draped a red-and-green cloth from the table lightly about its head, leaving a corner loose for his own possible use. He took pains not to show himself at the window, and went down the way he had come up.</p><p>In the street again, someone took the child. He was faintly giddy from the smoke, the effort of groping his way down with the child, and the excitement that had grown in him as he descended—the nervousness that is inseparable from even the most orderly of retreats. He stood very erect, avoiding curious stares. The eyes of the seven men who had crossed the street with him reproached him from twenty paces.</p><p>He walked away, down the street with a stiff affectation of nonchalance: a short, sturdy man of thirty or so in a well-pressed double-breasted coat that made him as rectangular as a shoebox standing on end.</p><p>At his desk the next morning Earl Parish searched the day’s papers. In the <em>Morning Post</em>, he found an inch and a half of simple news that a fire of unknown origin had been subdued with slight damage after a child was carried to safety by Earl Parish. He folded the account into the center of the newspaper and put it out of sight.</p><p>Between the departure of No. 131, southbound, and the arrival of No. 22, a train announcer came to Earl Parish’s window and grinned at him over the sign that said “Information.”</p><p>“Where’s the medal?” the train announcer asked.</p><p>Earl Parish grinned foolishly back, blood came into his face, he perspired.</p><p>The news went around the station: Earl Parish had rescued a child from a blazing building—two children. The station employees with whom he was intimate joked about his deed. The more important employees—baggage master, stationmaster, chief dispatcher—congratulated him solemnly, as if on behalf of the company. At noon, the general passenger agent himself, on his way to a convention in St. Louis, stopped to commend Earl Parish’s bravery. Earl Parish listened to his words, answered his questions, kept his gaze fixed on the general passenger agent’s watch chain, and perspired. The general passenger agent’s train was finally announced. He shook Earl Parish’s hand and went away.</p><p>Earl Parish did his day’s work in an emotional muddle, avoiding eyes, mopping his moist face incessantly with his handkerchief. Looking up to find the most casual glance turned in his direction, he would feel his face go crimson, and a desire to drop on his knees out of sight below the window would come to him. Between the necessary contacts with fellow-employees and inquiring travellers, he pretended business with guidebooks and folders in the rear of his cubbyhole, and there was exaltation in him. That night, he lay for a long while across his bed, studying the printed inch and a half he had cut from the <em>Morning Post</em>. There had been nothing heroic—except perhaps in a negative way—about his going into the smoking building: he had brought the child down not as one would snatch it from peril but as one would protect it from awareness of peril. Nevertheless, it was pleasant to lie across his bed knowing that people throughout the city had read of what he had done, that his acquaintances thought of him as a man of courage and perhaps were mildly boasting that they knew this Earl Parish.</p><p>Lying across the bed, he found these things pleasant. To listen to praise, even if thickly overlaid with banter, was not pleasant. It was embarrassing to be studied by eyes that tried to estimate the familiar Earl Parish in terms of the new development. But that was his self-consciousness, his shyness, and would pass. It was a transient annoyance. The joy that had come to him out of this affair would not wear away: that was a fixed thing in him.</p><p>He went rosy-faced to work the next morning, creeping out of the house to avoid his suddenly too tender landlady. The day was less uncomfortable than the previous one. To the same extent that he was becoming accustomed to his new position among his fellows, he was drifting back to last week’s position. The ticket sellers, opposite his window, still threw jests through their grilles: “The next time you save any women and children, save me a blonde!” But now he could smile back at them without perspiring.</p><p>Occasionally he met acquaintances who had seen the <em>Post</em> story and spoke of it. He blushed and was uncomfortable at these times, but he enjoyed the later thoughts of them. He never went into the street without a wish for one of these meetings. The next issue of the railroad company’s <em>Employees</em>’ <em>Magazine</em> contained his photograph and an elaborated account of his feat.</p><p>Then the fire<span data-page="page_3"></span> was as if it had never happened.</p><p>No one ever mentioned it. He brought it casually into his talk once or twice, but no one showed any interest. At first, he thought this coldness sprang from boredom. Later, he decided envy was truly responsible.</p><p>He began to keep to himself. After all, what had he in common with the people around him? An uninteresting lot: the lesser inhabitants of the world, unimportant cogs in not especially important machines. He himself was a cog, true enough, but with the difference that on occasion he could be an identity. The last drop of ancestral venturesomeness had not been distilled from his blood. He experimented with this thought, evolving a sentence he liked: “All their ancestral courage has been distilled by industrialism out of their veins.” He would look at the world over his sign that said “Information” and repeat the sentence to himself.</p><p>People who passed his window or brought their questions to it were sorted. Did they retain some part of their ancestral courage? Or did they not? The first class was small.</p><p>Complaints went uptown to the general offices: the man at the information window had been unobliging, had been rude, had been insulting. Earl Parish received a formal letter, calling his attention to a number of these complaints and to the purple slogan on the company’s advertising matter: Courtesy All-Ways. Such important departments as the information bureau, the letter insisted, had great influence on the public’s attitude toward the company, and on that attitude depended not only the railroad’s income but also its success in securing favorable legislation.</p><p>Earl Parish did not like this letter. With a pencil and a pad of paper he began framing a reply, not such a reply as might be expected of a cog. A testy old man came to his window with an unanswerable question. The Earl Parish of a while ago would have led the old man around to a point where the answer to an altogether different question would have satisfied him. The Earl Parish who was busy with the draft of his reply to the general offices told the old man point-blank that his question was silly. The testy old man was a personage of some sort. The next day Earl Parish was given two weeks’ notice. He left within ten minutes.</p><p>Ten days later, he found a place in a steamship agency. A month later, he was looking for work again. He had sat dreaming over his desk one afternoon and his employer, a little fat man with a fat sneering mouth, had asked him if he was afraid of work. Had asked him—a little fat man who would have buried his face in his arms at the first sign of danger. He had told the little fat man exactly what he was afraid of and exactly what not, and in the end had found himself walking down the street with his wages in his pocket.</p><p>His next position was in the basement of a wholesale-drug house, but he quit this place after two weeks. He was done with working at a desk. He had reasoned things out. Desk jobs were well enough for a man who could not rise above them. But nowadays there was a scarcity of—hence must be a demand for—men whose ancestral courage had not been distilled out of their veins. He meant to find and fill such an opening.</p><p>Three months of searching exhausted his savings and persuaded him he had been mistaken. It seemed there was no place for venturesomeness in the modern world. Courage was the one thing for which business had no use—not only could not use it but did not want to have it around. If your employer learned you were not a sheep or a worm—a timid, docile sheep or worm—he immediately got rid of you.</p><p>Earl Parish was working temporarily in a soap factory when he read one day in a newspaper that the city Fire Department was dangerously undermanned. He deserted the soap factory at once, amazed that he had needed the newspaper to point out his path: the city Fire Department was so obviously the one place in the world for him!</p><p>He submitted his application and a doctor surveyed his body. Days passed, and he was told he had failed the physical examination—a matter of defective kidneys. In the office of a fire commissioner that same afternoon, Earl Parish created a diversion. An inch and a half of cut newspaper was brandished before the commissioner’s eyes. The commissioner was called an old fool. Presently Earl Parish was hustled to the sidewalk.</p><p>He went then to the offices of the <em>Morning Post</em>, where he found someone to listen to his story. The <em>Post</em> happened to be an opposition paper at the time. It gave half a column to the tale of the man who once had “dashed into a blazing building to rescue a little child,” and who now, unable to find other employment, was barred from the Fire Department by “the same red tape which is responsible for the department’s inability to get and keep an adequate force.”</p><p>Out of this advertisement Earl Parish got—besides a new clipping—employment as night watchman in a packing plant. He was paid four dollars a night and soon learned that two men who had divided<span data-page="page_4"></span> the work had been discharged to make a place for him. It was the watchman’s duty to make a tour of the building once an hour, registering at fifteen little boxes hung on the walls. After the first week, Earl Parish began to skip boxes, those in distant corners. There were complaints, of course, but he ignored them. He had been hired, he reasoned, because of his known courage, and he trusted that to overbalance minor irregularities. He was mistaken. He was discharged at the end of the third week.</p><p>Returning to the <em>Post</em>, he could find no one to listen to his story. The other papers were as indifferent. He found several positions within the next few months. Sometimes he resigned, sometimes he was discharged. He earned enough to pay for meals and a place to sleep. He spent much time in a public square just out of the business district. Sitting on a bench, or sprawling on the grass, he would sort passersby according to his habit. Fewer and fewer were those whose ancestral courage had not been distilled by industrialism out of their veins. Now and then, he would write a letter to the <em>Post’s</em> Open Forum, commenting bitterly on this failing of the race.</p><p>Sometimes he would go down to the waterfront, pretending he was going to make his way to some virile land where the courageous still prospered and sheep were eaten. He never put his foot on a deck, never asked a question that could lead to a place aboard a boat. The periods of halfhearted search for work grew longer. The intervals of employment shrank. Some days, he was hungry.</p><p>One of these days, he went to the house from which he had carried the child. The child’s family had moved from the neighborhood to nobody knew where. Another morning when hunger was a hard lump in his stomach he walked the streets, studying the faces of the people he passed, classifying them, but not in his familiar fashion. He sought now to pick out the probably liberal from the probably not liberal.</p><p>Three times, he approached faces that bespoke generosity. Three times, last-minute timidity and the too near presence of others in the street kept him silent, sent him hurrying on as if a pressing engagement awaited him at the end of the street. The fourth face that attracted him was very old, and years had washed it clean of all color, of all expression save a meek friendliness. Its owner walked alone and slowly, with the help of a silver-knobbed cane. His shoes were black mirrors.</p><p>Earl Parish turned around and followed the old man. Other pedestrians passed and repassed them. Earl Parish kept half a block behind his man, and as he walked he took his three finger-worn clippings out of their envelope and put them loose in his pocket, where they would be readily available if his request for “a dime or so” needed documentary bolstering.</p><p>Presently the old man turned in to a street where people were few. Earl Parish quickened his pace and the distance between them shrank. Hurrying thus, he came to a corner where a bare-headed man was breaking the glass front of a fire-alarm box with a fist wrapped in a handkerchief.</p><p>Earl Parish forgot his kindly faced quarry.</p><p>“Where is it?” he asked the bare-headed man in a curt professional tone.</p><p>“Around in the back street.”</p><p>Earl Parish ran around the corner. Three men were converging on the opening of a narrow street that split the block. He hurried after them. From a red-and-white house in the middle of the block spongy smoke rolled out to the gray street.</p><p>In front of the house, a man tried to grab Earl Parish’s arm. He struck aside the interfering hand and sprang up the front steps.</p><p>“Hey! Come out o’ there, you!” the man called after him.</p><p>Earl Parish pushed open the front door and plunged into the murky interior. A blow to his chest stopped him, jarred him back on his heels, emptied his lungs of the clean air they had carried in from the street. Smoke stung his throat, chest. His hands found the thing that had struck him—a newel. He clung to it while he closed his eyes against the scorching smoke and coughed.</p><p>A foot found the bottom of a flight of steps. He went up, one hand fumbling along the railing, the other clenched over nose and mouth. The platform of an interfloor landing came under his feet. His hand on the rail guided him around the turning in the stairs. He started to climb again.</p><p>A boiling hiss, the beat of hotness on his face jerked his eyes open. In front of him nimble red blades of fire poked up at the ceiling.</p><p>Earl Parish cried out—a smoke-garbled protest against this trickery, this betrayal. In that other house had been no visible fire. Nothing had been there but smoke, and a child to be carried out. Here was live flame and—he was a fool!—perhaps nobody to be carried out. How did he know anyone was upstairs? Was it likely?</p><p>A limber bright sword bent down at him. He turned and scurried down the stairs. The landing tripped him with its break in the step-after-step descent, tumbled him down on hands and knees. Red light sizzled down the rail after<span data-page="page_final"></span> him. Its flare was mauve on a small piece of paper that lay close under his nose as he huddled there.</p><p>He stared at the paper with curious intentness. It was somehow familiar, this small rectangle of soiled wood pulp, so altogether unimportant, so trivial a thing here in a burning house. And when he recognized the paper he continued to stare, seeing now for the first time in its true size his cherished clipping from last year’s <em>Post:</em> an inch and a half of simple news that a fire of unknown origin had been subdued with slight damage after a child had been carried to safety by Earl Parish.</p><p>Seeing the clipping truly, he saw its significance and he saw other things: he saw himself with a clearness that mottled his face beyond power of smoke and fire. He stood up on the landing and faced upstairs with the bit of paper crumpled in his fist.</p><p>“I had my fun, you—” he personified the clipping in a compound invective and flung the clipping to the fire. “Now I’m going to earn it!”</p><p>Smoke swirled in the stairs, red light sizzled, and living flame blades poked up at the ceiling. Earl Parish went through them to the second floor. Not all of him went through. Some hair, a patch of one hand’s skin, and parts of his clothing that were frayed into ready kindling disappeared. The rest of Earl Parish gained the second story, slammed a door between him and the stairs, and beat out the points of light that dotted his clothes.</p><p>On the other side of the door fire seethed and crackled. He laughed at the noise as well as he could with smoke strangling him, and began to explore the fumid gloom.</p><p>He found no one in the room with him, nor in the other rooms that made up the house’s top story. He swayed as he walked back to the first room. His head was hollow and buoyant, and he breathed in choking gulps. He staggered toward the front window.</p><p>A small sneeze came out of a corner.</p><p>Earl Parish dropped down on hands and knees and peered under the chair there. A cinnamon kitten stopped rubbing paws on nose to sneeze again. Earl Parish laughed hoarsely as he scooped the kitten out of its retreat and stuffed it into a coat pocket.</p><p>He had trouble getting himself erect again, but managed it fully. The window slid up easily, to create a draft that swung open the room’s door and swept in flame bulky out of all semblance to sword blades.</p><p>Earl Parish clambered up on the windowsill and looked into the upturned faces down in the street.</p><p>A policeman waved an arm.</p><p>“Stick it out, brother,” he called. “Here’s the wagons now!”</p><p>“Look out!” Earl Parish yelled back, and jumped.</p><p>There was a shock, but not of the expected hard pavement. He was on a sort of blue cushion: the policeman had run to stand under him. Men dragged them out of the arriving firemen’s way, helped them to their feet. The policeman’s face was bleeding.</p><p>“You’re a lunatic!” he said.</p><p>Earl Parish was busy with his coat pocket, disentangling the cinnamon kitten from the torn lining. Someone took the kitten. Voices said things, asked things. One of the questions had to do with Earl Parish’s name and address.</p><p>“Earl—” He coughed violently to cover up the halt, and repeated, “Earl—John W. Earl,” and gave a street and number, hoping they didn’t belong to any of the people around him.</p><p>He was insisting that he was all right, that he didn’t need medical attention. He was sneaking through the crowd. He was hurrying away from the fire, down an alley. He turned three corners before he stopped. Out of his pocket he took two clippings—one from a railroad employees’ magazine, the other from a newspaper.</p><p>He tore them into very small bits and tossed them up in a flurry of artificial snow.</p><p>In Howard Street, sandwiched between a secondhand-clothing store and a lunch counter, there is an establishment whose large front room is bare and unfurnished except for a shabby desk, a chair, a table behind a battered counter in the rear, and a blackboard that occupies one sidewall. You will find listed in chalk on this board such items as “Laborers, company, country, $3.75; Wood Choppers, 4 ft. and stove wood, $2.50-4.50 cord; Choremen, country, $45-65, fd.; Lead Burner, company, $8.” Beneath some of these items “Fare paid” will appear.</p><p>Into this establishment one afternoon came a short, sturdy man of thirty or so, inordinately dirty-faced and shabby. He had no hat, and some of his hair seemed to have been eaten off. A smudge was where one eyebrow should have been. He walked unsteadily. His red eyes had the inward hilarity of a drunken philosopher. But he did not smell of alcohol—rather, of fresh wood smoke. He leaned over the battered counter and grinned jovially at the establishment’s proprietor.</p><p>“I want,” he said, “a job. Any kind of job you’ve got, if only it’ll get me away from town before the morning papers come out.” ♦</p>	Dashiell Hammett	June 10 & 17, 2013 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/06/10/an-inch-and-a-half-of-glory	Books	Children	Fame	Firemen	Fires	Heroes	Earl Parish 	Third	Children
Aphrodisiac	<p>Kishen’s <span data-page="page_1"></span>university friends at Cambridge completely understood when he talked to them about the sort of novel that should be written about India—the sort of novel that he wanted to write. The thing was, he explained, to get the integers right, to be sure that these were sunk into the deepest layers of the Indian experience: caste-ridden villagers, urban slum dwellers, landless laborers, as well as the indecently rich of commerce and industry.</p><p>His own integers were sunk in a prosperous gated colony in New Delhi. Here he returned from Cambridge to live with his mother and his elder brother, Shiv, in the villa that his late father had commissioned in the International Style, which was prevalent at the time. During Kishen’s absence, Shiv had got married—in a big, traditional wedding, which Kishen couldn’t attend because he was in the middle of his finals. So he didn’t meet his new sister-in-law until his return. He hadn’t meant to stay in India. He’d wanted to go back to Cambridge and maybe study for another degree until he felt himself ready to start on his life’s work. But then this happened, <em>she</em> happened: his sister-in-law, Naina.</p><p>It hadn’t been an arranged marriage; Kishen’s mother was too modern to arrange marriages for her sons. A respected economist, she had always been at the forefront of educated Indian women. Sometimes she and her elder son even served on the same committees, for Shiv was a high-ranking bureaucrat. He had met his bride at a reception in honor of her uncle, a member of parliament, who had brought Naina from her father’s estate in their native province for her first visit to New Delhi. She was very young, shy, scarcely educated, though she had attended an élite girls’ boarding school in Jaipur. After her marriage, her mother-in-law tried to encourage her to study at some New Delhi college, but Naina claimed to be too stupid—yes, even for domestic science.</p><p>Although Kishen couldn’t help agreeing that she was, to some extent, stupid, she was the only person in the house with whom he was eager to discuss his projected novel. She took no interest in it at all, yet somehow she casually disposed of one of his greatest problems: how to communicate the nuances of Indian life in English, which was the only language in which he could truly express himself. Naina simply jumbled up her languages, English and Hindi. When he tried to talk to her about his work (because he wanted to talk to her about everything), she didn’t even pretend to listen. Instead, she said, “I’m meeting the girls—coffee <em>pina hai. Aoge</em>? <em>Chalo bhai</em> we’ll have some fun—<em>mazza ajaiga</em>.”</p><p>She had formed her own circle of girlfriends, and Kishen soon became a source of entertainment for them. Naina was proud of the way he amused them and humored all their concerns. They valued his opinion in matters of style, and also of culture, though he laughed at their taste, which hadn’t changed since they were schoolgirls. They held morning coffee parties in the smartest Connaught Place restaurants or watched pirated films together on the giant screens in their giant living rooms. When they cried at a heroine’s onscreen plight, Kishen would murmur some remark into Naina’s ear, converting her tears into giggles, which soon spread to all the weeping girls.</p><p>They liked attending polo matches and pretending to be in love with the contestants, who were princelings from the President’s Bodyguard. These young women were all married, but mostly to rich, paunchy businessmen who in no way resembled the polo players. Only Shiv was tall and handsome (the opposite of Kishen), and Naina’s friends sincerely appreciated her good luck. So did she, though she was, or pretended to be, critical of Shiv: of his absorption in his work, which didn’t leave enough time for her; of his lack of interest in the romantic films and books she adored. She often laughed about him—she imitated his walk, the way his feet splayed outward, so busy, so important—and Kishen laughed with her. If his mother overheard them, she rebuked them but couldn’t help smiling with pride in her elder son, which she knew Naina, for all her mockery, shared. Only Kishen’s laughter was genuine.</p><p>Mother and Shiv, both busy with their work, were glad that Kishen and Naina were such good company for each other. But sometimes Mother would ask, “And your work?” For she was waiting for Kishen to become as successful in his field as Shiv was in his. “Coming along,” Kishen answered, and he considered this to be true. He felt that, with Naina and her friends, he was immersing himself in his material. <em>They</em> were the integers with which he would build his world—the India that he knew, not what others thought he should know. The girls, too, were waiting for him to become published and famous. When they asked what he was writing about, he said, “You.” That made them laugh, and they clamored for a percentage of the fortune he was going to make with their lives.</p><p>Meanwhile, he entertained them with stories, anecdotes from their New Delhi social world—hungry kites swooping over an open-air banquet, new, palatial apartment buildings without electricity or water, the Ayurvedic doctor poking his tented patients through their burkas, the dire results of a homeopath mixing up his aphrodisiacs with his laxatives. “You<span data-page="page_2"></span> should write it down!” the girls exclaimed—and, at their urging, he began to do so. They snatched the pages from him and sent them to the editor of a leading English-language newspaper, who was a friend of all the girls and the lover of one. These writings—these tongue-in-cheek anecdotes—became the basis of his local fame. A magazine commissioned a weekly column; he was read everywhere. Mother returned from her meetings reporting the chuckles of her fellow committee members; Shiv quoted a cabinet minister who said that Kishen “had hit the nail right on the head.” Everyone was proud of him.</p><p>That was during his first two years back in India. Then things began to change in the house. Actually, physically, they had begun to change soon after Naina’s arrival. Mother had originally furnished the house with the newfound enthusiasm of the intellectual classes for indigenous Indian handicrafts—vibrant textiles from Orissa, village women’s silver anklets turned into ashtrays. Now another layer was added, for whenever Naina went home to see her family—which she did often in those first years—she brought back precious objects of her own. These were not village handicrafts but something differently indigenous: the gaudy taste of the maharajas’ palaces, which had drifted down to her own family of feudal landowners. She installed multicolored chandeliers, oil paintings of hunting parties and court ceremonials. Mother’s bright hand-loomed rug was replaced by the pelt of a recently killed tiger. Naina was so proud of these acquisitions that Mother even allowed the head of a water buffalo to be nailed to the wall, though it had to be taken down when, having been improperly embalmed, it began to decay and disintegrate.</p><p>Then came Naina’s first pregnancy, for which, in accordance with custom, she went home. When she reappeared, it was not only with a baby but with his nurse. This nurse, known as Bari-Mai, had been Naina’s mother’s and Naina’s and was now very old. She spoke in a dialect that only Naina could understand, and she made it clear that no one in the house was of any importance to her except Naina, whom she called Devi (goddess), and the baby, Munna. But with Kishen Bari-Mai did establish a peculiar relationship. From the first moment she saw him, she wheezed so much that she could only point at him in derision—but for what? Naina said, “It’s because she’s never seen anyone like you.”</p><p>“You mean, anyone so ugly?”</p><p>“<em>Aré,</em> gosh, darling, <em>yeh kya baat hai</em>? What are you saying?” She stroked his cheek, and, although he liked this affectionate gesture, it made him aware that he was short, squat, and balding: ugly, no doubt, to both her and Bari-Mai.</p><p>“<em>Dekho</em>, <em>Baba</em>—<em>Papa hai!</em>” Naina called out when Shiv came home from the office, and she thrust the bundled baby into his arms. Shiv held him nervously. No one in the family felt comfortable holding the baby. There was something disconcerting to them in the many little amulets he wore around his neck and wrists, each guarding him against a disease or the Evil Eye. He was also greasy from the oil that Bari-Mai smeared on him for the health of his skin and hair. And he had a peculiar smell, which was not that of a baby but more—though no one said it—that of Bari-Mai. For not only did she clutch him all day but she slept with him at night, on the floor of the nursery that Mother had furnished for him with a new white cot, a playpen, and a mural of Mother Goose rhymes.</p><p>After Munna’s birth, Naina abandoned the outings with her girlfriends, and Kishen stayed home with her. She was very free in his presence, suckling the baby at her great round brown nipples, while Kishen sat near her, scribbling a piece for his column. He was a chain-smoker, and sometimes she had enjoyed a cigarette with him. Now she returned to chewing betel, and one day she ordered Bari-Mai to prepare one for Kishen as well. “Open your mouth,” she told him, and he was about to obey her when he saw his mother’s cook making warning gestures at him from behind the door. “<em>Aré</em>—open—<em>kholo</em>, <em>bhai</em>,” Naina said impatiently. Ignoring the cook, Kishen allowed her to pop the leaf into his mouth. He disliked the taste and the feel of it. He asked, “What does she put in it?” Naina laughed. “<em>Khas cheez hai</em>—something very special to make you love Munna and me forever.”</p><p>It was Kishen’s birthday, and Mother had a gift for him. She watched him unwrap it: a slim volume tastefully bound in hand-loomed cloth, containing reprints of his newspaper and magazine articles. Full of her own excitement and pleasure, she said, “It’s all there. All your beautiful work.” He thanked her, kissed her, but he thought, Is this all you expect from me?</p><p>They were interrupted by the cook, who burst in on them, wailing, “With my own eyes!” He had seen with his own eyes how she—the witch, Bari-Mai—had stirred a powder, a poison, into Kishen’s birthday <em>pilao</em>. Naina came rushing in, shouting that Bari-Mai had wanted only to add her own touch with a pinch of saffron. “<em>Zaffran</em>,” the cook repeated angrily. “As if I don’t know <em>zaffran</em>.” Naina had already turned from him to Munna, riding on her hip. “<em>Bolo</em>—Happy birthday, Chacha-Uncle!” She thrust<span data-page="page_3"></span> him forward to greet Kishen with sticky caresses.</p><p>But later, when they were alone, she said, “It’s all lies. Don’t believe them.”</p><p>“No,” Kishen said. “I don’t believe Bari-Mai is trying to poison us.”</p><p>“They’re all crazy. <em>Pagal hai sab</em>. They think she’s a terrible witch.”</p><p>“It’s you,” he said. “You’re the terrible witch.” Before she could say anything, he went on, helplessly waving his arms, “I’m twenty-seven years old today and I haven’t done a thing. No! No, I have not written a beautiful book. Only Mother thinks so.”</p><p>“Munna thinks so,” Naina said, nibbling Munna’s ear.</p><p>“When Munna grows older, he’ll laugh at me as I’d laugh at anyone who wrote this sort of rubbish. But what’s the use of talking to you? You don’t listen to anything I try to tell you.”</p><p>“Oh, yes. I’m very stupid.”</p><p>“You are—no ideas, no theories—thank God! If you had them, if you drove me crazy the way I drive myself crazy, thinking and theorizing and doing nothing all day but sitting here with you and all night thinking about you—it’s you, you who’s poisoning me. No, don’t go away!” To keep her from leaving, he put his arms around her waist. At first too surprised to resist him, she then did so with ease. Not only was he shorter than she; he was overweight and breathless with lack of exercise. She gave him a push that sent him staggering backward to the floor, then stared down at him with angry, kohl-rimmed eyes. He stared back, partly in fear of her, partly in fear of himself and the sensation that had filled him when he touched her hot, soft flesh. The next moment, she put out her hand to pull him up; she was laughing, and he tried to laugh, too. It was all just a game between them.</p><p>When a second boy was born, Bari-Mai decided that only she could provide the nourishment her Devi needed to breast-feed two babies. She pushed aside the cook’s stainless-steel vessels for her own blackened cauldron, into which she stirred spices unwrapped from little twists of newspaper. Noxious cooking smells—asafetida, like a gas—pervaded the house. Naina moved around her urine-and-milk-soaked kingdom with one child on her hip and another sucking at her breast. Shiv’s study was moved out of earshot of the rest of the house, and as far as possible from what had been his marital bedroom and was now inhabited by both children and Bari-Mai, who stretched out on the floor, bundled in the single cloth she wore day and night.</p><p>Shiv began to come home later every night; Naina was always waiting for him. They spoke in low voices, but not intimately. Naina’s initial passion for her husband had changed into some other kind of passion, charged with resentment. Kishen, in his bedroom, willed himself not to hear, and he guessed that his mother was doing the same. When he went into her room after a restless night, he found her sitting up very straight, with her hands folded in her lap. Mother said, “Of course he comes home late—he’s very busy with meetings and conferences with the cabinet, with the Prime Minister. He’s important to the whole country.” Her voice rose. “She should be proud!”</p><p>“She <em>is</em> proud.”</p><p>“She doesn’t understand. She understands nothing.”</p><p>A modern woman, Mother had set herself against the stereotypical role of mother-in-law. She was determined not to complain about her daughter-in-law, or about the encroachments, the ruin of her ordered household. So she said nothing, not even to Kishen. Instead, she stayed out of the house at meetings of her own. Kishen suspected that she was no longer elected to the offices for which she had once been the unquestioned candidate. But still she forced herself to be present—trimly dressed, her short, stylishly cut gray hair brushed back, even a dab of lipstick and rouge applied to simulate an energy that was no longer required of her.</p><p>Meanwhile, the boys were growing up. They were no longer attached like limpets to their mother’s body. And then they grew up more and were sent off to boarding school in the hills. Kishen had expected that Bari-Mai would be sent away, too, but that didn’t happen. She still spent her nights rolled up at the foot of Naina’s marital bed while Shiv slept on the couch in his study. He was at the height of his career now, and there were photographs of him in the newspapers, hovering beside the Prime Minister at the signing of an agreement that he had helped negotiate. However late he came home, Naina waited up for him. Her voice had become more strident and desperate; Kishen listened in spite of himself, and he knew that Mother, too, was awake and listening.</p><p>During the day, he could no longer sit quietly writing his column by Naina’s side. She kept interrupting him with complaints about Shiv; and when Kishen tried to defend his brother by saying that he was working late, she brought out the newspapers with photographs of Shiv and the Prime Minister and pointed to some female under-secretary in the background. It might have been a different woman in each picture, but Naina sneered in outrage—“Is this his work? Fine work!” Once, she dragged Kishen to the room where Shiv now spent his nights; she picked up his pillow and<span data-page="page_4"></span> thrust it into Kishen’s face. “It’s <em>her</em> smell. Her dirty smell he brings home with him after he does what he does with her.” She made a sound of disgust and Bari-Mai echoed it with a splutter of saliva. More and more it seemed to Kishen that Bari-Mai was not a person at all but an emanation of something in Naina herself: something that had been bred for generations in the stifling women’s quarters of their desert home.</p><p>It was June, and the days were hot, cruelly hot. Kishen warned Mother not to go out, but one afternoon she said she had to—if she didn’t, goodness only knew what those new committee members would get up to. An hour later, the driver had to bring her back, and she was an old crushed woman. She lay on her bed and Kishen sat beside her; when he tried to get up, she clutched at his hand in a pleading gesture that she had never used with him before. She did it again, moments later, when they heard Naina’s voice outside, with Bari-Mai’s wild echo. “How do you stand it?” Mother whispered, and then he told her what he hadn’t quite told himself—that he was thinking of returning to England.</p><p>At once, she rallied. She said that he should take another degree, or at least some sort of course. “What—now?” he said, for he was almost forty. “A course in writing,” she said vaguely, and he said, teasing her, “I thought you liked my writing the way it is.” But he knew that she wanted him to leave for other reasons—in fact, for the same reasons that he wanted to go.</p><p>He looked into a writing school in Bristol, and Mother eagerly sent away for the application forms. She knew that it would take some time for these to arrive, but when six weeks had gone by she said that they would have to request them again. Although she and Kishen were alone in her bedroom, she lowered her voice: “I’ll write for them today, this time by express mail.” He nodded his consent, as though he, too, suspected that someone might be listening.</p><p>The next day, Naina invited him to go out with her. She drove with abandon, so fast that he feared for the rickshaws and the wandering animals that she kept missing by inches. His timidity amused her, so he tried not to show it and sat there tense and silent, his hands clutched between his knees.</p><p>She took him to an open-bazaar stall that was reputed to be the best for a kind of very spicy Delhi snack food. Kishen, with his delicate digestion, had never wanted to eat there, but Naina seemed perfectly at home. He watched her as she scooped up the little messes with her fingers in a trance of enjoyment; she soon sent him back for a second helping, which she finished just as quickly, and then—“I shouldn’t!”—for a third. At last she was sated, spread out on a rickety little bench as a tattered servant boy with a rag wiped the ground underneath it. She seemed oblivious of the looks of urgent desire directed at her by other customers and passersby, and by the proprietor himself, perched up on his platform stirring a vat of fly-spotted cream; or perhaps she was used to them, as she was used to the way that Kishen was looking at her across the table.</p><p>She was almost middle-aged now, her body widened, fattened by pregnancy, by excessive eating, and by long hours of deep sleep in the hot afternoons. Yet he talked to her as he had done in her youthful years, though he knew she wasn’t listening—not in the way his mother listened when he spoke of his work, or of himself.</p><p>And suddenly she interrupted him: “Why are you wanting to run back to England?”</p><p>He tried to explain it to her. He told her that it was better sometimes not to be too close to one’s source of inspiration. And, as if he were talking about her as that source, she said, “But if I don’t want you to go? If I say <em>mat jao</em>? Please stay?”</p><p>“Try to understand.” And he repeated it all—about being detached, about recollecting in tranquillity—everything that Mother and his friends in England understood and Naina didn’t. But as he talked he thought of a painting by an elderly English painter who was a friend of his mother’s; the painting depicted a giant hand caressing a mountain and was titled “I Have Touched the Breast of Mother India.” It had always made him laugh, and now Naina was laughing as though he had said something just as ludicrous.</p><p>“When will you send off your application?” she interrupted.</p><p>“As soon as it comes,” he said.</p><p>“It hasn’t come yet? No? <em>Sachmuch</em>? Really?” She suppressed a smile as she opened her handbag and dug around in its messy contents. An envelope emerged; she held it out for him to see but not to take. He realized that not only did she listen at doors; she lay in wait for letters to purloin.</p><p>Now she smiled at him openly, teasing him—and how could he help smiling back at her? “Shall I?” she said. “Tear it up?”</p><p>She held it out, pulled it back, held it out again.<span data-page="page_5"></span> It was a game now—one that he was determined to win. He leaned forward and snatched the envelope out of her hand, quite easily, because she let it go as if she knew what he would do with it: tear it in half, then in half again, all the time gazing at her for approval, which she gave.</p><p>The next time Mother asked him about the application forms, he told her that he had filled them out and sent them off. She seemed satisfied, but a day or two later she fell ill. Instead of going to her meetings, she lay in her bedroom with the curtains shut and the air-conditioner on. Her face was drawn, and because her partial denture had been removed her mouth was sunken. The doctor came—he was a friend and contemporary who had worked with her on health-care reforms. He prescribed medicines, but when those didn’t work Kishen and Shiv called in other, younger doctors. Still the sickness failed to subside, and now Mother mostly lay on her bed with her eyes closed.</p><p>Once, Bari-Mai, quick and agile as a monkey, clambered onto the bed and began to press down on Mother’s legs. Mother cried out in shock and Kishen, too, cried out, so that Naina removed Bari-Mai and both left indignantly, protesting good intentions. Alone with Kishen, Mother apologized; she said she was aware that it was unfair to see anything but a poor old woman in Bari-Mai, sunk in the rites and superstitions of a backward part of the country.</p><p>But the cook saw more than that. He came into Mother’s room and, whispering just loud enough for her and Kishen to hear, told them how all day he was on duty in the kitchen, and even at night he stayed up to watch. But who knew—worn out by his vigilance, he sometimes dropped off to sleep for a few moments, during which Bari-Mai must have insinuated her powders and potions into his pots. How else was it that Mother had been laid low by a sickness that the greatest doctors in the world were unable to cure?</p><p>“It’s unhygienic,” Shiv said, after discovering the cook asleep in the kitchen one night. When Kishen and Mother told him the reason, he said that it was psychologically unhygienic to allow such thoughts to enter their minds. Still, they continued to feel uneasy, though they were ashamed to admit it, even to each other.</p><p>It was the summer vacation, and the two boys, Munna, now fifteen, and Chottu, fourteen, came home from their boarding school in the foothills of the Himalayas. It was the same school, modelled on Eton and Harrow, that Shiv and Kishen had attended in their time. Shiv had been very successful there, Kishen less so. Both Munna and Chottu followed in their father’s footsteps, played all sports, were popular; Munna already had Shiv’s confident voice and his pompous walk.</p><p>Naina couldn’t stop petting her two boys, stroking their downy cheeks, though they frowned and pretended not to like it. They bullied her, told her she was getting too fat, and did she have to chew that disgusting betel? They made her play cricket with them in the back garden; she flew like a young girl between the wickets, flushed, her hair coming down, but they kept getting her out before she could make a single run. Bari-Mai was appointed fielder; she squatted, motionless as a stone, only her jaws moving in their perpetual mumble.</p><p>Shiv tried to come home from work earlier and, instead of shutting himself in his study, he sat with the boys to discuss their future. Munna wanted to join the Administrative Service, like his father, and Chottu was thinking of the Navy. Shiv considered their choices, the three of them serious together. Naina hovered around them with unwelcome interruptions—“Did you finish your milk, Munna?”—until he shouted at her that his name was not Munna but Raj Kumar. “Oh, big man,” she said, her angry stare directed not at her son but at his father, who tried not to meet it. That night, for the first time since the boys’ arrival, he and Naina fought again.</p><p>The older boy was especially affected by what he overheard, and the next day he sought out Kishen. Trying to answer Munna’s questions about his parents, Kishen had to admit that he knew nothing about marriage—how could he? All he knew was that there were bound to be clashes of personality, especially between two people as different as Shiv and Naina. The boy nodded. “So you think they shouldn’t be married?” he said. Kishen avoided a reply—not because he didn’t have one but because he suspected that Naina or Bari-Mai might be listening behind the door. The boy repeated his question, and when Kishen was still silent, he gave his considered opinion, as judicious and balanced as his father’s would have been: “Maybe they should get a divorce.” The next moment, Naina came flying through the door. “Divorce!” she cried. “You dare say that in this house!” She abused him in her native dialect and then she raised her hand and slapped him. The sound of the slap echoed through the house, and remained there, ineradicable even after the boys returned to school.</p><p>Shiv invited Kishen to lunch at one of the new hotels, a grand palace with slippery marble<span data-page="page_6"></span> floors and hothouse blooms in man-size vases. The prices here insured that only the richest Indians could gain admission. But the richest Indians were no longer the old style of businessmen, the ghee-fed descendants of milkmen and moneylenders: they were younger men, better travelled, almost cosmopolitan. Several of them came over to greet Shiv, with the respect that was due to him as a member of the administration that controlled permits and licenses. When they returned to their tables, Shiv informed his brother of their positions in the corporate world, the multi-<em>crore</em> companies over which they ruled. Kishen noticed his almost wistful glances at these men—and at the lively young women who accompanied them. He guessed that these were their secretaries, or perhaps their lovers, but Shiv said that they were their wives: yes, these slim, youthful women were wives, many of them mothers, too, and at the same time helpmeets, social assets to their important husbands.</p><p>Here Shiv changed the subject. He said that he had now reached the highest rank of the bureaucracy; his next posting would be as an accredited ambassador, and his success in that role would depend to a large extent on his social skills, and those of his wife. “Naina wouldn’t be happy,” he said.</p><p>“How do you know that?” Kishen said. “You don’t know. You know nothing about her.”</p><p>Shiv, too, grew more heated. “And she knows nothing about me. And cares nothing, about my work, my career—what sort of marriage is that?” He changed the subject again. “What about you? And if you don’t mind my asking—you and the Great Indian Novel?”</p><p>“I thought you liked my little pieces.”</p><p>“You shouldn’t be hanging around the house so much. You should be getting out, meeting people. The middle classes. The new generation of businessmen. The entrepreneurs.”</p><p>“And their suitable wives,” Kishen said.</p><p>Shiv’s voice became more intense, charged with suppressed anger. “She has this mad idea that I have some grand love affair going.” He laughed without laughing, cut up his meat, chewed violently.</p><p>“And is it true, her mad idea?”</p><p>“Of course not! And, if it were, who could blame me? Living in that house, in that atmosphere—no wonder Mother’s sick. We’re all sick. The stench of those beasts alone is enough to poison the lot of us.” He put down his knife and fork and stared at his brother, shocked at himself, though presumably he had been referring to the buffalo head, long since disintegrated, and the tiger pelt, which was going the same way.</p><p>Alone with Kishen in her bedroom, Mother whispered, “Have you heard from Bristol about your application?”</p><p>“They turned me down.”</p><p>He lied without a qualm, and was amazed by her reaction. She covered her face and rocked to and fro. When he caught her in his arms, she clung to him and wouldn’t let him go. How thin she was, how worn away. When she released him, he tried to smile. “I didn’t realize you were so eager to get rid of me.”</p><p>She stroked his head, regretting perhaps all the hair he had lost. Then she kissed him. “Go to England,” she said. “You’ll have peace of mind there.”</p><p>“And if I’m far away and you get worse?”</p><p>“When I know you’re writing your book, I’ll be well.”</p><p>But the next day Naina told him, “Six months, that’s all. Three months, six, a year. At home we can always tell. My uncle had a mistress, Mrs. Lal, <em>moti-taazi</em>, plump and nice—oh, he liked her very much! But Bari-Mai knew, and others knew, too. In six months, it was all gone, like a balloon, <em>psssst</em>, no more <em>moti-taazi</em>. It was God punishing her.”</p><p>“Mother has done nothing to be punished for.”</p><p>“She wants my husband to leave me. She’s even set my sons against me! You think that such thoughts would come into my child’s head if she hadn’t put them there? I slapped him, God forgive me, but now God himself is slapping her—<em>aré</em>, <em>sunno</em>, where are you going?” He had got up to leave. She caught hold of his shirt, and it ripped in her hand. That made Naina laugh—her old playful, girlish laugh, like clear water running.</p><p>Kishen began to take Mother to various specialists. She enjoyed driving with him from one clinic to another; he held her hand the way she had held his on the first day of school. Whatever the doctors said, she claimed to be perfectly well—a little pain here and there, but what was that at her age, compared with what others had to suffer? Still, she grew more and more gaunt, while Kishen looked on helplessly; and every morning Naina and Bari-Mai sat on the front veranda and watched them drive away.</p><p>Finally, Shiv decided to send her to England, to consult with a Harley Street specialist. Kishen would have to take her. If at all possible, Shiv would join them, but meanwhile he made the arrangements for his mother and brother—the plane tickets, the hotel, the appointment with the doctor.</p><p>Mother was glad to go and Kishen knew that it was for his sake. He wanted to leave, too, he thought, to be in a cool green place, to collect and recollect everything in its complexity, which was impossible here with it all pressing down on him. Yet, at the same<span data-page="page_final"></span> time, he felt guilty—maybe he had no right to go, maybe his place was here, even if he hated it.</p><p>“When are we leaving? Have our tickets come?” Mother asked Kishen so often that he began to believe there was some weakness in her mind. “Let them be sent by courier,” she said, and then, every day, “Has the courier come?”</p><p>Kishen called the travel agent, who assured him that the tickets had been sent—yes, by courier. Kishen told him to cancel those and have duplicates sent to Shiv’s office. Shiv brought them home and Kishen at once hid them in the inner pocket of his waistcoat, where he could check several times a day and know they were safe.</p><p>Naina had one of her great fights with Shiv. “Why are you sending them away? What use are your wonderful English doctors? It’s written! Written here!” Kishen, listening from Mother’s bedroom, imagined Naina drawing her finger across her forehead in the place where one’s fate is inscribed.</p><p>“She won’t last the journey,” Naina warned Kishen. “And no one there will know the ceremonies. All they have is the electric crematorium; they’ll give you the ashes and you won’t even know whose ashes they are.”</p><p>“Why are you saying all this?”</p><p>“If you go, that’s what will happen. Did your tickets come?”</p><p>The way she was looking at him, through him, it was as if she could penetrate right to his heart. But he knew that she couldn’t see even as far as the contents of his waistcoat pocket, and for once he felt he had the upper hand.</p><p>Maybe she felt it, too, for she said in a different, cajoling voice, “When you’re gone, will you remember me? Will you remember me as I was?”</p><p>He looked back at her: no, she was not as she had been. She was heavy, her complexion spotted by the spicy pickles she consumed, her mouth stained red by the betel. Even her tongue was red—like a demon’s, he sometimes thought when he was angry at her. But at this moment he was not angry; he said, “No. Now. I’ll remember you as you are now.”</p><p>She threw back her head and laughed with a deep-throated pleasure that could swallow him whole. “Will you write about me?” She took a newly prepared betel from Bari-Mai, and asked, “What will you write?”</p><p>“All the bad things you do.”</p><p>“Yes, I’m a bad woman.” She translated this for Bari-Mai, who broke into excited chatter. “Bari-Mai says she’s making you a very special <em>paan</em>.”</p><p>“Oh, yes? What’s she putting in it?”</p><p>“You’ll see—very special.” Her eyes were dancing over his face, looking to see whose turn it was to make the next move and win.</p><p>Bari-Mai handed her another betel, and Naina instructed him, “Open. <em>Kholo</em>.”</p><p>Kishen drew back slightly, and she said, “There’s nothing in it that you haven’t eaten a hundred times.”</p><p>He thought, Well, whatever it is—an aphrodisiac or whatever—it’s as superfluous now as it was all those other times. He opened his mouth and soon it was full of betel juices. “Good, isn’t it?” Naina said, and he affirmed, “<em>Badiya</em>.” Superb.</p><p>She said, “Come on. Show. <em>Dikhao</em>.”</p><p>He didn’t even pretend not to know what she was talking about. He took the tickets out of his waistcoat pocket. He handed them to her like a forfeit that he was called upon to pay.</p><p>She held them. “Shall I?” She waved them at him. “Or will you?”</p><p>“My turn,” he said.</p><p>She pouted. “You did it last time.” But she let them dangle loosely in her hand so that he could take them from her and begin to tear them in half—first his mother’s, then his own. ♦</p>	Ruth Prawer Jhabvala	July 11 & 18, 2011 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/07/11/aphrodisiac	Cambridge	Children	Cooking	Cooks	England	Families	Kishen	Third	Children
Apollo	<p>Twice <span data-page="page_1"></span>a month, like a dutiful son, I visited my parents in Enugu, in their small overfurnished flat that grew dark in the afternoon. Retirement had changed them, shrunk them. They were in their late eighties, both small and mahogany-skinned, with a tendency to stoop. They seemed to look more and more alike, as though all the years together had made their features blend and bleed into one another. They even smelled alike—a menthol scent, from the green vial of Vicks VapoRub they passed to each other, carefully rubbing a little in their nostrils and on aching joints. When I arrived, I would find them either sitting out on the veranda overlooking the road or sunk into the living-room sofa, watching Animal Planet. They had a new, simple sense of wonder. They marvelled at the wiliness of wolves, laughed at the cleverness of apes, and asked each other, “Ifukwa? Did you see that?”</p><p>They had, too, a new, baffling patience for incredible stories. Once, my mother told me that a sick neighbor in Abba, our ancestral home town, had vomited a grasshopper—a living, writhing insect, which, she said, was proof that wicked relatives had poisoned him. “Somebody texted us a picture of the grasshopper,” my father said. They always supported each other’s stories. When my father told me that Chief Okeke’s young house help had mysteriously died, and the story around town was that the chief had killed the teen-ager and used her liver for moneymaking rituals, my mother added, “They say he used the heart, too.”</p><p>Fifteen years earlier, my parents would have scoffed at these stories. My mother, a professor of political science, would have said “Nonsense” in her crisp manner, and my father, a professor of education, would merely have snorted, the stories not worth the effort of speech. It puzzled me that they had shed those old selves, and become the kind of Nigerians who told anecdotes about diabetes cured by drinking holy water.</p><p>Still, I humored them and half listened to their stories. It was a kind of innocence, this new childhood of old age. They had grown slower with the passing years, and their faces lit up at the sight of me and even their prying questions—“When will you give us a grandchild? When will you bring a girl to introduce to us?”—no longer made me as tense as before. Each time I drove away, on Sunday afternoons after a big lunch of rice and stew, I wondered if it would be the last time I would see them both alive, if before my next visit I would receive a phone call from one of them telling me to come right away. The thought filled me with a nostalgic sadness that stayed with me until I got back to Port Harcourt. And yet I knew that if I had a family, if I could complain about rising school fees as the children of their friends did, then I would not visit them so regularly. I would have nothing for which to make amends.</p><p>During a visit in November, my parents talked about the increase in armed robberies all over the east. Thieves, too, had to prepare for Christmas. My mother told me how a vigilante mob in Onitsha had caught some thieves, beaten them, and torn off their clothes—how old tires had been thrown over their heads like necklaces, amid shouts for petrol and matches, before the police arrived, fired shots in the air to disperse the crowd, and took the robbers away. My mother paused, and I waited for a supernatural detail that would embellish the story. Perhaps, just as they arrived at the police station, the thieves had turned into vultures and flown away.</p><p>“Do you know,” she continued, “one of the armed robbers, in fact the ring leader, was Raphael? He was our houseboy years ago. I don’t think you’ll remember him.”</p><p>I stared at my mother. “Raphael?”</p><p>“It’s not surprising he ended like this,” my father said. “He didn’t start well.”</p><p>My mind had been submerged in the foggy lull of my parents’ storytelling, and I struggled now with the sharp awakening of memory.</p><p>My mother said again, “You probably won’t remember him. There were so many of those houseboys. You were young.”</p><p>But I remembered. Of course I remembered Raphael.</p><p>Nothing changed when Raphael came to live with us, not at first. He seemed like all the others, an ordinary-looking teen from a nearby village. The houseboy before him, Hyginus, had been sent home for insulting my mother. Before Hyginus was John, whom I remembered because he had not been sent away; he had broken a plate while washing it and, fearing my mother’s anger, had packed his things and fled before she came home from work. All the houseboys treated me with the contemptuous care of people who disliked my mother. Please come and eat your food, they would say—I don’t want trouble from Madam. My mother regularly shouted at them, for being slow, stupid, hard of hearing; even her bell-ringing, her thumb resting on the red knob, the shrillness searing through the house, sounded like shouting. How difficult could it be to remember to fry the eggs differently, my father’s plain and hers with onions, or to put the Russian dolls back on the same shelf after dusting, or to iron my school uniform properly?<span data-page="page_2"></span></p><p>I was my parents’ only child, born late in their lives. “When I got pregnant, I thought it was menopause,” my mother told me once. I must have been around eight years old, and did not know what “menopause” meant. She had a brusque manner, as did my father; they had about them the air of people who were quick to dismiss others. They had met at the University of Ibadan, married against their families’ wishes—his thought her too educated, while hers preferred a wealthier suitor—and spent their lives in an intense and intimate competition over who published more, who won at badminton, who had the last word in an argument. They often read aloud to each other in the evening, from journals or newspapers, standing rather than sitting in the parlor, sometimes pacing, as though about to spring at a new idea. They drank Mateus rosé—that dark, shapely bottle always seemed to be resting on a table near them—and left behind glasses faint with reddish dregs. Throughout my childhood, I worried about not being quick enough to respond when they spoke to me.</p><p>I worried, too, that I did not care for books. Reading did not do to me what it did to my parents, agitating them or turning them into vague beings lost to time, who did not quite notice when I came and went. I read books only enough to satisfy them, and to answer the kinds of unexpected questions that might come in the middle of a meal—What did I think of Pip? Had Ezeulu done the right thing? I sometimes felt like an interloper in our house. My bedroom had bookshelves, stacked with the overflow books that did not fit in the study and the corridor, and they made my stay feel transient, as though I were not quite where I was supposed to be. I sensed my parents’ disappointment in the way they glanced at each other when I spoke about a book, and I knew that what I had said was not incorrect but merely ordinary, uncharged with their brand of originality. Going to the staff club with them was an ordeal: I found badminton boring, the shuttlecock seemed to me an unfinished thing, as though whoever had invented the game had stopped halfway.</p><p>What I loved was kung fu. I watched “Enter the Dragon” so often that I knew all the lines, and I longed to wake up and be Bruce Lee. I would kick and strike at the air, at imaginary enemies who had killed my imaginary family. I would pull my mattress onto the floor, stand on two thick books—usually hardcover copies of “Black Beauty” and “The Water-Babies”—and leap onto the mattress, screaming “Haaa!” like Bruce Lee. One day, in the middle of my practice, I looked up to see Raphael standing in the doorway, watching me. I expected a mild reprimand. He had made my bed that morning, and now the room was in disarray. Instead, he smiled, touched his chest, and brought his finger to his tongue, as though tasting his own blood. My favorite scene. I stared at Raphael with the pure thrill of unexpected pleasure. “I watched the film in the other house where I worked,” he said. “Look at this.”</p><p>He pivoted slightly, leaped up, and kicked, his leg straight and high, his body all taut grace. I was twelve years old and had, until then, never felt that I recognized myself in another person.</p><p>Raphael and I practiced in the back yard, leaping from the raised concrete soakaway and landing on the grass. Raphael told me to suck in my belly, to keep my legs straight and my fingers precise. He taught me to breathe. My previous attempts, in the enclosure of my room, had felt stillborn. Now, outside with Raphael, slicing the air with my arms, I could feel my practice become real, with soft grass below and high sky above, and the endless space mine to conquer. This was truly happening. I could become a black belt one day. Outside the kitchen door was a high open veranda, and I wanted to jump off its flight of six steps and try a flying kick. “No,” Raphael said. “That veranda is too high.”</p><p>On weekends, if my parents went to the staff club without me, Raphael and I watched Bruce Lee videotapes, Raphael saying, “Watch it! Watch it!” Through his eyes, I saw the films anew; some moves that I had thought merely competent became luminous when he said, “Watch it!” Raphael knew what really mattered; his wisdom lay easy on his skin. He rewound the sections in which Bruce Lee used a nunchaku, and watched unblinking, gasping at the clean aggression of the metal-and-wood weapon.</p><p>“I wish I had a nunchaku,” I said.</p><p>“It is very difficult to use,” Raphael said firmly, and I felt almost sorry to have wanted one.</p><p>Not long afterward, I came back from school one day and Raphael said, “See.” From the cupboard he took out a nunchaku—two pieces of wood, cut from an old cleaning mop and sanded down, held together by a spiral of metal springs. He must have been making it for at least a week, in his free time after his housework. He showed me how to use it. His moves seemed clumsy, nothing like Bruce Lee’s.<span data-page="page_3"></span> I took the nunchaku and tried to swing it, but only ended up with a thump on my chest. Raphael laughed. “You think you can just start like that?” he said. “You have to practice for a long time.”</p><p>At school, I sat through classes thinking of the wood’s smoothness in the palm of my hand. It was after school, with Raphael, that my real life began. My parents did not notice how close Raphael and I had become. All they saw was that I now happened to play outside, and Raphael was, of course, part of the landscape of outside: weeding the garden, washing pots at the water tank. One afternoon, Raphael finished plucking a chicken and interrupted my solo practice on the lawn. “Fight!” he said. A duel began, his hands bare, mine swinging my new weapon. He pushed me hard. One end hit him on the arm, and he looked surprised and then impressed, as if he had not thought me capable. I swung again and again. He feinted and dodged and kicked. Time collapsed. In the end, we were both panting and laughing. I remember, even now, very clearly, the smallness of his shorts that afternoon, and how the muscles ran wiry like ropes down his legs.</p><p>On weekends, I ate lunch with my parents. I always ate quickly, dreaming of escape and hoping that they would not turn to me with one of their test questions. At one lunch, Raphael served white disks of boiled yam on a bed of greens, and then cubed pawpaw and pineapple.</p><p>“The vegetable was too tough,” my mother said. “Are we grass-eating goats?” She glanced at him. “What is wrong with your eyes?”</p><p>It took me a moment to realize that this was not her usual figurative lambasting—“What is that big object blocking your nose?” she would ask, if she noticed a smell in the kitchen that he had not. The whites of Raphael’s eyes were red. A painful, unnatural red. He mumbled that an insect had flown into them.</p><p>“It looks like Apollo,” my father said.</p><p>My mother pushed back her chair and examined Raphael’s face. “Ah-ah! Yes, it is. Go to your room and stay there.”</p><p>Raphael hesitated, as though wanting to finish clearing the plates.</p><p>“Go!” my father said. “Before you infect us all with this thing.”</p><p>Raphael, looking confused, edged away from the table. My mother called him back. “Have you had this before?”</p><p>“No, Madam.”</p><p>“It’s an infection of your conjunctiva, the thing that covers your eyes,” she said. In the midst of her Igbo words, “conjunctiva” sounded sharp and dangerous. “We’re going to buy medicine for you. Use it three times a day and stay in your room. Don’t cook until it clears.” Turning to me, she said, “Okenwa, make sure you don’t go near him. Apollo is very infectious.” From her perfunctory tone, it was clear that she did not imagine I would have any reason to go near Raphael.</p><p>Later, my parents drove to the pharmacy in town and came back with a bottle of eye drops, which my father took to Raphael’s room in the boys’ quarters, at the back of the house, with the air of someone going reluctantly into battle. That evening, I went with my parents to Obollo Road to buy akara for dinner; when we returned, it felt strange not to have Raphael open the front door, not to find him closing the living-room curtains and turning on the lights. In the quiet kitchen, our house seemed emptied of life. As soon as my parents were immersed in themselves, I went out to the boys’ quarters and knocked on Raphael’s door. It was ajar. He was lying on his back, his narrow bed pushed against the wall, and turned when I came in, surprised, making as if to get up. I had never been in his room before. The exposed light bulb dangling from the ceiling cast sombre shadows.</p><p>“What is it?” he asked.</p><p>“Nothing. I came to see how you are.”</p><p>He shrugged and settled back down on the bed. “I don’t know how I got this. Don’t come close.”</p><p>But I went close.</p><p>“I had Apollo in Primary 3,” I said. “It will go quickly, don’t worry. Have you used the eye drops this evening?”</p><p>He shrugged and said nothing. The bottle of eye drops sat unopened on the table.</p><p>“You haven’t used them at all?” I asked.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>He avoided looking at me. “I cannot do it.”</p><p>Raphael, who could disembowel a turkey and lift a full bag of rice, could not drip liquid medicine into his eyes. At first, I was astonished, then amused, and then moved. I looked around his room and was struck by how bare it was—the bed pushed against the wall, a spindly table, a gray metal box in the corner, which I assumed contained all that he owned.</p><p>“I will put the drops in for you,” I said. I took the bottle and twisted off the cap.</p><p>“Don’t come close,” he said again.</p><p>I was already close. I bent over him. He began a frantic blinking.</p><p>“Breathe like in kung fu,” I said.</p><p>I touched his face, gently pulled down his lower left eyelid, and dropped the liquid into his eye. The other lid I pulled more firmly, because he had shut his eyes tight.<span data-page="page_4"></span></p><p>“Ndo,” I said. “Sorry.”</p><p>He opened his eyes and looked at me, and on his face shone something wondrous. I had never felt myself the subject of admiration. It made me think of science class, of a new maize shoot growing greenly toward light. He touched my arm. I turned to go.</p><p>“I’ll come before I go to school,” I said.</p><p>In the morning, I slipped into his room, put in his eye drops, and slipped out and into my father’s car, to be dropped off at school.</p><p>By the third day, Raphael’s room felt familiar to me, welcoming, uncluttered by objects. As I put in the drops, I discovered things about him that I guarded closely: the early darkening of hair above his upper lip, the ringworm patch in the hollow between his jaw and his neck. I sat on the edge of his bed and we talked about “Snake in the Monkey’s Shadow.” We had discussed the film many times, and we said things that we had said before, but in the quiet of his room they felt like secrets. Our voices were low, almost hushed. His body’s warmth cast warmth over me.</p><p>He got up to demonstrate the snake style, and afterward, both of us laughing, he grasped my hand in his. Then he let go and moved slightly away from me.</p><p>“This Apollo has gone,” he said.</p><p>His eyes were clear. I wished he had not healed so quickly.</p><p>I dreamed of being with Raphael and Bruce Lee in an open field, practicing for a fight. When I woke up, my eyes refused to open. I pried my lids apart. My eyes burned and itched. Each time I blinked, they seemed to produce more pale ugly fluid that coated my lashes. It felt as if heated grains of sand were under my eyelids. I feared that something inside me was thawing that was not supposed to thaw.</p><p>My mother shouted at Raphael, “Why did you bring this thing to my house? Why?” It was as though by catching Apollo he had conspired to infect her son. Raphael did not respond. He never did when she shouted at him. She was standing at the top of the stairs, and Raphael was below her.</p><p>“How did he manage to give you Apollo from his room?” my father asked me.</p><p>“It wasn’t Raphael. I think I got it from somebody in my class,” I told my parents.</p><p>“Who?” I should have known my mother would ask. At that moment, my mind erased all my classmates’ names.</p><p>“Who?” she asked again.</p><p>“Chidi Obi,” I said finally, the first name that came to me. He sat in front of me and smelled like old clothes.</p><p>“Do you have a headache?” my mother asked.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>My father brought me Panadol. My mother telephoned Dr. Igbokwe. My parents were brisk. They stood by my door, watching me drink a cup of Milo that my father had made. I drank quickly. I hoped that they would not drag an armchair into my room, as they did every time I was sick with malaria, when I would wake up with a bitter tongue to find one parent inches from me, silently reading a book, and I would will myself to get well quickly, to free them.</p><p>Dr. Igbokwe arrived and shined a torch in my eyes. His cologne was strong; I could smell it long after he’d gone, a heady scent close to alcohol that I imagined would worsen nausea. After he left, my parents created a patient’s altar by my bed—on a table covered with cloth, they put a bottle of orange Lucozade, a blue tin of glucose, and freshly peeled oranges on a plastic tray. They did not bring the armchair, but one of them was home throughout the week that I had Apollo. They took turns putting in my eye drops, my father more clumsily than my mother, leaving sticky liquid running down my face. They did not know how well I could put in the drops myself. Each time they raised the bottle above my face, I remembered the look in Raphael’s eyes that first evening in his room, and I felt haunted by happiness.</p><p>My parents closed the curtains and kept my room dark. I was sick of lying down. I wanted to see Raphael, but my mother had banned him from my room, as though he could somehow make my condition worse. I wished that he would come and see me. Surely he could pretend to be putting away a bedsheet, or bringing a bucket to the bathroom. Why didn’t he come? He had not even said sorry to me. I strained to hear his voice, but the kitchen was too far away and his voice, when he spoke to my mother, was too low.</p><p>Once, after going to the toilet, I tried to sneak downstairs to the kitchen, but my father loomed at the bottom of the stairs.</p><p>“Kedu?” He asked. “Are you all right?”</p><p>“I want water,” I said.</p><p>“I’ll bring it. Go and lie down.”</p><p>Finally, my parents went out together. I had been sleeping, and woke up to sense the emptiness of the house. I hurried downstairs and to the kitchen. It, too, was empty. I wondered if Raphael was in the boys’ quarters; he was not supposed to<span data-page="page_final"></span> go to his room during the day, but maybe he had, now that my parents were away. I went out to the open veranda. I heard Raphael’s voice before I saw him, standing near the tank, digging his foot into the sand, talking to Josephine, Professor Nwosu’s house help. Professor Nwosu sometimes sent eggs from his poultry, and never let my parents pay for them. Had Josephine brought eggs? She was tall and plump; now she had the air of someone who had already said goodbye but was lingering. With her, Raphael was different—the slouch in his back, the agitated foot. He was shy. She was talking to him with a kind of playful power, as though she could see through him to things that amused her. My reason blurred.</p><p>“Raphael!” I called out.</p><p>He turned. “Oh. Okenwa. Are you allowed to come downstairs?”</p><p>He spoke as though I were a child, as though we had not sat together in his dim room.</p><p>“I’m hungry! Where is my food?” It was the first thing that came to me, but in trying to be imperious I sounded shrill.</p><p>Josephine’s face puckered, as though she were about to break into slow, long laughter. Raphael said something that I could not hear, but it had the sound of betrayal. My parents drove up just then, and suddenly Josephine and Raphael were roused. Josephine hurried out of the compound, and Raphael came toward me. His shirt was stained in the front, orangish, like palm oil from soup. Had my parents not come back, he would have stayed there mumbling by the tank; my presence had changed nothing.</p><p>“What do you want to eat?” he asked.</p><p>“You didn’t come to see me.”</p><p>“You know Madam said I should not go near you.”</p><p>Why was he making it all so common and ordinary? I, too, had been asked not to go to his room, and yet I had gone, I had put in his eye drops every day.</p><p>“After all, you gave me the Apollo,” I said.</p><p>“Sorry.” He said it dully, his mind elsewhere.</p><p>I could hear my mother’s voice. I was angry that they were back. My time with Raphael was shortened, and I felt the sensation of a widening crack.</p><p>“Do you want plantain or yam?” Raphael asked, not to placate me but as if nothing serious had happened. My eyes were burning again. He came up the steps. I moved away from him, too quickly, to the edge of the veranda, and my rubber slippers shifted under me. Unbalanced, I fell. I landed on my hands and knees, startled by the force of my own weight, and I felt the tears coming before I could stop them. Stiff with humiliation, I did not move.</p><p>My parents appeared.</p><p>“Okenwa!” my father shouted.</p><p>I stayed on the ground, a stone sunk in my knee. “Raphael pushed me.”</p><p>“What?” My parents said it at the same time, in English. “What?”</p><p>There was time. Before my father turned to Raphael, and before my mother lunged at him as if to slap him, and before she told him to go pack his things and leave immediately, there was time. I could have spoken. I could have cut into that silence. I could have said that it was an accident. I could have taken back my lie and left my parents merely to wonder. ♦</p>	Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie	April 13, 2015 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/13/apollo	Children	Nigeria	Parents				Okenwa	First	Children
Bad Dreams	<p>A <span data-page="page_1"></span>child woke up in the dark. She seemed to swim up into consciousness as if to a surface, which she then broke through, looking around with her eyes open. At first, the darkness was implacable. She might have arrived anywhere: all that was certain was her own self, lying on her side, her salty smell and her warmth, her knees pulled up to her skinny chest inside the cocoon of her brushed-nylon nightdress. But as she stared into the darkness familiar forms began to loom through it: the pale outline of a window, printed by the street lamp against the curtains; the horizontals on the opposite wall, which were the shelves where she and her brother kept their books and toys. Beside the window she could make out a rectangle of wool cloth tacked up; her mother had appliquéd onto it a sleigh and two horses and a driver cracking his whip, first gluing on the pieces and then outlining them with machine stitching—star shapes in blue thread for the falling snowflakes, lines of red stitching for the reins and the twisting whip. The child knew all these details by heart, though she couldn’t see them in the dark. She was where she always was when she woke up: in her own bedroom, in the top bunk, her younger brother asleep in the lower one.</p><p>Her mother and father were in bed and asleep, too. The basement flat was small enough that, if they were awake, she would have heard the sewing machine or the wireless, or her father practicing the trumpet or playing jazz records. She struggled to sit up out of the tightly wound nest of sheets and blankets; she was asthmatic and feared not being able to catch her breath. Cold night air struck her shoulders. It was strange to stare into the room with wide-open eyes and feel the darkness yielding only the smallest bit, as if it were pressing back against her efforts to penetrate it. Something had happened, she was sure, while she was asleep. She didn’t know what it was at first, but the strong dread it had left behind didn’t subside with the confusion of waking. Then she remembered that this thing had happened inside her sleep, in her dream. She had dreamed something horrible, and so plausible that it was vividly present as soon as she remembered it.</p><p>She had dreamed that she was reading her favorite book, the one she read over and over and actually had been reading earlier that night, until her mother came to turn off the light. In fact, she could feel the book’s hard corner pressing into her leg now through the blankets. In the dream, she had been turning its pages as usual when, beyond the story’s familiar last words, she discovered an extra section that she had never seen before, a short paragraph set on a page by itself, headed “Epilogue.” She was an advanced reader for nine and knew about prologues and epilogues—though it didn’t occur to her then that she was the author of her own dreams and must have invented this epilogue herself. It seemed so completely a found thing, alien and unanticipated, coming from outside herself, against her will.</p><p>In the real book she loved, “Swallows and Amazons,” six children spent their summers in perfect freedom, sailing dinghies on a lake, absorbed in adventures and rivalries that were half invented games and half truth, pushing across the threshold of safety into a thrilling unknown. All the details in the book had the solidity of life, though it wasn’t her own life—she didn’t have servants or boats or a lake or an absent father in the Navy. She had read all the other books in the series, too, and she acted out their stories with her friends at school, although they lived in a city and none of them had ever been sailing. The world of “Swallows and Amazons” existed in a dimension parallel to their own, touching it only in their games. They had a “Swallows and Amazons” club, and took turns bringing in “grub” to eat, “grog” and “pemmican”; they sewed badges, and wrote notes in secret code. All of them wanted to be Nancy Blackett, the strutting pirate girl, though they would settle for Titty Walker, sensitive and watchful.</p><p>Now the child seemed to see the impersonal print of the dream epilogue, written on the darkness in front of her eyes. <em>John and Roger both went on to,</em> it began, in a businesslike voice. Of course, the words weren’t actually in front of her eyes, and parts of what was written were elusive when she sought them; certain sentences, though, were scored into her awareness as sharply as if she’d heard them read aloud. <em>Roger drowned at sea in his twenties.</em> Roger was the youngest of them all, the ship’s boy, in whom she had only ever been mildly interested: this threw him into a terrible new prominence. <em>John suffered with a bad heart. The Blackett sisters . . . long illnesses. Titty, killed in an unfortunate accident.</em> The litany of deaths tore jaggedly into the tissue that the book had woven, making everything lopsided and hideous. The epilogue’s gloating bland language, complacently regretful, seemed to relish catching her out in her dismay. Oh, didn’t you know? <em>Susan lived to a ripe old age</em>. Susan<span data-page="page_2"></span> was the dullest of the Swallows, tame and sensible, in charge of cooking and housekeeping. Still, the idea of her “ripe old age” was full of horror: wasn’t she just a girl, with everything ahead of her?</p><p>The child knew that the epilogue existed only in her dream, but she couldn’t dispel the taint of it, clinging to her thoughts. When she was younger, she had called to her mother if she woke in the night, but something stopped her from calling out now: she didn’t want to tell anyone about her dream. Once the words were said aloud, she would never be rid of them; it was better to keep them hidden. And she was afraid, anyway, that her mother wouldn’t understand the awfulness of the dream if she tried to explain it: she might laugh or think it was silly. For the first time, the child felt as if she were alone in her own home—its rooms spread out about her, invisible in the night, seemed unlike their usual selves. The book touching her leg through the blankets frightened her, and she thought she might never be able to open it again. Not wanting to lie down in the place where she’d had the dream, she swung over the side rail of the bed and reached with her bare feet for the steps of the ladder—the lower bunk was a cave so dark that she couldn’t make out the shape of her sleeping brother. Then she felt the carpet’s gritty wool under her toes.</p><p>The children’s bedroom, the bathroom, papered in big blue roses, and their parents’ room were all at the front of the massive Victorian house, which was four stories tall, including this basement flat; sometimes the child was aware of the other flats above theirs, full of the furniture of other lives, pressing down on their heads. Quietly she opened her bedroom door. The doors to the kitchen and the lounge, which were at the back of the flat, stood open onto the windowless hallway; a thin blue light, falling through them, lay in rectangles on the hall carpet. She had read about moonlight, but had never taken in its reality before: it made the lampshade of Spanish wrought iron, which had always hung from a chain in the hallway, seem suddenly as barbaric as a cage or a portcullis in a castle.</p><p>Everything was tidy in the kitchen: the dishcloth had been wrung out and hung on the edge of the plastic washing-up bowl; something on a plate was wrapped in greaseproof paper; the sewing machine was put away under its cover at one end of the table. The pieces of Liberty lawn print, which her mother was cutting out for one of her ladies, were folded carefully in their paper bag to keep them clean. <em>Liberty lawn:</em> her mother named it reverently, like an incantation—though the daily business of her sewing wasn’t reverent but briskly pragmatic, cutting and pinning and snipping at seams with pinking shears, running the machine with her head bent close to the work in bursts of concentration, one hand always raised to the wheel to slow it, or breaking threads quickly in the little clip behind the needle. The chatter of the sewing machine, racing and easing and halting and starting up again, was like a busy engine driving their days. There were always threads and pins scattered on the floor around where her mother was working—you had to be careful where you stepped.</p><p>In the lounge, the child paddled her toes in the hair of the white goatskin rug. Gleaming, uncanny, half reverted to its animal past, the rug yearned to the moon, which was balanced on top of the wall at the back of the paved yard. The silver frame of her parents’ wedding photograph and the yellow brass of her father’s trumpet—in its case with the lid open, beside the music stand—shone with the same pale light. Lifting the heavy lid of the gramophone, she breathed in the forbidden smell of the records nestled in their felt-lined compartments, then touched the pages heaped on her father’s desk: his meaning, densely tangled in his black italic writing, seemed more accessible through her fingertips in the dark than it ever was in daylight, when its difficulty thwarted her. He was studying for his degree in the evenings, after teaching at school all day. She and her brother played quietly so as not to disturb him; their mother had impressed upon them the importance of his work. He was writing about a book, “Leviathan”: his ink bottle had left imprints on the desk’s leather inlay, and he stored his notes on a shelf in cardboard folders, carefully labelled—the pile of folders growing ever higher. The child was struck by the melancholy of this accumulation: sometimes she felt a pang of fear for her father, as if he were exposed and vulnerable—and yet when he wasn’t working he charmed her with his jokes, pretending to be poisoned when he tasted the cakes she had made, teasing her school friends until they blushed. She never feared in the same way for her mother: her mother was capable; she was the whole world.</p><p>In their absence, her parents were more distinctly present to her than usual, as individuals with their own unfathomable adult preoccupations. She was aware of<span data-page="page_3"></span> their lives running backward from this moment, into a past that she could never enter. This moment, too, the one fitted around her now as inevitably and closely as a skin, would one day become the past: its details then would seem remarkable and poignant, and she would never be able to return inside them. The chairs in the lounge, formidable in the dimness, seemed drawn up as if for a spectacle, waiting more attentively than if they were filled with people: the angular recliner built of black tubular steel, with lozenges of polished wood for arms; the cone-shaped wicker basket in its round wrought-iron frame; the black-painted wooden armchair with orange cushions; and the low divan covered in striped olive-green cotton. The reality of the things in the room seemed more substantial to the child than she was herself—and she wanted in a sudden passion to break something, to disrupt this world of her home, sealed in its mysterious stillness, where her bare feet made no sound on the lino or the carpets.</p><p>On impulse, using all her strength, she pushed at the recliner from behind, tipping it over slowly until it was upside down, with its top resting on the carpet and its legs in the air, the rubber ferrules on its feet unexpectedly silly in the moonlight, like prim, tiny shoes. Then she tipped over the painted chair, so that its cushions flopped out. She pulled the wicker cone out of its frame and turned the frame over, flipped up the goatskin rug. She managed to make very little noise, just a few soft bumps and thuds; when she had finished, though, the room looked as if a hurricane had blown through it, throwing the chairs about. She was shocked by what she’d effected, but gratified, too: the after-sensation of strenuous work tingled in her legs and arms, and she was breathing fast; her whole body rejoiced in the chaos. Perhaps it would be funny when her parents saw it in the morning. At any rate, nothing—<em>nothing</em>—would ever make her tell them that she’d done it. They would never know, and that was funny, too. A private hilarity bubbled up in her, though she wouldn’t give way to it; she didn’t want to make a sound. At that very moment, as she surveyed her crazy handiwork, the moon sank below the top of the wall outside and the room darkened, all its solidity withdrawn.</p><p>The child’s mother woke up early, in the dawn. Had her little boy called out to her? He sometimes woke in the night and had strange fits of crying, during which he didn’t recognize her and screamed in her arms for his mummy. She listened, but heard nothing—yet she was as fully, promptly awake as if there had been some summons or a bell had rung. Carefully she sat up, not wanting to wake her sleeping husband, who was lying on his side, with his knees drawn up and his back to her, the bristle of his crew cut the only part of him visible above the blankets. The room was just as she had left it when she went to sleep, except that his clothes were thrown on top of hers on the chair; he had stayed up late, working on his essay. She remembered dimly that when he got into bed she had turned over, snuggling up to him, and that in her dream she had seemed to fit against the shape of him as sweetly as a nut into its shell, losing herself inside him. But now he was lost, somewhere she couldn’t follow him. Sometimes in the mornings, especially if they hadn’t made love the night before, she would wake to find herself beside this stranger, buried away from her miles deep, frowning in his sleep. His immobility then seemed a kind of comment, or a punishment, directed at her.</p><p>The gray light in the room was diffuse and hesitant. Even on sunny days, these rooms at the front of the flat weren’t bright. She had been happy in this flat at first, in the new freedom of her married life, but now she resented the neighbors always brooding overhead and was impatient to move to a place they could have all to themselves. But that would have to wait until he finished his degree. She eased out from under the warmth of the blankets. Now that she was thoroughly awake she needed to pee before she tried to sleep again. As she got out of bed, her reflection stood up indefatigably to meet her in the gilt-framed mirror that was one of her junk-shop finds, mounted in an alcove beside the window, with a trailing philodendron trained around it. The phantom in the baby-doll nightdress was enough like Monica Vitti (everyone said she looked like Monica Vitti) to make her straighten her back in self-respect; and she was aware of yesterday’s L’Air du Temps in the sleepy heat of her skin.</p><p>In the hall, she listened at the door of the children’s room, which stood ajar—nothing. The lavatory was chilly: its tiny high window made it feel like a prison cell, but a blackbird sang liquidly outside in the yard. On the way back to bed, she looked into the kitchen, where everything was as she’d left it—he hadn’t even made his cocoa or eaten the sandwich<span data-page="page_4"></span> she’d put out for him, before he came to bed. His refraining made her tense her jaw, as if he had repudiated her and preferred his work. She should have been a painter, she thought in a flash of anger, not a housewife and a dressmaker. But at art college she’d been overawed by the fine-arts students, who were mostly experienced grown men, newly returned from doing their national service in India and Malaya. Still, her orderly kitchen reassured her: the scene of her daily activity, poised and quiescent now, awaiting the morning, when she’d pick it up again with renewed energy. Perhaps he’d like bacon for his breakfast—she had saved up her housekeeping to buy him some. His mother had cooked bacon for him every morning.</p><p>When she glanced into the lounge, her shock at the sight of the chairs thrown about was as extreme as a hand clapped over her mouth from behind. The violence was worse because it was frozen in silence—had lain in wait, gloating, while she suspected nothing. Someone had broken in. She was too afraid in the first moments to call out to her husband. She waited in the doorway, holding her breath, for the movement that would give the intruder away; it was awful to think that a few minutes ago she had gone unprotected all the way down the lonely passageway to the lavatory. Then, as her panic subsided, she took in the odd specificity of the chaos. Only the chairs were overturned, at the center of the room; nothing else had been touched, nothing pulled off the shelves and thrown on the floor, nothing smashed. The lounge windows were tightly closed—just as the back door had surely been closed in the kitchen. Nothing had been taken. Had it? The wireless was intact on its shelf. Rousing out of her stupor, she crossed to the desk and opened the drawer where her husband kept his band earnings. The money was safe: three pound ten in notes and some loose change, along with his pipe and pipe cleaners and dirty tobacco pouch, the smell of which stayed on her fingers when she closed the drawer.</p><p>Instead of waking her husband, she tried the window catches, then went around checking the other rooms of the flat. The kitchen door and the front door were both securely bolted, and no one could have climbed in through the tiny window in the lavatory. Soundless on her bare feet, she entered the children’s bedroom and stood listening to their breathing. Her little boy stirred in his sleep but didn’t cry; her daughter was spread-eagled awkwardly amid the menagerie of her stuffed toys and dolls. Their window, too, was fastened shut. There was no intruder in the flat, and only one explanation for the crazy scene in the front room: her imagination danced with affront and dismay. Chilled, she returned to stand staring in the lounge. Her husband was moody, and she’d always known that he had anger buried in him. But he’d never done anything like this before—nothing so naked and outrageous. She supposed he must have got frustrated with his studies before he came to bed. Or was the disorder a derisory message meant for her, because he despised her homemaking, her domestication of the free life he’d once had? Perhaps the mess was even supposed to be some kind of brutal joke. She couldn’t imagine how she had slept through the outburst.</p><p>This time, for once, she was clearly in the right, wasn’t she? He had been childish, giving way to his frustration—as if she didn’t feel fed up sometimes. And he criticized her for her bad temper! He had such high standards for everyone else! From now on, she would hold on to this new insight into him, no matter how reasonable he seemed. Her disdain hurt her, like a bruise to the chest; she was more used to admiring him. But it was also exhilarating: she seemed to see the future with great clarity, looking forward through a long tunnel of antagonism, in which her husband was her enemy. This awful truth appeared to be something she had always known, though in the past it had been clouded in uncertainty and now she saw it starkly. Calmly and quietly she picked up each chair, put back the cushions, which had tumbled onto the carpet, straightened the goatskin rug. The room looked as serene as if nothing had ever happened in it. The joke of its serenity erupted inside her like bubbles of soundless laughter. Nothing—<em>nothing</em>—would ever make her acknowledge what he’d done, or the message he’d left for her, although when he saw the room restored to its rightful order, he would know that she knew. She would wait for him to be the first to acknowledge in words the passage of this silent violence between them.</p><p>In the bedroom, she lay down beside her husband with her back turned; her awareness of her situation seemed pure and brilliant, and she expected to lie awake, burning at his nearness. There was less than an hour to wait before she had to get up again; she’d got back into bed only because her feet were cold and it was too early to switch on the electric fire in the kitchen. But almost at once she dropped into a deep sleep—particularly blissful, as if she<span data-page="page_final"></span> were falling down through syrupy darkness, her limbs unbound and bathing in warmth. When she woke again—this time her little boy really was calling out to her—she remembered immediately what had happened in the night, but she also felt refreshed and blessed.</p><p>A young wife fried bacon for her husband: the smell of it filled the flat. Her son was eating cereal at the table. Her husband was preoccupied, packing exercise books into his worn briefcase, opening the drawer in his desk where he kept his pipe and tobacco, dropping these into the pocket of his tweed jacket. But he came at some point to stand behind his wife at the stove and put his arms around her, nuzzling her neck, kissing her behind her ear, and she leaned back into his kiss, as she always did, tilting her head to give herself to him.</p><p>When the bacon was ready, she served it up on a plate with fried bread and a tomato and poured his tea, then went to find out why their daughter was dawdling in the bedroom. The girl was sitting on the edge of her brother’s bunk, trying to pull on her knee-length socks with one hand while she held a book open in front of her eyes with the other. Her thin freckled face was nothing like her mother’s. One white sock was twisted around her leg with its dirty heel sticking out at the front, and the book was surely the same one she had already read several times. The child was insistent, though, that she needed to start reading it all over again, from the beginning. Her mother took the book away and chivvied her along. ♦</p>	Tessa Hadley	September 23, 2013 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/09/23/bad-dreams-3	Bedrooms	Books	Chairs	Children	Darkness	Death	Unnamed	Third	Children
Bohemians	<p>In <span data-page="page_1"></span>a lovely urban coincidence, the last two houses on our block were both occupied by widows who had lost their husbands in Eastern European pogroms. Dad called them the Bohemians. He called anyone white with an accent a Bohemian. Whenever he saw one of the Bohemians, he greeted her by mispronouncing the Czech word for “door.” Neither Bohemian was Czech, but both were polite, so when Dad said “door” to them they answered cordially, as if he weren’t perennially schlockered.</p><p>Mrs. Poltoi, the stouter Bohemian, had spent the war in a crawl space, splitting a daily potato with five cousins. Consequently she was bitter and claustrophobic and loved food. If you ate something while standing near her, she stared at it going into your mouth. She wore only black. She said the Catholic Church was a jewelled harlot drinking the blood of the poor. She said America was a spoiled child ignorant of grief. When our ball rolled onto her property, she seized it and waddled into her back yard and pitched it into the quarry.</p><p>Mrs. Hopanlitski, on the other hand, was thin, and joyfully made pipe-cleaner animals. When I brought home one of her crude dogs in top hats, Mom said, “Take over your Mold-A-Hero. To her, it will seem like the toy of a king.” To Mom, the camps, massacres, and railroad sidings of twenty years before were as unreal as covered wagons. When Mrs. H. claimed her family had once owned serfs, Mom’s attention wandered. She had a tract house in mind. No way was she getting one. We were renting a remodelled garage behind the Giancarlos, and Dad was basically drinking up the sporting-goods store. His N.F.L. helmets were years out of date. I’d stop by after school and find the store closed and Dad getting sloshed among the fake legs with Bennie Delmonico at Prosthetics World.</p><p>Using the Mold-A-Hero, I cast Mrs. H. a plastic Lafayette, and she said she’d keep it forever on her sill. Within a week, she’d given it to Elizabeth the Raccoon. I didn’t mind. Raccoon, an only child like me, had nothing. The Kletz brothers called her Raccoon for the bags she had under her eyes from never sleeping. Her parents fought non-stop. They fought over breakfast. They fought in the yard in their underwear. At dusk they stood on their porch whacking each other with lengths of weather stripping. Raccoon practically had spinal curvature from spending so much time slumped over with misery. When the Kletz brothers called her Raccoon, she indulged them by rubbing her hands together ferally. The nickname was the most attention she’d ever had. Sometimes she’d wish to be hit by a car so she could come back as a true raccoon and track down the Kletzes and give them rabies.</p><p>“Never wish harm on yourself or others,” Mrs. H. said. “You are a lovely child.” Her English was flat and clear, almost like ours.</p><p>“Raccoon, you mean,” Raccoon said. “A lovely raccoon.”</p><p>“A lovely child of God,” Mrs. H. said.</p><p>“Yeah, right,” Raccoon said. “Tell again about the prince.”</p><p>So Mrs. H. told again how she’d stood rapt in her yard watching an actual prince powder his birthmark to invisibility. She remembered the smell of burning compost from the fields, and men in colorful leggings dragging a gutted boar across a wooden bridge. This was before she was forced to become a human pack animal in the Carpathians, carrying the personal belongings of cruel officers. At night, they chained her to a tree. Sometimes they burned her calves with a machine-gun barrel for fun. Which was why she always wore kneesocks. After three years, she’d come home to find her babies in tiny graves. They were, she would say, short-lived but wonderful gifts. She did not now begrudge God for taking them. A falling star is brief, but isn’t one nonetheless glad to have seen it? Her grace made us hate Mrs. Poltoi all the more. What was eating a sixth of a potato every day compared to being chained to a tree? What was being crammed in with a bunch of your cousins compared to having your kids killed?</p><p>The summer I was ten, Raccoon and I, already borderline rejects due to our mutually unravelling households, were joined by Art Siminiak, who had recently made the mistake of inviting the Kletzes in for lemonade. There was no lemonade. Instead, there was Art’s mom and a sailor from Great Lakes passed out naked across the paper-drive stacks on the Siminiaks’ sunporch.</p><p>This new, three-way friendship consisted of slumping in gangways, playing gloveless catch with a Wiffle, trailing hopefully behind kids whose homes could be entered without fear of fiasco.</p><p>Over on Mozart lived Eddie the Vacant. Eddie was seventeen, huge and simple. He could crush a walnut in his bare hand, but first you had to put it there and tell him to do it. Once he’d pinned a “Vacant” sign to his shirt and walked around the neighborhood that way, and the name had stuck. Eddie claimed to see birds. Different birds appeared on different days of the week. Also, there was a Halloween bird and a Christmas bird.</p><p>One day, as Eddie hobbled by, we asked what kind of birds he was seeing.</p><p>“Party birds,” he said. “They got big streamers coming out they butts.”</p><p>“You having a party?”<span data-page="page_2"></span> said Art. “You having a homo party?”</p><p>“I gone have a birthday party,” said Eddie, blinking shyly.</p><p>“Your dad know?” Raccoon said.</p><p>“No, he don’t yet,” said Eddie.</p><p>His plans for the party were private and illogical. We peppered him with questions, hoping to get him to further embarrass himself. The party would be held in his garage. As far as the junk car in there, he would push it out by hand. As far as the oil on the floor, he would soak it up using Handi Wipes. As far as music, he would play a trumpet.</p><p>“What are you going to play the trumpet with?” said Art. “Your asshole?”</p><p>“No, I not gone play it with that,” Eddie said. “I just gone use my lips, O.K.?”</p><p>As far as girls, there would be girls; he knew many girls, from his job managing the Drake Hotel, he said. As far as food, there would be food, including pudding dumplings.</p><p>“You’re the manager of the Drake Hotel,” Raccoon said.</p><p>“Hey, I know how to get the money for pudding dumplings!” Eddie said.</p><p>Then he rang Poltoi’s bell and asked for a contribution. She said for what. He said for him. She said to what end. He looked at her blankly and asked for a contribution. She asked him to leave the porch. He asked for a contribution. Somewhere, he’d got the idea that, when asking for a contribution, one angled to sit on the couch. He started in, and she pushed him back with a thick forearm. Down the front steps he went, ringing the iron bannister with his massive head.</p><p>He got up and staggered away, a little blood on his scalp.</p><p>“Learn to leave people be!” Poltoi shouted after him.</p><p>Ten minutes later, Eddie, Sr., stood on Poltoi’s porch, a hulking effeminate tailor too cowed to use his bulk for anything but butting open the jamming door at his shop.</p><p>“Since when has it become the sport to knock unfortunates down stairs?” he asked.</p><p>“He was not listen,” she said. “I tell him no. He try to come inside.”</p><p>“With all respect,” he said, “it is in my son’s nature to perhaps be not so responsive.”</p><p>“Someone so unresponse, keep him indoors,” she said. “He is big as a man. And I am old lady.”</p><p>“Never has Eddie presented a danger to anyone,” Eddie, Sr., said.</p><p>“I know my rights,” she said. “Next time, I call police.”</p><p>But, having been pushed down the stairs, Eddie the Vacant couldn’t seem to stay away.</p><p>“Off this porch,” Poltoi said through the screen when he showed up the next day, offering her an empty cold-cream jar for three dollars.</p><p>“We gone have so many snacks,” he said. “And if I drink a alcohol drink, then watch out. Because I ain’t allowed. I dance too fast.”</p><p>He was trying the doorknob now, showing how fast he would dance if alcohol was served.</p><p>“Please, off this porch!” she shouted.</p><p>“Please, off this porch!” he shouted back, doubling at the waist in wacky laughter.</p><p>Poltoi called the cops. Normally, Lieutenant Brusci would have asked Eddie what bird was in effect that day and given him a ride home in his squad. But this was during the OneCity fiasco. To cut graft, cops were being yanked off their regular beats and replaced by cops from other parts of town. A couple of Armenians from South Shore showed up and dragged Eddie off the porch in a club lock so tight he claimed the birds he was seeing were beakless.</p><p>“I’ll give you a beak, Frankenstein,” said one of the Armenians, tightening the choke hold.</p><p>Eddie entered the squad with all the fluidity of a hatrack. Art and Raccoon and I ran over to Eddie, Sr.,’s tailor shop, above the Marquee, which had sunk to porn. When Eddie, Sr., saw us, he stopped his Singer by kicking out the plug. From downstairs came a series of erotic moans.</p><p>Eddie, Sr., rushed to the hospital with his Purple Heart and some photos of Eddie as a grinning, wet-chinned kid on a pony. He found Eddie handcuffed to a bed, with an I.V. drip and a smashed face. Apparently, he’d bitten one of the Armenians. Bail was set at three hundred. The tailor shop made zilch. Eddie, Sr.,’s fabrics were a lexicon of yesteryear. Dust coated a bright-yellow sign that read “Zippers Repaired in Jiffy.”</p><p>“Jail for that kid, I admit, don’t make total sense,” the judge said. “Three months in the Anston. Best I can do.”</p><p>The Anston Center for Youth was a red brick former forge now yarded in barbed wire. After their shifts, the guards held loud, hooting orgies kitty-corner at Zem’s Lamplighter. Skinny immigrant women arrived at Zem’s in station wagons and emerged hours later adjusting their stockings. From all over Chicago kids were sent to the Anston, kids who’d only ever been praised for the level of beatings they gave and received and their willingness to carve themselves up. One Anston kid had famously hired another kid to run over his foot. Another had killed his mother’s lover with a can opener. A third had sliced open his own eyelid with a pop-top on a dare.</p><p>Eddie the Vacant disappeared into the Anston in January and came out in March.</p><p>To welcome him home, Eddie, Sr., had the neighborhood kids over. Eddie the<span data-page="page_3"></span> Vacant looked so bad even the Kletzes didn’t joke about how bad he looked. His nose was off center and a scald mark ran from ear to chin. When you got too close, his hands shot up. When the cake was served, he dropped his plate, shouting, “Leave a guy alone!”</p><p>Our natural meanness now found a purpose. Led by the Kletzes, we cut through Poltoi’s hose, bashed out her basement windows with ball-peens, pushed her little shopping cart over the edge of the quarry and watched it end-over-end into the former Slag Ravine.</p><p>Then it was spring and the quarry got busy. When the noon blast went off, our windows rattled. The three-o’clock blast was even bigger. Raccoon and Art and I made a fort from the cardboard shipping containers the Cline frames came in. One day, while pretending the three-o’clock blast was atomic, we saw Eddie the Vacant bounding toward our fort through the weeds, like some lover in a commercial, only fatter and falling occasionally.</p><p>His trauma had made us kinder toward him.</p><p>“Eddie,” Art said. “You tell your dad where you’re at?”</p><p>“It no big problem,” Eddie said. “I was gone leave my dad a note.”</p><p>“But did you?” said Art.</p><p>“I’ll leave him a note when I get back,” said Eddie. “I gone come in with you now.”</p><p>“No room,” said Raccoon. “You’re too huge.”</p><p>“That a good one!” said Eddie, crowding in.</p><p>Down in the quarry were the sad cats, the slumping watchman’s shack, the piles of reddish, discarded dynamite wrappings that occasionally rose erratically up the hillside like startled birds.</p><p>Along the quarryside trail came Mrs. Poltoi, dragging a new shopping cart.</p><p>“Look at that pig,” said Raccoon. “Eddie, that’s the pig that put you away.”</p><p>“What did they do to you in there, Ed?” said Art. “Did they mess with you?”</p><p>“No, they didn’t,” said Eddie. “I just a say to them, ‘Leave a guy alone!’ I mean, sometime they did, O.K.? Sometime that one guy say, ‘Hey, Eddie, pull your thing! We gone watch you.’ ”</p><p>“O.K., O.K.,” said Art.</p><p>At dusk, the three of us would go to Mrs. H.’s porch. She’d bring out cookies and urge forgiveness. It wasn’t Poltoi’s fault her heart was small, she told us. She, Mrs. H., had seen a great number of things, and seeing so many things had enlarged her heart. Once, she had seen Göring. Once, she had seen Einstein. Once, during the war, she had seen a whole city block, formerly thick with furriers, bombed black overnight. In the morning, charred bodies had crawled along the street, begging for mercy. One such body had grabbed her by the ankle, and she recognized it as Bergen, a friend of her father’s.</p><p>“What did you do?” said Raccoon.</p><p>“Not important now,” said Mrs. H., gulping back tears, looking off into the quarry.</p><p>Then disaster. Dad got a check for shoulder pads for all six district football teams and, trying to work things out with Mom, decided to take her on a cruise to Jamaica. Nobody in our neighborhood had ever been on a cruise. Nobody had even been to Wisconsin. The disaster was, I was staying with Poltoi. Ours was a liquor household, where you could ask a question over and over in utter sincerity and never get a straight answer. I asked and asked, “Why her?” And was told and told, “It will be an adventure.”</p><p>I asked, “Why not Grammy?”</p><p>I was told, “Grammy don’t feel well.”</p><p>I asked, “Why not Hopanlitski?”</p><p>Dad did this like snort.</p><p>“Like that’s gonna happen,” said Mom.</p><p>“Why not, why not?” I kept asking.</p><p>“Because shut up,” they kept answering.</p><p>Just after Easter, over I went, with my little green suitcase.</p><p>I was a night panicker and occasional bed-wetter. I’d wake drenched and panting. Had they told her? I doubted it. Then I knew they hadn’t, from the look on her face the first night, when I peed myself and woke up screaming.</p><p>“What’s this?” she said.</p><p>“Pee,” I said, humiliated beyond any ability to lie.</p><p>“Ach, well,” she said. “Who don’t? This also used to be me. Pee pee pee. I used to dream of a fish who cursed me.”</p><p>She changed the sheets gently, with no petulance—a new one on me. Often Ma, still half asleep, popped me with the wet sheet, saying when at last I had a wife, she herself could finally get some freaking sleep.</p><p>Then the bed was ready, and Poltoi made a sweeping gesture, like, Please.</p><p>I got in.</p><p>She stayed standing there.</p><p>“You know,” she said. “I know they say things. About me, what I done to that boy. But I had a bad time in the past with a big stupid boy. You don’t gotta know. But I did like I did that day for good reason. I was scared at him, due to something what happened for real to me.”</p><p>She stood in the half-light, looking down at her feet.</p><p>“Do you get?” she said. “Do you? Can you get it, what I am saying?”</p><p>“I think so,” I said.</p><p>“Tell to him,” she said. “Tell to him sorry, explain about it, tell your friends also. If you please. You have a good brain. That is why I am saying to you.”</p><p>Something in me rose to this. I’d never heard it before but I<span data-page="page_final"></span> believed it: I had a good brain. I could be trusted to effect a change.</p><p>Next day was Saturday. She made soup. We played a game using three slivers of soap. We made placemats out of colored strips of paper, and she let me teach her my spelling words.</p><p>Around noon, the doorbell rang. At the door stood Mrs. H.</p><p>“Everything O.K.?” she said, poking her head in.</p><p>“Yes, fine,” said Poltoi. “I did not eat him yet.”</p><p>“Is everything really fine?” Mrs. H. said to me. “You can say.”</p><p>“It’s fine,” I said.</p><p>“You can say,” she said fiercely.</p><p>Then she gave Poltoi a look that seemed to say, Hurt him and you will deal with me.</p><p>“You silly woman,” said Poltoi. “You are going now.”</p><p>Mrs. H. went.</p><p>We resumed our spelling. It was tense in a quiet-house way. Things ticked. When Poltoi missed a word, she pinched her own hand, but not hard. It was like symbolic pinching. Once when she pinched, she looked at me looking at her, and we laughed.</p><p>Then we were quiet again.</p><p>“That lady?” she finally said. “She like to lie. Maybe you don’t know. She say she is come from where I come from?”</p><p>“Yes,” I said.</p><p>“She is lie,” she said. “She act so sweet and everything but she lie. She been born in Skokie. Live here all her life, in America. Why you think she talk so good?”</p><p>All week, Poltoi made sausage, noodles, potato pancakes; we ate like pigs. She had tea and cakes ready when I came home from school. At night, if necessary, she dried me off, moved me to her bed, changed the sheets, put me back, with never an unkind word.</p><p>“Will pass, will pass,” she’d hum.</p><p>Mom and Dad came home tanned, with a sailor cap for me, and, in a burst of post-vacation honesty, confirmed it: Mrs. H. was a liar. A liar and a kook. Nothing she said was true. She’d been a cashier at Goldblatt’s but had been caught stealing. When caught stealing, she’d claimed to be with the Main Office. When a guy from the Main Office came down, she’d claimed to be with the F.B.I. Then she’d produced a letter from Lady Bird Johnson, but in her own handwriting, with “Johnson” spelled “Jonsen.”</p><p>I told the other kids what I knew, and in time they came to believe it, even the Kletzes.</p><p>And, once we believed it, we couldn’t imagine we hadn’t seen it all along.</p><p>Another spring came, once again birds nested in bushes on the sides of the quarry. A thrown rock excited a thrilling upward explosion. Thin rivers originated in our swampy back yards, and we sailed boats made of flattened shoeboxes, Twinkie wrappers, crimped tinfoil. Raccoon glued together three balsa-wood planes and placed on this boat a turd from her dog, Svengooli, and, as Svengooli’s turd went over a little waterfall and disappeared into the quarry, we cheered. ♦</p>	George Saunders	January 19, 2004 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/01/19/bohemians	Chicago	Children	Frauds	Jews	Liars	Widows	Unnamed	First	Children
Buttony	<p>The <span data-page="page_1"></span>children wanted to play Buttony.</p><p>“All right,” Miss Lewis said, and she clapped her hands five times, in the rhythm that meant they must be quiet and copy her. They were quiet and copied her.</p><p>“All right,” she said, with that smile she reserved for the sleepy, silly midafternoon. “We’ll play. Joseph, get the button.” The children approved the justice of this appointment; that was apparent in the small, satisfied sigh they made together. They watched Joseph walk to Miss Lewis’s desk. Joseph was a compact, deliberate boy, and his straight black hair fell to his shoulders. He wore his uniform in a way that seemed gentlemanly but at the same time casual. He was both kind and beautiful, and they loved him.</p><p>The button lay in a special tin in the right-hand corner of Miss Lewis’s top drawer. The children listened for the sound this drawer made as Joseph opened it. They knew that the shifting sound of the drawer opening meant largesse—gold stars or stamps or, in exceptional cases, gummy frogs—and that Miss Lewis’s bounty was capable of falling on them all, but fell perhaps more often on Joseph. Alternatively, the sound of the drawer opening meant Buttony.</p><p>All the children handled the button with reverence, but none more so than Joseph. He was gifted in solemnity. He had a processional walk and moved his head slowly when his name was called—and it was regularly called. His attention was made more valuable by its purposeful quality. He never leaned in confidentially to hear a secret; the other children came to his ear and whispered there. Miss Lewis liked to call on him in class just to see his measured face rise up out of that extraordinary hair. His beauty had startled her, until she’d met both parents—Vietnamese mother, Polish father—and then he’d seemed like the solution to something. When he held the yellow button out before him in the dish of his hands, Miss Lewis could forget the mustard-colored cardigan it had fallen off one winter day. The button was no longer limited by its cheap yellow plastic; it seemed to pulse with life. The children looked at it, and at Joseph, without appearing to breathe. Miss Lewis wanted her children to live in a heightened way, and she encouraged this sort of ceremony.</p><p>“Close the drawer, Joseph,” she said, because she found she liked nothing better, after admiring him, after giving him the opportunity to be admired, than to gently suggest a mundane task. Miss Lewis could close that drawer with her hip. Joseph used a shoulder. The sound of the drawer closing released the children. Now they hurried to line up at the door.</p><p>They always played Buttony outside.</p><p>“Quietly, quietly!” Miss Lewis scolded, brushing the tops of their heads as they filed past her into the corridor, led by Joseph and the button. She followed them out. In the next-door classroom, 3A recited times tables under the priestly monotone of Mr. Graham. The other side of the corridor shone with 5B’s scaled depiction of the solar system. The children claimed to like blue Saturn best, with its luminous rings, but Miss Lewis was fond of Neptune. She always put out a finger to touch its smooth crayon surface as she passed.</p><p>They gathered under the jacaranda tree. The day was sweet and green. Miss Lewis leaned against the tree and crossed one ankle over the other. Her ankles were still slim; she wasn’t so very old. The children formed a circle around Joseph, and there was something very natural about this, about Joseph being in the middle of a circle. Grave Joseph. He stood with the button as if at some kind of memorial service. Then he raised it to his lips and kissed it. No one had ever kissed the button before, and some of the other children raised their fingers to their lips. Miss Lewis pursed her mouth. One boy—she didn’t see who—let out a brief scoff, but was ignored.</p><p>“Put out your hands,” Miss Lewis said, and the children lifted their cupped hands.</p><p>“Close your eyes,” Miss Lewis said, closing her own eyes. She was often so tired, in the midafternoon, that this handful of seconds in which to close her eyes seemed the true blessing of Buttony. To stand under the jacaranda tree in the bright day and make darkness fall, and then to hear Joseph’s voice. His eyes were open, of course. He made his way around the circle, and as he touched each set of hands he said, “Buttony.”</p><p>“Buttony, Buttony,” twenty-one times. Miss Lewis counted them out, and when he was finished—all twenty-one pairs of hands, because none of her children were absent that day, no one was sick or pretending to be—she opened her eyes. The children stood motionless in the circle, and now their hands were closed, each set clasped together, possibly holding the button. Joseph returned to the middle of the circle. He looked up at Miss Lewis and she looked at him, and it was as if, from inside that hair, he were acknowledging sorrow and solitude and fatigue, and also routine and expectation and quietness. And, because he was only a boy, trust. Miss Lewis nodded, and Joseph nodded back.</p><p>“Open your eyes,” Miss Lewis said. She loved to see all her children open their eyes at once. They always smiled,<span data-page="page_2"></span> as if relieved to see the light on the other side of their eyelids. They giggled and pressed their hands together, and looked at one another’s hands, and looked at Joseph, and wondered who now had the button. Oh, that beautiful button: mustard-colored, Joseph-kissed. Round as a planet on one side, sharp as a kiss on the other. Joseph stood with his hands behind his back. His hair hung over his eyes. It was hard to puzzle Joseph out in Buttony. The children delayed for a fond moment, as if wanting to leave him alone with his secret a little longer. Miss Lewis surveyed the circle to see who was blushing, whose head was raised higher than usual, who was smiling at having been favored with the button. She also looked for the disconsolate signs of a child who was clearly buttonless.</p><p>“You start, Miranda,” Miss Lewis said.</p><p>Miranda rubbed her right ear against her right shoulder. She swayed on one leg.</p><p>“Xin,” she said. Xin produced a goofy smile. Then she opened her hands: there was no button there.</p><p>“Blake,” Xin said. Blake grinned and threw his empty hands over his head.</p><p>Blake said Miranda. Miranda said Josie. Josie said Osea. Osea said Ramon. Miss Lewis closed her eyes. She opened them again and thought, Jyoti. It took eleven more children to guess Jyoti. She was one of those girls you didn’t suspect. Her socks slipped. She had a mole on her left cheek. It was like Joseph to have picked Jyoti. It was like Jyoti to stand burning invisibly in the circle, hardly able to believe her luck. Her hands unfolded, and there was the button. The other children craned to look. For a moment, they loved her. For a moment, she held Joseph’s kiss in her hands. She stepped into the middle of the circle, and Joseph took her place. She raised the button to her lips, but didn’t kiss it.</p><p>“Hands out, eyes closed,” Miss Lewis said, and darkness fell. “Don’t forget, Jyoti. No giving the button to the person who was just it. Don’t give the button to Joseph.”</p><p>It was necessary to remind the children of this rule at the beginning of every game; otherwise, they were capable of handing the button over to Joseph at any opportunity. As it was, Jyoti picked Archie, and Archie picked Joseph. Joseph picked Mimi, who picked Miranda, who picked Joseph.</p><p>The afternoon grew brighter. Planes flew overhead in all directions. The jacaranda dropped its spring flowers. Every now and then, Miss Lewis saw faces at the windows of classrooms, as other children looked out to see them playing Buttony. How long had they been playing now? These children could spend the whole afternoon hoping to be chosen by Joseph. They would never tire of it. Joseph picked Ruby picked Ramon picked Joseph picked Liam S. picked Liam M. picked Joseph. Joseph said, “Buttony, Buttony, Buttony” twenty-one times. Miss Lewis closed her eyes and kept them closed when she said, “Open your eyes.” The children, in turn, said, “Buttony, Buttony, Buttony.” She uncrossed her ankles and crossed them again and thought, Every day could pass like this, quite easily. Every day could be sweet and green with the jacaranda and the children and the sun and the planes. And then, at the end of them all, the sweet days and the children, would you open your eyes? Would your hands fall open?</p><p>Would they be empty?</p><p>Miss Lewis looked. Joseph stood in the circle.</p><p>“Hands out, close your eyes,” she said, and the children obeyed. They bent their heads as if praying. She was moved by the tenderness she saw come over each of them. They were like children in a fairy tale, under a spell.</p><p>She looked at Joseph, and he was watching her, so she nodded at him. His face was impassive. He made her think of a Swiss Guard at the Vatican. He received her nod by beginning to walk around the circle, and each hand he touched trembled, and the children lowered their heads still further as he passed them. Their hands closed like sea anemones. Joseph hadn’t yet given away the button. Fifteen, nineteen, twenty-one times he said, “Buttony.” Then he raised his neutral face and looked at Miss Lewis and opened his mouth and placed the button inside it. The button made no indentation in his cheek. Miss Lewis crossed her arms. You will solve this, she thought, and suffer for it. Joseph blinked inside his hair.</p><p>“Open your eyes,” Miss Lewis said. The children lifted their heads into the burden of their love for Joseph. They smiled and squirmed and began to guess: Phoebe, Ruby, Usha, Archie, Blake. Joseph turned toward every name as it was called, as if waiting to see who might produce the button. Liam S., Bella, Jackson, Xin. Twenty names, and twenty hands falling open. Only Jyoti remained. She stood with her rigid hands, with her desperate smile, with her socks slipping. No one wanted to say her name. They wanted her to give herself up. Miss Lewis, too, wanted Jyoti to give herself up. Eventually, Ramon said, “Jyoti.” Jyoti opened her empty hands.</p><p>The circle laughed. Miss Lewis had found that children, as a rule, didn’t like practical jokes. There was a certain kind of laughter that, in children, was a howl. Ramon took Jyoti’s wrists<span data-page="page_final"></span> and inspected her hands. No one looked at Joseph, but they all saw Jyoti: the mole on her cheek, the dusty mark where she’d rubbed her shin with the heel of her shoe, the crookedness of her teeth. Jyoti might have been crying. Ramon threw her wrists down as if discarding them. Then all the children save Joseph and Jyoti began to cry out, just as they’d done when they wanted to play Buttony. They stamped their feet and kicked at the grass. They shook their uniforms and looked up into the branches of the jacaranda tree, as if they might find the button there. The circle broke open as they shook and kicked and shouted, and faces appeared again in classroom windows.</p><p>Miss Lewis watched Joseph stand there with his mouth closed and his hands behind his back. Although the circle had broken, he seemed still to be in the middle of it. He was only a boy, and he was alone and proud and terrible. Miss Lewis stepped away from the tree. She would order him to open his mouth and spit out the button. She would make him say what he had done, how he had stood and watched the children guess; she would shame him, and the faces in the windows would see it. But first she must settle the children. She clapped her hands five times in the rhythm that meant they must be quiet and copy her. They were quiet, but they didn’t copy her. She saw the way they looked at her; she saw their fury.</p><p>Ramon came first, to pull at her pockets. Then Josie, who had lost a tooth that morning; her mouth was open as she searched the grass at Miss Lewis’s feet. Osea and Mimi scratched at the scabbed bark of the tree. Miss Lewis swatted and slapped, but the children still came. They opened her hands and dug in her elbows. Liam S. squatted to peer up her skirt, and when she crouched to stop him it was Jyoti who pulled the pins from her hair, as if the button might be hidden in its roots. Now Miss Lewis cried out. She lifted her head and saw 3A’s Mr. Graham running toward her. And Joseph was behind him, not quite running, not altogether, but like a shadow, long and blank and beautiful. ♦</p>	Fiona McFarlane	March 7, 2016 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/03/07/buttony	Buttons	Childhood	Children	Games	Schools	Teachers	Multiple	Third	Children
Chicken Hill	<p>She <span data-page="page_1"></span>didn’t know what had possessed her to participate in such a thing. A little boy had been run over by a sheriff’s deputy, and there was a memorial fund-raiser at the Barbed Wire, a biker bar in a somewhat alarming part of town, and Ruth had gone and bought a beer and put thirty dollars into an empty terrarium, for funeral expenses. The place was loud and crowded, and she was given a plate with a tamale on it. Outside, someone had brought a pony and was providing pony rides for the dead boy’s friends. No one spoke to her directly, but she learned that the boy’s name was Hector and that his father was suing the sheriff’s department.</p><p>Good, Ruth thought.</p><p>But Hector’s death, it seemed, was Hector’s fault. He had run into the street against the light. His fault, against the light—the details were so paltry. Ruth could have told Hector’s father that he would find no satisfaction with his lawsuit, but she never returned to the Barbed Wire, where she might have found him, to express this belief. It was a tough little place. Going there had been one of the last journeys she had taken, though, of course, she did not know this at the time. It had been difficult to find. The closer she got to it the more frequently she’d had to ask for directions. People had assumed that she was looking for something else and had not been as helpful as they might have been.</p><p>[audio url="https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/222346035"]</p><p>None of Ruth’s friends knew about her excursion to the little fellow’s memorial, which, Ruth had to remind herself, had been scarcely a memorial at all but a fund-raiser, which she had respectfully participated in, though why she had given the curious amount of thirty dollars was a puzzle. It was probably all she’d had in her purse at the time—all she ever seemed to have in her purse. No one had spoken on behalf of the boy, and there hadn’t been a single photograph of him there, not even a duplicate of the poor one that had appeared in the newspaper, cropped from a group of people, it seemed, his little face shaded by a preposterously large cowboy hat and quite blurry.</p><p>It was probably just coincidence that a child appeared not long after that. This one, a girl, belonged to the doctor who lived nearby in a house painted a prominent aubergine. The house had once been invisible from Ruth’s veranda, or what she called her veranda, but the doctor had removed a stand of cottonwoods in order to install solar panels, and now she could make out a sliver of the sprawling place. The removal had been modestly controversial, but supporters of the doctor’s actions had argued that the trees were running on fumes, anyway, and, being as starved and delusional as they were, could be dangerous. She supposed the fools were talking about memory—the trees’ memory of some water source that had now dried up.</p><p>Greetings between Ruth and the child had never been exchanged before. Nor were they now, exactly.</p><p>It was a hot day, as all the days were, and Ruth was on her veranda, eating a tuna-fish sandwich. She seldom ate tuna-fish sandwiches, because she found them an uncomfortable physical experience. After a few swallows, she felt as if she were having a heart attack. There was the tightness in her chest, her esophagus constricting, resisting passage, her oppressive baffled alarm. It was as if the splendid and courageous giant of the oceans were rising up in horror, disputing what had been done to it, and why should it not. . . .</p><p>Putting the sandwich aside, Ruth took large gulps of air and then small ones, trying to restore order to her thrashing chest. The girl watched her gravely. Ruth suspected that she was there to request permission to play in the gully behind her house, which Ruth considered an attractive nuisance, though it was by no means attractive. Indeed, it was more like a ravine, a dark peculiarity, than a gully. But the child did not request permission, which Ruth wouldn’t have granted anyway.</p><p>Instead she said, “I would like to draw you in plein air_._”</p><p>“No, thanks,” Ruth said.</p><p>“Do you have dogs?”</p><p>“I do.”</p><p>“May I see them?”</p><p>“No,” Ruth said.</p><p>“You used to have dogs. To reassure you, I could show you some work I’ve done in the past.”</p><p>She was not an appealing child, but she didn’t seem mentally deficient or malformed, either. Still, she was something of a runt, made more runtlike by the enormous backpack she wore. From this pink, somewhat smelly apparatus she extracted several pieces of construction paper.</p><p>“These aren’t good at all!” Ruth exclaimed. She was sincerely dismayed.</p><p>“I’m just beginning,” the child said. “I should be encouraged.”</p><p>“Not by me, I’m afraid,” Ruth said.</p><p>“Do you give blood?”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“Do you ever give blood?”</p><p>“No,” Ruth said.</p><p>“You should. Only thirty-eight per cent of the population is eligible to give blood, and only eight per cent of them actually donate. The need for blood is constant and ongoing.”</p><p>“Maybe I’m not eligible.”</p><p>“I bet you are. You probably are.”</p><p>“I’m old. I need my blood.”</p><p>Was this what they talked about at the doctor’s house—blood? And the efficient avidity of those<span data-page="page_2"></span> hideous solar slabs?</p><p>Ruth had no children but many friends. Or she thought she had many friends. They stood up pretty well to her requirements, but sometimes they didn’t. Actually, she could probably count fewer friends now than she’d had even a year ago.</p><p>As for children, though her experience with them was limited, this one here seemed a doozy. She wondered if the girl had ever encountered little Hector, but quickly dismissed the possibility. The two travelled in different circles, lived in separate worlds, the doctor’s daughter and the felon’s son—for it had been disclosed that Hector’s father had a rap sheet as long as your arm, though he hadn’t done anything recently.</p><p>That backpack needed to be washed and thoroughly aired. “Would you like some of my old jewelry to play with?” Ruth surprised herself by saying.</p><p>“I guess,” the child said.</p><p>“You go away now, and when you come back in a few months, say, I’ll give you some jewelry.”</p><p>“I’ll come back tomorrow.”</p><p>“That’s so soon!” Ruth protested. “But all right. The day after tomorrow. The important thing is to go away now.”</p><p>Ruth retreated inside and watched the child trudge back to the aubergine house, the sliver of which was so unpleasantly visible. The backpack all but eclipsed her. It must be quite heavy, Ruth thought, or something.</p><p>When the child appeared again, Ruth was back on her veranda, staring without much interest at her right hand, which had recently completed a letter of condolence to her mechanic’s widow. As a rule, the mechanic had not accepted Toyotas, but he had made an exception for Ruth, and though he had worked on her car with some indifference and disdain, he’d kept it running, and at a fair price. People were dying right and left around Ruth. Death was picking up the pace. Two poets she had never met but read with great pleasure were taken on the same day. Her pedicurist had died, and what would Ruth do without her unjudgmental services? It was so easy to let oneself go.</p><p>“You’re here for the jewelry, I suppose,” Ruth said.</p><p>“I’d forgotten about the jewelry. But O.K.”</p><p>Ruth had actually gone through her jewelry some time ago, but she was still amazed at how much of it she had. She could remember the provenance of only a fraction of it.</p><p>“Provenance,” the girl said. “That’s an interesting word. What does it mean?”</p><p>Ruth wasn’t aware that she had uttered the word aloud, though there was no reason not to, it being a perfectly benign word.</p><p>The child was paler than Ruth remembered and scrawnier than ever. The pink backpack could quite possibly weigh more than she did.</p><p>“Do you really need that thing?” Ruth inquired. “Doesn’t your mother ever wash it?”</p><p>“The doctor?”</p><p>Ruth supposed her own question had been merely rhetorical.</p><p>“Bring it up here, take everything out of it, and I’ll scrub it with a good bar of soap.” The thought of some of her jewelry (for she had no intention of giving the girl all of it) being lowered into that stinking sack prompted her to action. Also, she was curious as to what could be in the massive thing.</p><p>The child hopped up the steps, unstrapped herself, and began unzipping the backpack’s numerous pockets. This took some time.</p><p>There was nothing. It held nothing. [cartoon id="a19420"]</p><p>Ruth decided that she didn’t want to tackle the problem with a good bar of soap. It was all right. Whatever. Sometimes you try to fix something and it ends up more broken than ever. Or broken in a different way.</p><p>“You don’t even have your drawings in there. What happened to your drawings?”</p><p>“I decided that was the wrong approach. What would you say your discomfort level is right now, on a scale of one to ten? One being your most comfortable or least discomfortable, of course.”</p><p>“I’m quite comfortable, thank you,” Ruth said.</p><p>“Mine’s around a six.”</p><p>“To be honest, perhaps mine as well.”</p><p>Neither chose to elaborate on these disclosures.</p><p>A little breeze wound past them. Ruth remembered that breeze and was always grateful when it reappeared. The veranda was somewhat oppressive and in need of paint. Portions of the floor had rotted through, and you had to stay away from those.</p><p>“Can I see your dogs?”</p><p>“Not today,” Ruth said.</p><p>“Thomas Aquinas said that friendship between humans and animals is impossible.”</p><p>“That’s idiotic. I’ve never heard of anything more ridiculous.”</p><p>“What could he have been thinking, right?” The child was hunched into her backpack again. “Once you’re dead, you shouldn’t be read.”</p><p>“Well, I wouldn’t go that far,” Ruth said.</p><p>“I have brothers and sisters, you know. A whole mess of them.”</p><p>“Really? I haven’t been aware of them. I mean, I haven’t seen them.”</p><p>“Just me.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“You’ve just seen me.”</p><p>“Yes,” Ruth said.</p><p>Ruth thought she’d walk up to the doctor’s house. Take a good look. Figure this thing out. Get to the bottom of it. She dressed as well as she could, for the weather was every which way; it was hard to know. First dry and hot, then such humidity that it was difficult to breathe. She selected a skirt and blouse, a sweater. Her closet was stuffed with things she hadn’t put on in years. She pulled out a pair of shoes that were velvety<span data-page="page_3"></span> with mildew. One more wear and then out they’d go, she decided.</p><p>She ate a bowl of cereal. The milk had gone bad. Sometimes the refrigerator took pride in keeping things cool and crisp and sometimes it didn’t seem to care.</p><p>She began cautiously. The way was slippery, greasy almost, and tipped upward toward the aubergine house. The solar panels lay there, ruthless and withholding. The house was silent and looked pretty much the way it always had to Ruth. She hadn’t really examined it before, but scrutiny afforded her nothing new. Other than its perplexing color and the depressing row of stumps on its southern border it was unexceptional. The child did not appear; nor did any “mess” of others—not that Ruth would have been surprised if she were told by a responsible party that they didn’t exist. The girl was prone to enlarge on the truth, and her knowledge was exaggeratedly spotty, certainly.</p><p>Ruth tried to think of herself at that age. It was winter, and she was sliding down Chicken Hill on a piece of cardboard. No one had real sleds with runners. Everyone had a piece of cardboard. It was called Chicken Hill because it ended at the road. You had to know what you were doing. She’d been a far more robust child than this one, and not as humorless or demanding. Though the girl was demanding only of her time so far, which wasn’t much or was everything, depending on how you looked at it.</p><p>Chicken Hill, Chicken Hill, what a place! The world! She could feel the purity of its cold core and see the slick ice shining. Her sled had once been a carton that held gallon jugs of maple syrup. It was so strong—the finest, fastest board on Chicken Hill. . . .</p><p>The sounds of children laughing and screaming faded, and she found herself standing dumbly before the doctor’s house, which exhibited no sign of life whatsoever. She turned and made her way down the street again to her own unkempt home. She saw this clearly: the place needed some fluffing up. But she had five dogs—there was a lot of wear and tear. More than five would have brought her to the attention of the authorities. “Keep the authorities at bay as long as you are able” was her motto. On the steps she paused and kicked off the foul shoes. She opened the door, hoping the dogs wouldn’t knock her over in ecstatic greeting. They had no idea of their size and were always so glad to see her.</p><p>But the dogs were not there. They had vanished as though they’d never been, along with their bowls and beds. That last detail, that their belongings were gone, too, gave her hope that, despite appearances, a cruelty had not occurred.</p><p>Naturally, Ruth was heartbroken. She loved her dogs. If such a thing could happen, anything could happen. Someone might suggest that she had not had the dogs at the same time—after all, five was a lot to handle at her age, and they’d been big dogs, too—but had a succession of dogs over the years. But that would have been mean and not helpful in the least.</p><p>You can’t live a life that’s no longer your own.</p><p>Which was a truth that surely didn’t apply only to her, for many must feel they are living lives that they no longer inhabit, just as sometimes the tears you shed seem to come from the eyes of another.</p><p>Ruth was concerned that the child would ask to see the dogs, as she usually did, but she did not. Of course, Ruth could have said “No” or “Not today” once again, but it wouldn’t have been the same.</p><p>“One of my classmates died,” the girl announced. “She was in my grade at school.”</p><p>“And what grade is that?” Ruth asked, quite irrelevantly, she knew. Her voice had become faint with disuse. If it hadn’t been for the child’s visits she might have lost it altogether, and the visits were becoming less reliable. Their connection was wavering; Ruth could feel it.</p><p>“The second. She had a rare form of cancer. They said they’d never seen such a cancer before, behaving the way it did.”</p><p>“Oh, they’re always saying that,” Ruth said impatiently.</p><p>“So many people came to her funeral. You’d think she’d taken a bullet for a senator or something.”</p><p>“You must be sad. It’s quite sad.”</p><p>“I know,” the girl said piously.</p><p>“Death’s got the bit in her teeth these days, I’d say.”</p><p>Ruth saw it then suddenly, as she would a picture, her horse, Abdiel. She would ride him on Chicken Hill in the summer, when the grass was high and smelled so sweet—grass could no longer smell as sweet. He was a big horse, probably too big for Ruth as a child, but they seemed to have an understanding, the two of them. Abdiel. Her mother and father had named him for the angel in “Paradise Lost”—“faithful found, / Among the faithless, faithful only he.”</p><p>They had loved books; their house was full of books, all in other hands now, or worse, the books and pictures and animals. Ruth hadn’t been much of a reader herself. As a child, she’d wanted to possess herself, only herself. This was her duty. Yet she was aware that any moment could take<span data-page="page_final"></span> away the assurance that this was possible. Her mother and father had not been very sensible. They were bohemians, romantics, clever and hungry and bright, believers in the wild freedoms that life bestows and which time and death are so eager to unsustain.</p><p>Her father had said that Abdiel looked like Tolstoy’s horse, the one in the famous photograph, black and spirited, his gleaming flesh forever rippling and shuddering, as though grazed by an unseen hand, as they galloped on Chicken Hill—Chicken Hill, what a place! The world!</p><p>“I believe,” the girl said, “and it saddens me to say this, but I believe we’ve come to the end of our options here.”</p><p>“Have I told you about the horse, my horse, Abdiel?”</p><p>“You have,” the girl said.</p><p>“Oh my, I did? Because I haven’t thought about him in ever so long. And he was so real, such a living force, my determinant.”</p><p>“Quite real,” the child agreed. “He was the last real thing, I think.”</p><p>“Not a piece of harmless cardboard, not a scrap of my imagining.”</p><p>“Imagination only fails us in the end, when the stories we tell ourselves have to stop. You don’t mind me saying that I’m going, do you? The doctor’s packing us all up. We’re going away.”</p><p>“Where?” Ruth managed, but she didn’t hear her voice saying anything. Her voice had nothing to say.</p><p>“Who knows? No one tells me anything.”</p><p>Ruth was almost happy, getting to the bottom of it, for she felt that she had. The corners of her poor veranda were dissolving into shadow. She didn’t see the child leave her. She didn’t even see herself leaving, having just, at last, gone. ♦</p>	Joy Williams	September 14, 2015 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/chicken-hill	Aging	Books	Children	Dementia	Dogs	Fantasies	Ruth	Third	Children
Choking Victim	<p>When she was younger she could be alone for weeks and never realize that it was time to miss another person, time to call another person on the phone. Now she found herself missing anybody she could think of. Nobody had warned her that watching her husband hold her baby with such care, their faces wordlessly opened to each other in admiration, would make her feel so alone. Day after day she climbed the staircase up to the bed and lay on her side, her gut and womb positioned directly above the space where the two of them usually took their alone time together. They might be in love with each other, but her body was the causal link. Mentally she was older than ever, as tired in the morning as if it were the end of the day, but this longing for others was a smooth pink patch where she felt as raw as a child.</p><p>Her name was Karen and she was thirty-two years old, but she had a much younger face. She had hair to her shoulders and a body like a girl’s, with knobby joints. When she pushed her baby through the park in a bulky red stroller, people watched her with curiosity and pity. In her plain but adultlike clothes she looked like a teen-age nanny, someone from another country who was underpaid and exploited. She was always being mistaken for a foreigner.</p><p>For the next two weeks her husband would be in China, supervising the construction of a government library that was being built over the local river. Once the building was completed, the most beautiful and formerly accessible part of the river would be hidden from the view of ordinary citizens. She felt lonelier without him around, but while he was away she could have her own alone time with her daughter. In the hot span of sunlight on the sofa, she drew the soft baby toward her. She rested the baby’s small, heavy body on her lap and held her head in the cup of one hand. She examined the baby’s face, an abbreviation of her own. But where the eye area and the mouth area met was a strange new nose, unlike any she had seen in her own family or her husband’s. They had named the baby Lila, a name that was impossible for an infant to inhabit, hoping that she would grow into it.</p><p>Dressed in lavender stripes, the baby looked up at her calmly and shut her mouth. By six months, infants were supposed to babble freely, but hers had said almost nothing. A traumatic or hostile home environment could obstruct an infant’s development, but Karen was confident that she and her husband weren’t guilty of that. They got along well, and when they fought it was in the style that he preferred—sentences clipped, reasonable but with a harsh and colorless tone. There was nothing there that could harm a baby, Karen told herself, especially one that didn’t even understand words.</p><p>Karen and her husband had met when they were young and working in a bigger city. One of the best things about him was his face, which was handsome but not overly so. It was a healthy, normal face, and when you looked at it you could imagine the person it belonged to doing any number of harmless things—pedalling a stationary bicycle, assembling a sandwich, listening to music while driving a car. Just looking at his face was enough to make Karen feel that she had peered into every crevice of his personality. But when he was away for too long she found it difficult to remember how the different parts of his face fit together, even though they had been married for almost five years.</p><p>Outside the window, men walked past berating faceless, bodiless entities on their phones. Cars rolled by so slowly that she could hear the engine whine in the deep center of the machine. It was time to begin speaking to the baby, the parenting books warned. At all moments of the day she should be linking objects with the words that identified them. Without a steady stream of well-articulated adult speech, an infant might lag in its development. Her daughter would essentially remain an animal. Karen wanted to begin speaking a steady stream of well-articulated language to her baby, but it was difficult to articulate. Sometimes when she sat still and listened to the inside of her mind she became distracted by the sound of a gentle rushing, like water from a faucet.</p><p>From the neighboring apartment came a noisy coughing. The cougher was an unlikable retiree whom the neighbors referred to by his last name, Puldron. Each day she watched through the sighthole in her door as he shuffled over to her stack of mail on the entryway table to paw piece by piece through her bills and catalogues, his blunt fingers pinching and creasing the flimsy photos of stylish outdoor furniture. Sometimes she heard the sound of a page being ripped out and folded into a tight packet, and when she cross-referenced her mutilated catalogue with the one online she saw that hers was now missing an image of a picnic basket or an industrial-style upholstered coffee table with wheels. Was Puldron trying to keep her from buying those objects and putting<span data-page="page_2"></span> them in her home to make her family complete?</p><p>The coughing continued, louder and more urgent. It grew and solidified simultaneously, like a skyscraper seen from an approaching car. Again and again, Puldron emptied his throat of sound and Karen could hear the wet clutch of his throat tube. A muscular ‘gk’ shuddered at the edge of the sound, the snag of choking. He hacked at the thing trapped in him until she found herself standing up. She looked down at the small ears of her daughter, unavoidably open to the world, eagerly capturing the sounds of the choking man and turning them inward to shape her soft, growing mind.</p><p>The coughing turned to a wheeze, culminated in silence.</p><p>Karen went over to the wall and pressed her ear to it. Nothing stirred behind the white wall, no spasm of mouth or throat. It had only been a minute or two, or maybe a couple more, since the choking started. She bumped her elbow weakly against the wall, arms full of daughter. “Are you choking?” she shouted.</p><p>If it was true that the smallest unit of stimuli could have a formative effect, then listening to the death of her neighbor was bound to do horrible things to Lila. There could be pyromania, cutting, morbid fascination with death—teen-age perils that Karen could hardly believe she had experienced, in her own past. Thinking about this was like hearing a funny story about something you had done while drunk. The worst part was that she had already let it happen. Lila had heard the whole grisly soundtrack. Karen needed to show her something beautiful immediately—a swan, a fountain. She propped the baby on the sofa and went around the apartment grabbing things and throwing them into an oversized, floppy bag. She hung the bag on the stroller, buckled the little body into the seat. At the door she realized that she should have called an ambulance, so she took the phone from her pocket. It was too late, wasn’t it?</p><p>Karen pulled the door open to escape and found Puldron, alive, standing by the mail table. Her reaction was relief, then irritation. The damage to Lila’s psyche had already been done.</p><p>Puldron exhaled wetly and continued his work as she pushed by him. He didn’t move—there was plenty of room for the frantic woman to get by with her ugly stroller. He flipped the page, flipped the page again, until he found something workable. With small, fine movements he tugged at the paper, tearing the picture out along the crease. It was a complicated vase, asymmetrical and made of iron: an object with gravity.</p><p>While there was nothing exactly wrong with the park, there was not much right with it, either. The light-colored grass was brittle to the touch but between its tufts the earth was soft and muddy. Loose bands of teen-age boys and girls pawed one another, the girls letting out terrifying screams and then laughing at Karen when she turned to look at them. “That lady’s never seen someone have fun in her entire life,” one girl said. “She’s, like, I’m scared!” another girl shouted. As Karen shoved the ugly red stroller over the chalky path, she wondered what type of body language she was projecting. When she left the hospital with Lila it seemed as though she had stepped onto a different planet. People looked at her now only to get out of her way. If someone stopped to speak to her, linger on her, it was always a woman—a woman with advice on how to mother, a woman who wanted to know the baby’s name or age. She had emerged into a world made only of women, and although they used a friendly tone, they spoke to her as if to a new employee whose incompetence was guaranteed.</p><p>Karen was surprised to see herself push past the fountain she had intended to show Lila. But what would they do with the fountain, anyhow? Crouch alongside it, peer over its gray lip into the fake blue water at a smattering of pennies, twigs, the drifting body casings of insects. Lift the baby up and dangle her over the surface so that she could swipe at the dirty water with her hand. In a larger sense, all of this would be forgotten by the child almost as it was happening. Even now, as something inside her mother unspooled, Lila seemed unchanged. Her blue eyes reached eagerly for the green grass, the rough stones. Karen took Lila’s silence as license to continue on: the walk was loosening her, erasing the ugliness of Puldron’s mouth, the compacted feeling that came with being at home.</p><p>Instead of the fountain, she would take her baby to see the untamed water. But there was no real water in this city, Karen thought, water you could sink your body into to feel more alive. They left the park and passed the library, the grocery, an Italian restaurant that Karen hadn’t eaten at since she was in college, visiting a friend. They passed a bodega where a woman sat on a squat stool arranging attractive, bright-colored oranges so that they covered the misshapen, yellowing ones beneath.</p><p>The other mothers she knew were envious of Lila’s personality. She scored very well on the tests for head-turning, object memory, and facial recognition, which indicated<span data-page="page_3"></span> that she was in the process of developing a high I.Q.—but she rarely cried or complained, which allowed the other mothers to experience her as a being of pure adorability, a sponge for affection that asked nothing in return. But the daughter that Karen wanted was one who talked, who chattered, who would help her become more of a human being and remake the world for her through her own eyes. “I love you just like you are,” she said out loud.</p><p>In Karen’s grip the stroller’s handlebar was shaking, twisting left and right and left, as though there were someone holding on to the front of the stroller, pulling it. Lila’s soft white face began to crumple, and from its open center came a high wail as the contraption shook her body. Karen stopped to see what had gone wrong, and the apparatus tipped forward and drew a lazy arc in the air, moving slow and quick at the same time, making it look as if the baby were diving. By falling onto her knees and blindly thrusting her arms out, Karen was just able to keep Lila from hitting the sidewalk.</p><p>Karen looked at the stroller, at the child. The inside of her head felt slow with panic, and the sound of her daughter crying muffled her thoughts. A wheel had come off—she could see it a few yards back—and who knew where the piece that held it on had been lost. The stroller would have to be left behind; she couldn’t carry it and the baby both. At the same time, the stroller was so expensive that she knew she would have to come back for it. It had a chassis of feather-light, heat-resistant titanium, and its parts had been manufactured in Germany by a company that made some of the less important parts of airplanes. She and her husband had agreed that it was the best model, safe and firmly made. When she wheeled it around, with its geometric-patterned diaper bag and its plastic frame as shiny as a fast-food playground, she felt bumbling and cartoonish.</p><p>Karen gathered Lila, red with tears, in her arms and began walking. It was only a few moments later that she remembered to think of a place to go.</p><p>In the café in the neighborhood where people came mostly to shop, there were only two other customers: a young man on a laptop, his large head squeezed between headphones, and an older woman eating a salad who might have been a young grandmother. Karen ordered a hot tea and sat down at the table farthest from both of them. Her arms ached, and she had blisters where heel and instep met the straps of her sandals. She felt guilty. She didn’t want to go back for the stroller, but to buy a new one would confirm to her husband that she was unable to keep valuable objects in her possession. “Karen,” he’d said tenderly when she lost a good sweater that she’d just bought, “you’re a net with one big hole in it. Everything just slips through you.”</p><p>With her gaze fixed on an empty corner, Karen adopted the flat facial expression of someone reading, though she had nothing to look at. She slid off her shoes. She just wanted to drink the sweet, tepid tea and think of nothing. But out of the corner of her eye she saw the older woman watching her between brief, performative glances at a magazine. Karen looked over, and looked away again too late.</p><p>“Did you borrow that shirt from someone?” the older woman asked, smiling toothily and leaning toward Karen.</p><p>“No,” Karen said. It was her own shirt. Karen turned to Lila and pretended that she was doing something involving and important with her. Taking a corner of Lila’s soft yellow blanket, she dabbed the little face gently, over and over.</p><p>“Well, it’s very nice,” the voice said from behind her back.</p><p>Karen felt a tug on her sleeve and turned her head. The woman was next to her, and rubbing the fabric between her middle finger and her thumb. The shirt was too big; it was a cotton blend, covered in a garish print of lilies and strawberries. In fact, Karen hated this shirt.</p><p>“Thank you,” she said stiffly, holding still.</p><p>“Has she started to say her words yet?” the woman asked, indicating Lila with a point of her fork. She reached back to her table and brought forth her salad, stabbing at it with a plastic fork.</p><p>“It’s too early,” Karen admitted. “Too early for babbling, even.”</p><p>“It’s a lonely time. I know it. You two are together all day long, and there’s nobody even to say ‘Mm-hmm.’ ” The woman laughed.</p><p>Karen nodded slowly.</p><p>“I’m Linda. How old are you, honey?” Linda asked, holding out her hand.</p><p>“Thirty-two,” Karen answered, wiping her sweaty palm on her shorts and squeezing Linda’s outstretched hand for an instant. Linda smiled and nodded, as though she wasn’t surprised. In her green silk blouse and pink patterned scarf, she was either somebody who understood colors very well or someone who didn’t understand them at all.</p><p>“And you feel a million years old inside, am I right?” Linda smiled winningly, her teeth sharply white in the dim lighting. Linda reminded Karen of a TV mother, someone who always gave good<span data-page="page_4"></span> advice and probably had never been bored, anxious, or confused in her life.</p><p>“I don’t know,” Karen said. “I feel <em>strange</em>.”</p><p>“Well, don’t we all,” Linda said, and shrugged as a long, escalating cry began to break from the baby. “You live life one way for, what, thirty years, you’ve just finally, barely gotten used to the way life is and then bam!” Linda swiped her finger against Lila’s wailing mouth. Lila quieted instantly. “They tell you that you gotta start learning life all over again. Bam! Isn’t that right?” Linda winked at Karen, and wiped the front and back of her hand on a napkin.</p><p>“How did you <em>do</em> that?” Karen exclaimed, truly impressed.</p><p>“Oh, just an old family trick. Old, old trick,” Linda said, leaning in. “A teensy dab of butter on the lips. Tamps them down like lambs.”</p><p>Linda was different from other mothers Karen had met: when she gave advice, it wasn’t stuffy. She was full of stories. For every frustration Karen named, Linda knew someone who had in fact gone through just that problem. Linda was a sort of freelance psychoanalyst, consultant, therapist, whatever you please. Diverse but well-respected people, she said, had sought her services for issues ranging from their child’s learning disability to what type of second career they should take on. She had just got these great new business cards printed on a hundred-per-cent-cotton paper, the real thing, only she didn’t have any with her today.</p><p>As for Karen, what she was dealing with was completely natural. Linda pounded her fist on the table in a fun way, to make the point: “It’s easy to lose yourself in a kid, even easier if you love it. Your husband comes back, he’s tired, you’re tired, in the end all you have time for is a little kiss on the mouth and a conversation about what the little baby ate that day. Nobody sees you as <em>yourself</em> anymore, only as the walking mouthpiece for that cute bud of flesh. But, let me tell you, it gets easier. I know it.” Karen tried to think of what her identity-restoring ritual might be. Her feet ached, her shoes were sweaty. Seated in Karen’s lap, Lila reached out a small hand for the soiled napkin on the table, grasped it vaguely, let it slip back.</p><p>“But you can’t let yourself get down about not feeling a hundred per cent of the time like the new person you’re supposed to be,” Linda added with a concerned tone to her voice, her bangs bobbing up and down as she spoke. “It’s those expectations, honey. They’ll drive you insane.”</p><p>Karen nodded. Then she remembered the stroller. She had been sitting in the café for more than an hour. Linda’s salad was long gone.</p><p>“Oh, God,” Karen said. “I have to go back.”</p><p>“Go back where?” Linda asked, distracted.</p><p>“For the stroller. Part of it broke, the wheel’s off, I can’t put the baby back in it. Someone’s going to take it if I leave it there too long.” Karen didn’t trust the people of this city, the city in which she lived. In her last city, she smiled or waved when she saw strangers looking at her.</p><p>“Oh, don’t worry about it! I’ll watch the baby,” Linda said, waving her hands in the air to show it was no big deal.</p><p>Karen hesitated.</p><p>“Look, honey,” Linda said. “You haven’t got a choice. Life’s like that sometimes—you gotta take care of business. You’re going to go do your business and come right back, and I’ll be right here with the little one, reading my magazine. It’s the only way.”</p><p>“You’re sure?” Karen asked.</p><p>“Yes, yes, yes,” Linda said warmly. “Just go, I’ll tend to her every need.”</p><p>“I’ll just be fifteen minutes,” Karen said, embarrassed.</p><p>“Yes, yes, yes,” Linda said. “Get out of here.”</p><p>Karen picked up her tote and looked down at Lila, still reaching for the napkin, still failing. Karen took the napkin and folded it into a small square, which she slipped into the bag. “I’ll be gone for a moment,” she said to the infant in an upbeat, gentle voice. “And then I’ll be back.” She thought. “It means nothing,” she added, tenderly. As she stepped out the door she looked back. She expected to see Linda smiling toothily, holding Lila’s little hand and waving it around in a semblance of goodbye. Instead, Linda was rooting around in her handbag for something. Linda and Lila: those names went together better than Karen and Lila. What would it signify if Lila chose to unfurl her first words in front of a kind stranger rather than her own mother?</p><p>Outdoors the sun made her squint and the air smelled of cars. Her husband would have found a way to reclaim the stroller without losing sight of the baby. He had always been good with logistics, one of those people who behaved as though they had the instruction manual for the world. Since the baby was born, this quality had become exaggerated. Her husband seemed crisper and clearer. His jaw was better defined and when he moved around the kitchen putting coffee mugs back in their place his gestures had a mimelike precision. She was amazed to see him come into focus. But sometimes she had the feeling that she had come into focus for him, too, and what<span data-page="page_5"></span> he saw puzzled him.</p><p>The night they brought Lila home, Karen had folded a soft striped blanket in half and then in half again, making a bed for the baby so she could sleep between their bodies. As she placed it on the mattress and pressed into it a baby-shaped depression, her husband walked in. He lunged toward the bed and grabbed the blanket from her as if it were a burning thing. “What do you think you’re doing?” he said, his voice rough. “Babies die that way,” he said, and hurled the blanket at the wall. After they had turned out the lights, he rolled over and covered her in a slew of silent kisses before falling asleep.</p><p>As Karen walked back toward the corner where she had abandoned the stroller, she realized that, for all Linda’s talk about mothering and its pressures, she had never said explicitly that she had children of her own. For all Karen knew, Linda was as bad at it as she was.</p><p>The stroller was intact, its wheel still lying in a patch of marigolds several yards back. Nothing was missing except a few energy bars and a handkerchief from the side pouch, which showed that somebody willing to steal had decided that the bulky vehicle was not worth the trouble. The blisters on Karen’s feet had spread to the thick skin of the sole, and she knew she wouldn’t make it back to the café unless she wrapped her feet up. Even so, she felt oddly good as she dragged the stroller behind her: a stranger watching from across the street might have described her as “full of purpose.” She felt that Linda had said something that she herself had wished to say for some time. She had to find herself, inside herself, if she was ever going to feel connected again to the things she did all day. She thought about a friend she once had, and the long e-mails they had written to each other during their freshman year, describing at weekly intervals precisely how they felt college was changing them, as though meticulously logging this data could keep it all within their control. “I’m leaving you this trail of crumbs so you can find me and return me to myself if I wander too far away.” Karen couldn’t remember which one of them had written that junk line. Now her friend was living in Hollywood, a recovering heroin addict who never returned anybody’s calls.</p><p>Karen left the stroller leaning on its empty titanium hub outside a drugstore and limped inside. At the sound of the doors sliding open, the cashier at the counter looked up, then dismissed her immediately. The cashier was carving little marks into the checkout counter with a small, pointy pair of scissors. Karen limped past light bulbs and window cleaner, rejuvenated. Even here, in these boring and overlit aisles, her new good mood made it feel as though anything could happen: she could run into a friend or an ex-lover, she could receive an important phone call, she could have an important thought that would make her whole situation apparent. She stood in front of the bandages and Band-Aids, taking in all their myriad shapes and colors—clear, nude, cloth-covered, breathable plastic, patterned with racing cars and cartoon dolphins. She read the backs of the boxes: all the energy and force she would next use to find herself she directed toward this first decision, a practice decision. To her right, a man watched her, his hands in his pockets. He had a nice face, with big teeth and ears. When you looked at his face, you could see right through it to the one he had as a little boy. It was easy to imagine him hanging upside down on a swing or standing in front of a rosebush, swatting at it with a broken-off stick. Karen saw him staring at her. She thrust forward a package of Band-Aids.</p><p>“Are you looking for these?” she demanded.</p><p>“Ah, no, sorry,” he said. He paused. “It’s just, I think I know you.” He had a look on his face as if he were waiting for her to complete a sentence.</p><p>“From where?” Karen asked. She looked more closely at his whole person. He wore a white button-down shirt. She had always had trouble recognizing people she knew when they dressed up for work.</p><p>He named the college in Connecticut that she had gone to. He had been a film major—the film program had changed since he’d gone there, he told her, it used to deal in concrete skills, the mechanics of shooting and editing a film. Now it was mostly where people went to argue about movies. Sometimes they invited him back to give a talk and he thought about refusing, but in the end he did it anyway, because if he could, in his thirty-minute talk, impart any advice on how one manipulates the substance of film he felt that it was his duty. Karen nodded. She relaxed. With his patronizing tone and his floppy brown hair, he was just the sort of person she used to listen to at parties, trying to think of intelligent, psychologically driven questions to ask while taking small sips from a cup of lukewarm beer. She had always been interested in people like this; in their<span data-page="page_6"></span> arrogance, they reminded her of the type of stylized, opinionated person she might have become if she had been a man.</p><p>“How about you?” he asked abruptly, as if she had vanished suddenly and had just now reappeared.</p><p>“Well,” Karen said, “I’m still writing.”</p><p>“That’s great. What do you write?” He had an interested but slightly lost expression on his face.</p><p>She wrote essays. She had written profiles of well-known people—actresses and an artist who sculpted glaciers out of man-made and toxic materials. She had written a long reported article on water sanitation. She had ghostwritten a book by a comedian whose awkward jokes about foreigners were obsolete; all that was left to him was to cash in on the stories he had of performing with people whose more robust fame persisted to this day.</p><p>As Karen spoke, she saw that her old classmate was impressed by the things she had accomplished. She felt content. Talking about work had always made her feel more like herself. He asked thoughtful questions and she answered them, taking up almost all the space in the conversation. Something in her was eager to expand, to monopolize, to be casually selfish, in the way that others often were with her. She felt free, in an old, almost forgotten way. The happiest week of her life had been in college, the summer after junior year. She had stayed in town working at the library, where she catalogued old, miscellaneous photos according to the objects or themes they contained: Fanaticism, Rhinoceros, Etiquette. At the end of August, other students who had spent the summer in town went home to visit their families for a week or two, but Karen’s parents were at a convention. So she worked unsupervised in the frosty archive and after work she jogged five miles to an old railway bridge over the river, where she dangled her feet and looked down, watching trash and swathes of plant debris pass below. When her mother called, she turned her phone face down and left it there. She would call back several hours later, once she was sure her family were all asleep.</p><p>She talked and he nodded. Talking was easy, as it used to be when she was younger and as it would be again in the future. This town, which was still foreign to her, would become home and home would slip into foreignness. It was only in this small sliver of her life that she would be lonely, and it would pass. But then Karen noticed that the man was looking at her more intently than before. She turned away, a reflex.</p><p>“Listen,” he said seriously. “I’m glad you’re not still upset, but I wanted to apologize.”</p><p>“Apologize for what?” Karen asked.</p><p>“You know, for what happened that last year of school.” He picked a box of toothpaste up from the shelf, glanced at it, and put it back down.</p><p>Karen searched her college memories for times when she had been wronged. Most of her life, she felt, had been spent alone in rooms.</p><p>“I don’t know,” she said.</p><p>“For the video. I hear it messed you up.” Karen could tell he was annoyed that she was making him reassemble the whole situation in words. “The video of you,” he said. “The one I used for class. I know it seemed exploitative, but the idea was to implicate myself. About being male in the cultural moment of the sex tape.”</p><p>“No,” Karen said. “I don’t think anything like that’s happened to me.”</p><p>He looked at her in disbelief.</p><p>“I don’t think I’m who you’re thinking of,” Karen said slowly. “When exactly were you there?”</p><p>It became clear that he had graduated several years after her; they hadn’t even overlapped. She had a young face for her age, or he had an old one. They stood in the toothpaste-Band-Aid aisle feeling uncomfortable. To Karen he was worse than a stranger: she knew with certainty that something weird lurked inside him. He sensed her change in attitude and stuck his hands back in his pockets. “What did you mean, ‘the cultural moment of the sex tape’?” Karen asked. He didn’t seem to hear her. Already he seemed a mile away—he was closing up as she watched.</p><p>“What did you do?” Karen asked. She stared at him.</p><p>“I don’t remember,” he said, unconvincingly. “It was forever ago.”</p><p>Karen suddenly realized that she hadn’t thought of her husband in more than an hour. Had he thought of her, even once?</p><p>The sun was setting behind the cross-hatching of oak trees as Karen dragged the empty, tilting stroller toward the café as quickly as she could. The sight of the intent, ferocious-looking woman with the empty stroller alarmed the people she passed, but Karen didn’t notice. She was truly ready to go home. It seemed incredible to her that just a few hours earlier she had thought that staying in that apartment for another second could kill her. Now she knew that she would become irreparably warped if she spent another minute out here. She felt as if she were deep underwater, desperately stroking up toward the surface, toward light and air. She had no idea how far away it might be.</p><p>She’d get back to the café, thank Linda for her time, and hurry her baby home. Home was still a safe<span data-page="page_final"></span> space. Everything had gone well there, in the end. Puldron was alive, he hadn’t choked, not completely. And, even if he had, the choking was just another corporeal encounter, the body articulating itself around the obstacle of that which choked it. It didn’t mean anything more than that. The word “express” derived from the medieval Latin “expressare,” meaning to “press out” or “obtain by squeezing.” The word had once been used as a term for extortion. It was possible that to cough, to choke, was the root of all speech: the urgent need to evacuate something whose internality threatened to kill you. To express yourself or be expressed by extruding words. It was just a bodily function, like sweating or throwing up. Sometimes you felt relief afterward, but there was no point in doing it unless you had to. Lila would speak on her own schedule, when the small, mild experiences she was accumulating finally coalesced into something she needed to expel.</p><p>The past was just a place where uncontrolled freaks you had never consciously decided to include in your life entered it anyway and staggered around, breaking things. Compared with the gentle, competent family she had chosen, they were monsters. Even someone like Linda, seemingly so warm and lively, was an unknown. Though Karen had felt happy and connected after talking to her, when she reflected on their conversation she realized that they had spoken mostly about Linda herself, mostly in glowing terms, without Karen’s learning anything concrete that would make her real. Since graduating from college, since getting engaged and then married, since moving to this new, worse city, Karen had mourned her growing isolation. She had longed for the unpredictable, haphazard quality that other people had, which she had found beautiful. But what seemed more beautiful to her now was the new being, unsullied, perfect in every way, whose entire existence so far had unfolded under her gaze.</p><p>As she rounded the corner to the block where she would find the café, Karen saw that something had gone on. In the vivid blue dusk, flashes of a brighter blue alternated with hot red, electrifying the trunks of trees and the sides of buildings. A few people milled around talking, while others walked past as though everything were just as it should be. With a terrified expression on her face, Karen ran with the ugly stroller, her feet festooned with Band-Aids, toward police cars up ahead.</p><p>As she came close she saw, first, a policewoman with a short blond ponytail, then her partner, who had a notepad, and then a potbellied man explaining something to him with vigorous gestures. She saw the vehicles double-parked by the entrance to the café, where the lights were on and the barista slid a rag along the counter. There was no sign of Linda, or of her garish pinks and greens: Linda was gone. The light was ending. And then in the arms of a policeman standing in the yellow sheet of light cast by a street lamp that had just come on—she saw Lila, she saw her baby. She squirmed gently, held by a stranger. Linda had left her there, gone about her own business. With a shudder, Karen thought of the stranger’s hands, the strange hot arms.</p><p>Inside the baby, something was taking shape. There were colors and planes, indistinct, as if viewed through a thick layer of water. There was dimness and cold, the unmoored perception of bright blue and red, flashing. The baby watched as her mother came toward her with a face full of terror. The two eyes large and wild, the mouth pouring. With her gentle mind, the baby took in the face and waited, waited as it sank slowly to the top of a pile of things without names, waited for the noisy world to become still once more. It was all collecting inside there, gathering like dust, building, building up, until someday there would be enough for some part to pierce the surface of her silence and gasp out a piece of what lay beneath. ♦</p>	Alexandra Kleeman	May 2, 2016 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/05/02/choking-victim-by-alexandra-kleeman	Babies	Books	Children	Choking	Eavesdropping	Loneliness	Karen	Third	Children
Christie	<p>When <span data-page="page_1"></span>you met Christie for the first time, it took only minutes to learn that she was from Greenwich, Connecticut, but months could go by before you got another solid fact out of her. After a couple of years in New York, she realized that she had to give people a little more information to stop them wondering, so once she’d mentioned Greenwich she would quickly add that she’d gone to “the high school,” meaning the public one. The first time she said this, you’d find her forthrightness refreshing—disarming, even, in the midst of so many pretenders. You’d be prompted, perhaps, to admit something about yourself—the fact that you were doing Jenny Craig, for instance, and had to sneak the packaged food into your office microwave when no one was paying attention. But then you’d overhear Christie making the same confession to someone else, and it would lose its charm. It was just Fact No. 2, which, added to Fact No. 1—her childhood in Greenwich—represented the sum total of what could be stated about Christie Thorn’s background, about her entire life before college and New York.</p><p>Plus, you couldn’t help being suspicious of her motives in revealing Fact No. 2. If, at a party, a group of people were standing around, sharing a corner of the room, and someone made an opening bid—mentioning Hotchkiss or St. George’s, say—Christie would always pointedly interject, “Oh, I wouldn’t know. I went to public school. Greenwich High. That’s right—I was a good old suburban kid.” Of course, Christie and the person who had mentioned boarding school were doing the same thing—preëmptively defending themselves against attack—and yet you were tempted to give the Hotchkiss guy a free pass. With him, you could figure that his parents had divorced badly, or his mother was an alcoholic, or his brother had committed suicide (or perhaps it really had been an accidental overdose), or that in keeping with the family tradition Dad had gone crazy and now spent his days in slippers and a robe shooting intricate, archaic forms of pool. On account of one or more of these family problems, the young man felt insecure about himself as an individual, and so, in situations of social challenge, he mentioned boarding school a little too early, and a little unnaturally, to shore up his resolve. Still, whatever his problem, whatever the big bad family secret, it was just the slightly burned edge on a cake that everyone still wanted to eat. How bad could those family problems really be, you’d asked yourself more than once, if, at the same time, you had a house on the Vineyard? How bad—if you had the gray shingles, the weathered shutters, the slanting attic roof, the iron bedstead, the needlepoint pillows proclaiming, “A woman’s place is on the tennis court!,” the <em>batterie de cuisine</em> of lobster pots and potato mashers from the forties, and the octagonal kitchen window, through which you could glimpse the dunes and smell the salt air—could anything really be?</p><p>Meanwhile, you’d assume that Christie had more to protect, that her history was more embarrassing, somehow: a chronological downsizing of suburban homes (all of them, albeit, technically still in Greenwich), a cheapness in things like bedding and glassware, or four people sharing one bathroom with a standup shower. And you wouldn’t be wrong. The real story was simple, of course, simple and unnecessarily sad. Christie’s father had gone into business for himself and had cash-flow problems. That was all. No one had murdered anyone; there wasn’t a whiff of incest or abuse, embezzlement or even tax fraud. Mr. Thorn had owed money his whole life, but he paid his bills more or less on time, and, when he died, his life-insurance policy would pay off the mortgage on the house. He was an honest man with a clean conscience.</p><p>Yet Christie’s conscience was not clean, and seemed never to have been. In a typical scenario from her adolescence, her father would plan a nice vacation for the family, then wouldn’t have enough cash to cover it, Christie would throw a tantrum, and her mother, who spoiled her, would somehow find the money to appease her. Christie would go on the vacation, but she would go alone, with a similarly spoiled friend. She and the friend would go helling around Key West, say, or Miami Beach, feeling worse and worse and worse and laughing harder and harder. And then, and this was the kicker, Christie’s mother would pick them up at LaGuardia (the friend’s mother could never be bothered) and would want to know—would have been anxious about, primordially concerned about—whether they’d had a good time.</p><p>On the way back from one of these vacations when she was sixteen or seventeen, Christie and her friend checked in late and were bumped up to first class. They were separated, and Christie was seated next to a distinguished-looking older man. He drank Scotches and read a golf magazine, and, when the flight was delayed, the two became partners in peevish complaint, the man turning to Christie to include her in his “Can you believe this?” glare. Eventually, he asked her where she was from, and when she said, “Greenwich,” he looked at her with a kind of absolute approval that she couldn’t recall ever having inspired before. After that, whenever a flight of hers was delayed she’d shake her head and<span data-page="page_2"></span> say, “Time to spare, go by air,” as the Scotch-drinking man had, and when she met people she liked to make sure that they knew where she was from.</p><p>After college, after a prolonged phase of running around New York while drifting through a series of support jobs at big firms, and after she had slept with, I think, either fifty-five or sixty-five men, Christie found someone to marry. We spent a lot of time speculating as to who would be invited to the wedding (only a strange, angry girl named Mary McLean, who had made some Faustian bargain with Christie long before any of us met her, considered herself one of Christie’s <em>real</em> friends), but in the end everyone was invited—and to the Pierre, no less. Throughout the evening, Christie wore a look of incurable dissatisfaction. Her face was gaudily made up, as if for a school play or an ice-skating competition. At the reception, her parents seemed frightened. It was as if they had been instructed to keep their mouths shut at all costs. A guest would shake Mrs. Thorn’s hand in the receiving line and say, “Hi, I’m Jen Ryan. Christie and I were roommates at Trinity?” and Mrs. Thorn would nod, grimfaced, and say—literally—nothing. The groom’s name was Thomas Bruewald, and he was gawky and tall, with an oversized head and a unibrow. His parents were never identified. Apparently they were foreign. He had grown up half over here and half over there—in Bavaria, was it? Or Croatia? At any rate, it wasn’t Umbria or Aix or anywhere worth trying to lock in an invitation for. Bruewald had gone to one of those Euro institutes with the word “polytechnical” in the name. The champagne at the reception was a little too good, and some people had more than their fill and, by the end of the night, were making rude remarks. One guy said that Christie’s parents must have taken out a second mortgage to pay for the wedding. “Didn’t know you could get a second mortgage on a trailer,” somebody else said. And then, of course, you got “Hey, wait a minute! There are no trailers”—the crowd in unison—“in Greenwich, Connecticut!” But nobody said that the groom was funny-looking. You could pick on Christie for trying too hard, you could note the moment when Mr. Thorn took off his tuxedo jacket and started doing body shots with the bridesmaids, but you didn’t pick on the groom’s looks. You just didn’t go there.</p><p>Christie herself was quite pretty. She had large, unflawed features and blond hair that was only a shade or two lighter than her natural color. She was also thin. And, in an age when Manhattan had been overrun by the kind of chain stores you’d find at a suburban mall, these attributes had kept her in dates for a decade and the word “beautiful” had been lobbed over her head with surprising—to some of us, disturbing—frequency.</p><p>The groom had some kind of science-related job—engineering or drug research—that required a reverse commute to New Jersey. And, once the wedding was over, once the gift had been ordered (they had registered for everything but the kitchen sink, in anticipation, evidently, of dinners for sixteen at which oysters would be served and finger bowls required), once the thank-you note from Christie—Christie Bruewald now—had arrived, it seemed that only the sparsest smattering of social interactions was indicated, coffee or a drink twice a year. There was even some thought that the newlyweds would move out of the city. Christie had always talked non-stop about children (little trophies, one presumed, to fill up that bottomless pit of dissatisfaction), and the suburbs had been mentioned more than once.</p><p>Christie’s new thing, at our biannual meetings, was to brag about her visits to Thomas’s family in Europe. It was mystifying—one would not have thought an “in” in the former East Germany particularly brag-worthy, and, in any case, everyone at the wedding had seen how cowed the guy was, how classic the trade they had made. Did she think we didn’t see her boasts for what they were? She started to slip into conversation the fact that Thomas’s uncle had a title, or had had one—she was vague on the details—and she mentioned that there was a castle in the family. Her Christmas card (sent yearly to all of us, even though we had not sent one to her in years) introduced the Bruewald family crest. It was all so ludicrous and pathetic, really, when they were living in a studio in a high-rise on York Avenue.</p><p>“So why do you even see her?” my husband would ask. (I was married now, too.) “If she’s so awful, why don’t you dump her? Just don’t call back.” Like most men, he had no patience with these pseudo-friendships between women that drag on for years. The question bothered me, and in my head I came up with three reasons that I continued to see Christie Bruewald, née Thorn, at six-month intervals. First, I enjoyed taking note of her pretensions. I enjoyed seeing how far she would go. In a way, I had exulted in the family-crest Christmas card. I had put it up on the refrigerator and shown it to everyone who came over. I was dying, now, to see what would follow. When I met her for coffee, I went prepared<span data-page="page_3"></span> with a mental tape recorder to catch her appalling lapses in taste—not so much for myself as to pass on to everyone else. Second, there were, I have to admit, sparks of humanity in Christie’s pretensions, and in her desires, that I felt were missing in the rest of my life. She had coveted <em>a huge diamond ring</em>. She had hoped <em>to land a guy with money</em>. She had wanted her wedding to be an extravaganza, <em>a day she’d remember for the rest of her life</em>. She wasn’t “over it.” She wasn’t over anything. She knew what she wanted, and she wanted the kinds of things that the marketers of luxury goods describe as “the best”—Jacuzzis, chandeliers, access to the tropics in the middle of winter. Third, and finally, what got me, I suppose, were the indications of humanity in Christie’s life that had nothing to do with her pretensions. The family crest on the Christmas card had been embossed onto a picture of the Bruewalds and their new baby in matching red-and-green velvet outfits. The little girl looked exactly like Thomas—an odd-featured brown-haired old man. She wouldn’t have the advantage of Christie’s looks, and, for someone as entranced by the superficial as Christie was, that must have been hard to take. You could say that I felt sorry for her.</p><p>Still, despite my three reasons, a year or so after my own wedding I went through a period when I felt it was important to burn the fat from my life. Christie had begun to represent all that was wrong with New York—which, as usual, meant what I was tired of in myself. I wrote “Seeing people like Christie Thorn” on a list of things that were a waste of time, and when she called and left a message to start the back-and-forth that would culminate in our having lunch a few weeks later, I didn’t call back.</p><p>Perhaps I ended it then simply because the interesting part appeared to be over. Though my own life still seemed to me a fount of infinite promise, hers felt blandly curtailed. I realized that there was a part of me that had almost wanted her to make it, on her own terms, whatever they might be. The sad thing about Christie’s wedding was that it hadn’t been outrageous at all; it had been just another overpriced New York wedding spearheaded by a bride with too much makeup on. I found it all too easy to imagine how her story would continue, how, inevitably, it would end. I lived with that story, kept the thread going in my mind, and added to it from time to time, when some event in my own life recalled Christie’s unhappy mixture of envy and drive, of self-promotion and apology.</p><p>My version (wholly fictional) went something like this: Having married for money, Christie quickly discovers that she hasn’t married for enough. Realizing her mistake only deepens the dissatisfaction she feels with her life, and, in order to convince herself that things can still change, she has an innocuous little affair in the first six months of her marriage. The second affair, a year later, is not so innocuous. Thomas is doing as well as he ever has, but this is New York, and after their second child the Bruewalds are unable to afford a big enough apartment in the city and they make the move to the suburbs. (For Christie, Brooklyn, or a bohemian setup with the baby in the living room, has never been an option.) They buy a starter house in one of the less well-known towns of Westchester. They socialize a lot and their favorite friends are people like themselves, but who make a little less than they do, and are jealous of them for some other reason as well—Christie’s having lost the weight after her pregnancies, say. The kids are the usual product of a marriage like the Bruewalds’. They suffer from Christie’s frustrated ambition and their father’s subservience to it, and they end up angry and self-hating beneath a surface of entitlement. But the European influence helps to normalize them somewhat, and at least they know how to ski. When the children are grown and out of the house, Christie starts spending most of her time down at the time-share in Cancún, befriending other “party people,” whose spouses turn a blind eye. But she and Thomas never divorce because she’s afraid to be alone.</p><p>That would be about the size of it. It would end in a sorry, grasping old age, marked by an incivility to service people (flight attendants, doctors’ secretaries) and a dye job that wasn’t what it used to be.</p><p>It was what she deserved, wasn’t it? There is order in things, and people who spend a hundred grand on a wedding they can’t afford simply not to lose face should pay in some way. Who was she kidding?</p><p>It will be clear from my iteration of Christie’s excesses that, as a couple, my husband and I have always prided ourselves on living within our means. When the time comes for us to move into a bigger apartment, we understand that staying in the city will mean living at the back of a building, in interior rooms that open onto shaftways. So it’s only for kicks, just to see what we’re missing, that we ask our<span data-page="page_4"></span> broker to show us something fancy. We go prepared to look, to smile wistfully, and to depart, understanding that by any reasonable standards we have more than enough, and by any other standards we simply don’t measure ourselves. When, high up in Carnegie Hill, on our way into one of those hushed old buildings that face the Park, our two-year-old daughter falls in love with the doorman, we take it, laughing, with endless hope for the future, as a sign that the girl knows quality when she sees it. “You can see him on the way out,” we promise. “He’ll still be there.” Yet, when we fall in love with the apartment itself, we cannot take it as a sign of anything at all. It is smaller by a room than the others we’ve looked at; and costs more by . . . oh, about a hundred grand. Where are our wistful smiles now? Where is our comfort in reasonable standards? It is clear that we—and only we—are capable of fully appreciating the charm of this place. Who but we would actually enjoy the fact that the stove and the refrigerator appear, like the building, to be prewar? Who but we would keep the sixties-style wallpaper in the maid’s room? (The ghost of Christie Thorn shakes her head in annoyance at the broker: “Total gut job in the kitchen!” “No closet space!” “No wet bar!”) And then there is our daughter and the doorman, who is pretending to play hide-and-seek with her, while we stand wordless in the marble lobby, looking out at the green of the Park, doing sums in our head, reconsidering decisions of the past, decisions that might have netted us this apartment, pure and simple.</p><p>Because now nothing else will do.</p><p>The apartment is at the breaking point of our price range, and though on paper we can swing it, our broker calls that night with bad news: he’s shopped us to the board, and they are reluctant to consider anyone whose liquid assets are as low as ours. That fast, it’s over. We have been slotted into position. We know—and can laugh bitterly at the notion that this knowledge, in other circumstances, is supposed to be comforting—exactly where we are.</p><p>A week after the bad news, I walk by the building, daughterless this time. A man emerges, then two schoolgirls in uniform. I put my sunglasses on to hide the fact that I am staring in an ugly, covetous way. How tortured and unpleasant I must look compared with the woman my age who comes out next, well dressed, well coiffed, followed by two children, a girl and a boy, who are followed in turn by two nannies. For an incredible moment, I mistake the woman for an older, more sophisticated Christie Thorn. Out of habit I am pretending not to see even this twin of hers (the way you ignore a man in a bar who resembles your ex-boyfriend), when the doorman’s greeting rings out—yes, as if in a dream—“Mrs. Bruewald.” “Hi, Lester.” He asks how long she will be, and the woman says, “Oh, an hour or two. We’re just going to go to the Park and do some shopping before Daddy gets home.”</p><p>In a vile moment of Darwinian survival, I paste a smile on my face, and I call out, “Christie?”</p><p>We went to an Italian restaurant on Madison. Kids and nannies were dispatched to the Park. It was an off hour, three or four o’clock, and I remember I almost hated to dirty one of the white linen tablecloths, which were already set for dinner. We started with cappuccinos, then moved on to glasses of the house white. Later, when we got hungry, the waiter brought antipasto and some bread, and to wash it down I had another glass of white wine and Christie switched to red. I was longing for a cigarette, and eventually I asked her, “Do you still smoke?” “My God, I’m dying for one,” she said, and took a pack out of her purse. We each smoked two.</p><p>I should explain that it was one of those surreally springlike days at the tail end of winter, the kind of afternoon when you flirt with the mailman, the coffee-cart man, and the busboy, when you long for a new pair of open-toed sandals and a good excuse to sit in a café all afternoon, ignoring your responsibilities and getting drunk. Well, we had one. There was catching up to be done—husbands, children, careers, in a nutshell.</p><p>From the beginning, I was drinking rather fast. All the information-sharing, I realized, was making me uneasy. I, who used to rattle off insouciantly all the good things that had happened to me, was guarded now. I had something to protect, it seemed. I held back, forming half-truths for every potential question Christie might pose—asking myself, “Will I tell her about that or not? Will I act as if everything’s fine or will I level with her?”—while she grew expansive with me, as she now could. The family crest was not a joke; it was not a sham. In some little town in the former East Germany, the Bruewalds were evidently a big deal. “All the money was tied up in this castle in Saxony—this huge, horrible, dark, awful house—and, the minute Onkel Guenther died, Thomas and I looked at<span data-page="page_5"></span> each other and we were like, ‘We’re selling!’ It was like, before he died we couldn’t mention it, and the minute we got the news we never looked back. It was a done deal.” They had sold the <em>Schloss</em>, auctioned the furniture, and inherited the lot, except, of course, for what was in trust for Hildie and Axel. (It had occurred to me that although Hildie still resembled her father, her appearance would be seen, later in life, as distinguishing; people would seek ownership of those peculiar looks, the way they would those of a rock star’s eccentric-looking daughter. Only outsiders would make the obvious comments; insiders would know better.) In addition to the apartment on Fifth Avenue, the Bruewalds now owned a ski lodge in the Arlberg, a country house in New Jersey, and a mansion in Solln, which Christie described as “the Greenwich of Munich.”</p><p>The sheer weight of the information had made me dizzy, but when she mentioned Greenwich I sat up and did her the one courtesy I could. I fed her the line. “That must be nice,” I said. “It must feel like home.” She drained her glass of wine, though she had already drained it once, and then she put it down and unexpectedly met my eye. She said, “You know, when we got the money I went out and got myself a two-hundred-and-fifty-dollar-an-hour shrink. I used to think I was a horrible person.” She wasn’t a horrible person, the shrink had told her; in fact, there was nothing wrong with her at all.</p><p>We split a third glass of wine and then a fourth, making the waiter laugh. During the fourth, I told her why I had been loitering outside her building—not hoping to get something out of it, just wanting to ante up with something real of my own. Christie laughed, the way you laugh at something you don’t quite believe, and at first I interpreted her incredulity as an attack—that’s how defensive I felt. “Oh, for Christ’s sake!” she said. “You’ve got to be kidding!” I stared stonily at the table, the way I do when I’m both drunk and mortally offended. “No, no—listen. Thomas is on the board, and they owe him a big favor. This is no problem, no problem at all. Don’t believe what they say about the liquid assets. It’s just a way of keeping people out. Anyway,” she said, “I’ll tell them about your Mayflower ancestor.”</p><p>“I told you about our Mayflower ancestor?” I said.</p><p>“Of course you did!” She smiled. “The first time we met.”</p><p>There was nothing I could do but turn red and finish the wine. Christie went to the bathroom, and I sat there flipping a matchbook over and over in my hand. I had an anticipatory feeling, as if I were waiting for a date to return, as if we might be planning to go back to her deluxe pad and make out on her and Thomas’s king-size bed. People had always said that Christie had a great body, and that’s the kind of body it was—firm, relentlessly fit, and offered up as a commodity for others to comment on. In the early nineties, she had been an aerobics queen, logging two, three hours a day at the gym; now, of course, she was into yoga and Pilates, but, “to tell you the truth,” she’d confessed earlier in the afternoon, “I kind of miss the screaming and the jumping up and down.”</p><p>We had moved to the city at the same time—ten years ago now—and sitting there, playing with the matchbook, I tried to get a handle on what those ten years had amounted to. We had been single. Now we were <em>married</em> women with <em>children</em>. But, despite the italics in my head, I couldn’t seem to take it any further than that. My thoughts drifted to the apartment, trying again, I suppose, to notch the progress we had each made. If my husband and I got the place, we’d be cash-poor for a few years. With both of us working, we could bring in <em>x</em> amount per year, put <em>y</em> aside, and contribute <em>z</em> to our 401(k)s. But, even considering promotions and raises, there was a limit to <em>x</em>. <em>X</em> was fixed, and there was only <em>t</em>—time—to increase it. But time ate up your life. You could say, “In ten years,” “In twenty years.” But the problem was that then whatever it was would be <em>in</em> ten years, or <em>in</em> twenty years. A decade, two decades of your life would have gone by before you attained it. The fixity of <em>x</em> was the most bittersweet thing I had thought of in ages. Of course, it was comparing myself with Christie that had brought on all these thoughts. When she came out of the ladies’ room, looking as happy and drunk as I had felt a minute before, her innocence struck me like a storm. And I realized that what separated us, and perhaps had always separated us, was the understanding that I had only just reached: in life you can only get so far.</p><p>I walked home with the good news for my husband and daughter. It seemed that Christie and I were going to be friends again, or friends after all, I should say. My husband would be dubious, to say the least. “The same Christie Thorn you<span data-page="page_final"></span> told me you would never have coffee with again?” Nor would he like the idea of her getting us past the board; it would take a week to make him understand what had changed in the course of an afternoon and why it wasn’t the case that we were simply using her. Then again, I deserved a dose of his skepticism. I had carried on about her—had laughed in my best moments, but from time to time had been derisive, too, and even indignant. I asked myself, now, how I truly felt about all her pretensions. I went through them one by one—the wedding, the Christmas card, then little things, little remarks from her single days, her obsession with the “it” handbag every year, for instance. I came to the conclusion that none of it was worth getting worked up about. None of it was profound. As the shrink had evidently made clear, none of it had anything to do with Christie herself. On the contrary, I told myself, it was <em>your</em> problem. ♦</p>	Caitlin Macy	March 10, 2003 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/03/10/christie	Castles	Children	Doormen	Germany	New York City	Real Estate	Unnamed	First	Children
Cold Little Bird	<p>It <span data-page="page_1"></span>started with bedtime. A coldness. A formality.</p><p>Martin and Rachel tucked the boy in, as was their habit, then stooped to kiss him good night.</p><p>“Please don’t do that,” he said, turning to face the wall.</p><p>They took it as teasing, flopped onto his bed to nuzzle and tickle him.</p><p>The boy turned rigid, endured the cuddle, then barked out at them, “I really don’t like that!”</p><p>“Jonah?” Martin said, sitting up.</p><p>“I don’t want your help at bedtime anymore,” he said. “I’m not a baby. You have Lester. Go cuddle with him.”</p><p>“Sweetheart,” Rachel said. “We’re not helping you. We’re just saying good night. You like kisses, right? Don’t you like kisses and cuddles? You big silly.”</p><p>Jonah hid under the blankets. A classic pout. Except that he wasn’t a pouter, he wasn’t a hider. He was a reserved boy who generally took a scientific interest in the tantrums and emotional extravagances of other children, marvelling at them as though they were some strange form of street theatre.</p><p>Martin tried to tickle the blanketed lump of person that was his son. He didn’t know what part of Jonah he was touching. He just dug at him with a stiff hand, thinking a laugh would come out, some sound of pleasure. It used to work. One stab of the finger and the kid exploded with giggles. But Jonah didn’t speak, didn’t move.</p><p>“We love you so much. You know?” Martin said. “So we like to show it. It feels good.”</p><p>“Not to me. I don’t feel that way.”</p><p>“What way? What do you mean?”</p><p>They sat with him, perplexed, and tried to rub his back, but he’d rolled to the edge of the bed, nearly flattening himself against the wall.</p><p>“I don’t love you,” Jonah said.</p><p>“Oh, now,” Martin said. “You’re just tired. No need to say that sort of stuff. Get some rest.”</p><p>“You told me to tell the truth, and I’m telling the truth. I. Don’t. Love. You.”</p><p>This happened. Kids tested their attachments. They tried to push you away to see just how much it would take to really lose you. As a parent, you took the blow, even sharpened the knife yourself before handing it to the little fiends, who stepped right up and plunged. Or so Martin had heard.</p><p>They hovered by Jonah’s bed, assuring him that it had been a long day—although the day had been entirely unremarkable—and he would feel better in the morning.</p><p>Martin felt like a robot saying these things. He felt like a robot thinking them. There was nothing to do but leave the boy there, let him sleep it off.</p><p>Downstairs, they cleaned the kitchen in silence. Rachel was troubled or not, he couldn’t tell, and it was better not to check. In some way, Martin was captivated. If he were Jonah, ten years old and reasonably smart, starting to sniff out the world and find his angle, this might be something worth exploring. Getting rid of the soft, warm, dumb providers who spun opportunity around you relentlessly, answering your every need. Good play, Jonah. But how do you follow such a strong, definitive opening move? What now?</p><p>Over the next few weeks, Jonah stuck by his statement, wandering through their lives like some prisoner of war who’d been trained not to talk. He endured his parents, leaving for school in the morning with scarcely a goodbye. Upon coming home, he put away his coat and shoes, did his homework without prompting. He helped himself to snacks, dragging a chair into the kitchen so that he could climb on the counter. He got his own glass, filling it with water at the sink. When he was done eating, he loaded his dishes in the dishwasher. Martin, working from home in the afternoons, watched all this, impressed but bothered. He kept offering to help, but Jonah always said that he was fine, he could handle it. At bedtime, Martin and Rachel still fussed over Lester, who, at six years old, regressed and babified himself in order to drink up the extra attention. Jonah insisted on saying good night with no kiss, no hug. He shut his door and disappeared every night at 8 <em class="small">p.m.</em></p><p>When Martin or Rachel caught Jonah’s eye, the boy forced a smile at them. But it was so obviously fake. Could a boy his age do that?</p><p>“Of course,” Rachel said. “You think he doesn’t know how to pretend?”</p><p>“No, I know he can pretend. But this seems different. I mean, to have to pretend that he’s happy to see us. First of all, what the fuck is he so upset about? And, second, it just seems so kind of . . . grownup. In the worst possible way. A fake smile. It’s a tool one uses with strangers.”</p><p>“Well, I don’t know. He’s ten. He has social skills. He can hide his feelings. That’s not such an advanced thing to do.”</p><p>Martin studied his wife.</p><p>“O.K., so you think everything’s fine?”</p><p>“I think maybe he’s growing up and you don’t like it.”</p><p>“And you like it? That’s what you’re saying? You like this?”</p><p>His voice had gone up. He had lost control for a minute there, and, as per motherfucking usual, it was a deal-breaker. Rachel put up her hand, and she was gone. From the other room, he<span data-page="page_2"></span> heard her say, “I’m not going to talk to you when you’re like this.”</p><p>O.K., he thought. Goodbye. We’ll talk some other time when I’m not like this, a.k.a. never.</p><p>Jonah, it turned out, reserved this behavior solely for his parents. A probing note to his teacher revealed nothing. He was fine in school, did not act withdrawn, had successfully led a team project on Antarctica, and seemed to run and play with his friends during recess. Run and play? What animal were they discussing here? Everybody loved Jonah was the verdict, along with some bullshit about how happy he seemed. “Seemed” was just the thing. Seemed! If you were an idiot who didn’t know the boy, who had no grasp of human behavior.</p><p>At home, Jonah doted on his brother, read to him, played with him, even let Lester climb on his back for rides around the house, all fairly verboten in the old days, when Jonah’s interest in Lester had only ever been theoretical. Lester was thrilled by it all. He suddenly had a new friend, the older brother he worshipped, who used to ignore him. Life was good. But to Martin it felt like a calculated display. With this performance of tenderness toward his brother, Jonah seemed to be saying, “Look, this is what you no longer get. See? It’s over for you. Go fuck yourself.”</p><p>Martin took it too personally, he knew. Maybe because it was personal.</p><p>One night, when Jonah hadn’t touched his dinner, they were asking him if he would like something else to eat, and, because he wasn’t answering, and really had not been answering for some weeks now, other than in one-word responses, curt and formal, Martin and Rachel abandoned their usual rules, the guideposts of parenting they’d clung to, and moved through a list of bribes. They dangled the promise of ice cream, and then those monstrosities passing for Popsicles, shaped like animals with chocolate faces or hats, which used to turn Jonah craven and desperate. When Jonah remained silent and sort of washed-out looking, Martin offered his son candy. He could have some right now. If only he’d fucking say something.</p><p>“It’s just that you’re all in his face,” Rachel said to him later. “How’s he supposed to breathe?”</p><p>“You think my desire for him to speak is making him silent?”</p><p>“It’s probably not helping.”</p><p>“Whereas your approach is so amazing.”</p><p>“My approach? You mean being his mother? Loving him for who he is? Keeping him safe? Yeah, it is pretty amazing.”</p><p>He turned over to sleep while Rachel clipped on her book light.</p><p>They’d ride this one out in silence, apparently.</p><p>Yes, well. They’d written their own vows, promising to be “intensely honest” with each other. They had not specifically said that they would hold up each other’s flaws to the most rigorous scrutiny, calling out each other’s smallest mistakes, like fact checkers, believing, perhaps, that the marriage would thrive only if all personal errors and misdeeds were rooted out of it. This mission had gone unstated.</p><p>In the morning, when Martin got up, Jonah sat reading while Lester played soldiers on the rug. Lester was fully dressed, his backpack near the door. There was no possible way that Lester had done this on his own. Obviously, Jonah had dressed his brother, emptied the boy’s backpack of yesterday’s crap art from the first-grade praise farm he attended, and readied it for a new day. Months ago, they’d asked Jonah to perform this role in the morning, to dress and prepare his brother, so that they could sleep in, and Jonah had complied a few times, but halfheartedly, with a certain mysterious cost to little Lester, who was often speechless and tear-streaked by the time they found him. The chore had quickly lapsed, and usually Martin awoke to a hungry, half-naked Lester, waiting for his help.</p><p>Today, Lester seemed happy. There was no sign of crying.</p><p>“Good morning, Daddy,” he said.</p><p>“Hello there, Les, my friend. Sleep O.K.?”</p><p>“Jonah made me breakfast. I had juice and Cheerios. I brought in my own dishes.”</p><p>“Way to go! Thank you.”</p><p>Martin figured he’d just play it casual, not draw too much attention to anything.</p><p>“Good morning, champ,” he said to Jonah. “What are you reading?”</p><p>Martin braced himself for silence, for stillness, for a child who hadn’t heard or who didn’t want to answer. But Jonah looked at him.</p><p>“It’s a book called ‘The Short.’ It’s a novel,” he said, and then he resumed reading.</p><p>A fat bolt of lightning filled the cover. A boy ran beneath it. The title lettering was achieved graphically with one long wire, a plug trailing off the cover.</p><p>“Oh, yeah?” Martin said. “What’s it about? Tell me about it.”</p><p>There was a long pause this time. Martin went into the kitchen to get his coffee started. He popped back out to the living room and snapped his fingers.</p><p>“Jonah, hello. Your book. What’s it about?”</p><p>Jonah spoke quietly. His little flannel shirt was buttoned up to the collar, as if he were headed out into a blizzard. Martin almost heard a kind of apology in his voice.</p><p>“Since I have to leave for school in fifteen minutes, and since I was hoping to get to page 100 this morning, would it be O.K. if I didn’t describe it to you? You can look it<span data-page="page_3"></span> up on Amazon.”</p><p>He told Rachel about this later in the morning, the boy’s unsettling calm, his odd response.</p><p>“Yeah, I don’t know,” she said. “I mean, good for him, right? He just wanted to read, and he told you that. So what?”</p><p>“Huh,” Martin said.</p><p>Rachel was busy cleaning. She hadn’t looked at him. Their argument last night had either been forgotten or stored for later activation. He’d find out. She seemed engrossed by a panicked effort at tidying, as if guests were arriving any second, as if their house were going to be inspected by the fucking U.N. Martin followed her around while they talked, because if he didn’t she’d roam out of earshot and the conversation would expire.</p><p>“He just seems like a stranger to me,” Martin said, trying to add a lightness to his voice so she wouldn’t hear it as a complaint.</p><p>Rachel stopped cleaning. “Yeah.”</p><p>For a moment, it seemed that she might agree with him and they’d see this thing similarly.</p><p>“But he’s not a stranger. I don’t know. He’s growing up. You should be happy that he’s reading. At least he wasn’t begging to be on the stupid iPad, and it seems like he’s talking again. He wanted to read, and you’re freaking out. Honestly.”</p><p>Yes, well. You had these creatures in your house. You fed them. You cleaned them. And here was the person you’d made them with. She was beautiful, probably. She was smart, probably. It was impossible to know anymore. He looked at her through an unclean filter, for sure. He could indulge a great anger toward her that would suddenly vanish if she touched his hand. What was wrong? He’d done something or he hadn’t done something. Figure it the fuck out, Martin thought. Root out the resentment. Apologize so hard it leaks from her body. Then drink the liquid. Or use it in a soup. Whatever.</p><p>Jonah came and went, such a weird bird of a boy, so serious. Martin tried to tread lightly. He tried not to tread at all. Better to float overhead, to allow the cold remoteness of his elder son to freeze their home. He studied Rachel’s caution, her distance-giving, her respect, the confidence she possessed that he clearly lacked, even as he saw the toll it took on her, what had become of this person who needed to touch her young son and just couldn’t.</p><p>Then, one afternoon, he forgot himself. He came home with groceries and saw Jonah down on the rug with Lester, setting up his Lego figures for him, such an impossibly small person, dressed so carefully by his own hand, his son—it still seemed ridiculous and a miracle to Martin that there’d be such a thing as a son, that a little creature in this world would be his to protect and befriend. Without thinking about it, he sat down next to Jonah and took the whole of the boy in his arms. He didn’t want to scare him, and he didn’t want to hurt him, but he needed this boy to feel what it was like to be held, to really be swallowed up in a father’s arms. Maybe he could squeeze all the aloofness out of the boy, just choke it out until it was gone. [cartoon id="a19475"]</p><p>Jonah gave nothing back. He went limp, and the hug didn’t work the way Martin had hoped. You couldn’t do it alone. The person being hugged had to do something, to be something. The person being hugged had to fucking exist. And whoever this was, whoever he was holding, felt like nothing.</p><p>Finally, Martin released him, and Jonah straightened his hair. He did not look happy.</p><p>“I know that you and Mom are in charge and you make the rules,” Jonah said. “But even though I’m only ten, don’t I have a right not to be touched?”</p><p>The boy sounded so reasonable.</p><p>“You do,” Martin said. “I apologize.”</p><p>“I keep asking, but you don’t listen.”</p><p>“I listen.”</p><p>“You don’t. Because you keep doing it. So does Mom. You want to treat me like a stuffed animal, and I don’t want to be treated like that.”</p><p>“No, I don’t, buddy.”</p><p>“I don’t want to be called buddy. Or mister. Or champ. I don’t do that to you. You wouldn’t want me always inventing some new ridiculous name for you.”</p><p>“O.K.” Martin put up his hands in surrender. “No more nicknames. I promise. It’s just that you’re my son and I like to hug you. We like to hug you.”</p><p>“I don’t want you to anymore. And I’ve said that.”</p><p>“Well, too bad,” Martin said, laughing, and, as if to prove he was right, he grabbed Lester, and Lester squealed with delight, squirming in his father’s arms.</p><p>Do you see how this used to work? Martin wanted to say to Jonah. This was you once, this was us.</p><p>Jonah seemed genuinely puzzled. “It doesn’t matter to you that I don’t like it?”</p><p>“It matters, but you’re wrong. You can be wrong, you know. You’ll die, without affection. I’m not kidding. You will actually dry up and die.”</p><p>Again, he found he had to explain love to this boy, to detail what it was like when you felt a desperate connection with someone else, how you wanted to hold that person and just crush him with hugs. But as<span data-page="page_4"></span> Martin fought through the difficult and ridiculous discussion, he felt as if he were having a conversation with a lawyer. A lawyer, a scold, a little prick of a person. Whom he wanted to hug less and less. Maybe it’d be simpler just to give Jonah what he wanted. What he thought he wanted.</p><p>Jonah seemed pensive, concerned.</p><p>“Does any of that make sense to you?” Martin asked.</p><p>“It’s just that I’d rather not say things that could hurt someone,” Jonah said.</p><p>“Well . . . that’s good. That’s how you should feel.”</p><p>“I’d rather not have to say anything about you and Mom. At school. To Mr. Fourenay.”</p><p>Mr. Fourenay was what they called a “feelings doctor.” He was paid, certainly not very much, to take the kids and their feelings very, very seriously. Martin and Rachel had trouble taking <em>him</em> seriously. He looked like a man who had subsisted, for a very long time, on a strict diet of the feelings of children. Gutted, wasted, and soft.</p><p>“Jonah, what are you talking about?”</p><p>“About you touching me when I don’t want you to. I don’t want to have to mention that to anyone at school. I really don’t.”</p><p>Martin stood up. It was as if a hand had moved inside him.</p><p>He stared at Jonah, who held his gaze patiently, waiting for an answer.</p><p>“Message received. I’ll discuss it with Mom.”</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>Without really thinking about it, Martin had crafted an adulthood that was essentially friendless. There were, of course, the friends of the marriage, who knew him only as part of a couple—the dour, rotten part—and thus they were ruled out for anything remotely candid, like a confession of what the fuck had just gone down in his own home. Before the children came, he’d managed, sometimes erratically, to maintain preposterous phone relationships with several male friends. Deep, searching, facially sweaty conversations on the phone with other semi-articulate, vaguely unhappy men. In general, these friendships had heated up and found their purpose around a courtship or a breakup, when an aria of complaint or desire could be harmonized by some pathetic accomplice. But after Jonah was born, and then Lester, phone calls with friends had become out of the question. There was just never a time when it was O.K., or even appealing, to talk on the phone. When he was home, he was in shark mode, cruising slowly and brutally through the house, cleaning and clearing, scrubbing food from rugs, folding and storing tiny items of clothing, and, if no one was looking, occasionally stopping at his laptop to see if his prospects had suddenly been lifted by some piece of tremendous fortune, delivered via e-mail. When he finally came to rest, in a barf-covered chair, he was done for the night. He poured several beers, in succession, right onto his pleasure center, which could remain dry and withered no matter what came soaking down.</p><p>The gamble of a friendless adulthood, whether by accident or design, was that your partner would step up to the role. She for you, and you for her.</p><p>But when Martin thought about Jonah’s threat—blackmail, really—he knew he couldn’t tell Rachel. In a certain light, the only light that mattered, he was in the wrong. The instructions were already out that they were not to get all huggy with Jonah, and here he’d gone and done it anyway. Rachel would just ask him what he had expected and why he was surprised that Jonah had lashed out at him for not respecting his boundaries.</p><p>So, yeah, maybe, maybe that was all true. But there was the other part. The threat that came out of the boy. The quiet force of it. To even mention that Jonah had threatened to report them for touching him ghosted an irreversible suspicion into people’s minds. You couldn’t talk about it. You couldn’t mention it. It seemed better to not even think it, to do the work that would begin to block such an event from memory.</p><p>The boys were talking quietly on the couch one afternoon a few days later. Martin was in the next room, and he caught the sweet tones, the two voices he loved, that he couldn’t even bear. For a minute he forgot what was going on and listened to the life he’d helped make. They were speaking like little people, not kids, back and forth, a real discussion. Jonah was explaining something to Lester, and Lester was asking questions, listening patiently. It was heartbreaking.</p><p>He snuck out to see the boys on the couch, Lester cuddled up against his older brother, who had a big book in his hands. A grownup one. On the cover, instead of a boy dashing beneath a bolt of lightning, were the good old Twin Towers. The title, “Lies,” was glazed in blood, which dripped down the towers themselves.</p><p>Oh, motherfucking hell.</p><p>“What’s this?” Martin asked. “What are you reading there?”</p><p>“A book about 9/11. Who caused it.”</p><p>Martin grabbed it, thumbed the pages. “Where’d you get it?”</p><p>“From Amazon. With my birthday gift card.”</p><p>“Hmm. Do you believe it?”</p><p>“What do you mean? It’s true.”</p><p>“What’s true?”</p><p>“That the Jews caused 9/11 and they all stayed home that day so they wouldn’t get killed.”</p><p>Martin excused Lester. Told him to skedaddle and, yes, it was O.K. to watch TV, even though<span data-page="page_5"></span> watching time hadn’t started yet. Just go, go.</p><p>“O.K., Jonah,” he whispered. “Jonah, stop. This is not O.K. Not at all O.K. First of all, Jonah, you have to listen to me. This is insane. This is a book by an insane person.”</p><p>“You know him?”</p><p>“No, I don’t know him. I don’t have to. Listen to me, you know that we’re Jewish, right? You, me, Mom, Lester. We’re Jewish.”</p><p>“Not really.”</p><p>“What do you mean, not really?”</p><p>“You don’t go to synagogue. You don’t seem to worship. You never talk about it.”</p><p>“That’s not all that matters.”</p><p>“Last month was Yom Kippur and you didn’t fast. You didn’t go to services. You don’t ever say Happy New Year on Rosh Hashanah.”</p><p>“Those are rituals. You don’t need to observe them to be part of the faith.”</p><p>“But do you know anything about it?”</p><p>“9/11?”</p><p>“No, being Jewish. Do you know what it means and what you’re supposed to believe and how you’re supposed to act?”</p><p>“I do, yes. I have a pretty good idea.”</p><p>“Then tell me.”</p><p>“Jonah.”</p><p>“What? I’m just wondering how you can call yourself Jewish.”</p><p>“How? Are you fucking kidding me?”</p><p>He needed to walk away before he did something.</p><p>“O.K., Jonah, it’s actually really simple. I’ll tell you how. Because everyone else in the world would call me Jewish. With no debate. None. Because of my parents and their parents, and their parents, including whoever got turned to dust in the war. Zayde Anshel’s whole family. You walk by their picture every day in the hall. Do you think you’re not related to them? And because I was called a kike in junior high school, and high school, and college, and probably beyond that, right up to this fucking day. And because if they started rounding up Jews again they’d take one look at our name and they’d know. And that’s you, too, mister. They would come for us and kill us. O.K.? You.”</p><p>He was shaking his fist in his son’s face. Just old-school shouting. He wanted to do more. He wanted to tear something apart. There was no safe way to behave right now.</p><p>“They would kill you. And you’d be dead. You’d die.”</p><p>“Martin?” Rachel said. “What’s going on?”</p><p>Of course. There she was. Lurking. He had no idea how long she’d been standing there, what she’d heard.</p><p>Martin wasn’t done. Jonah seemed fascinated, his eyes wide as his father ranted.</p><p>“Even if you said that you hated Jews, too, and that Jews were evil and caused all the suffering in the world, they would look at you and know for sure that you were Jewish, for sure! Buddy, champ, mister”—just spitting these names at his son—“because only a Jew, they would say, only a Jew would betray his own people like that.”</p><p>Jonah looked at him. “I understand,” he said. He didn’t seem shaken. He didn’t seem disturbed. Had he heard? How could he really understand?</p><p>The boy picked up the book and thumbed through it.</p><p>“This is just a different point of view. You always say that I should have an open mind, that I should think for myself. You say that to me all the time.”</p><p>“Yes, I do. You’re right.” Martin was trembling.</p><p>“Then do I have your permission to keep reading it?”</p><p>“No, you absolutely don’t. Not this time. Permission denied.”</p><p>Rachel was shaking her head.</p><p>“Do you see what he’s reading? Do you see it?” he shouted.</p><p>He waved the book at her, and she just looked at him with no expression at all.</p><p>After the kids were in bed, and the house had been quietly put back together, Rachel said they needed to talk.</p><p>Yes, we do, he thought, and about fucking time.</p><p>“Honestly,” she said. “It’s upsetting that he had that book, but the way you spoke to him? I don’t want you going anywhere near him.”</p><p>“Yeah, well, that’s not for you to say. You’re his mom, not mine. You want to file papers? You want to seek custody? Good luck, Mrs. Freeze. I’m his father. And you didn’t hear it. You didn’t hear it all. You have no fucking idea.”</p><p>“I heard it, and I heard you. Martin, you need help. You’re, I don’t know, depressed. You’re self-pitying. You think everything is some concerted attack on you. For the record, I am worried about Jonah. Really worried. Something is seriously wrong. There is no debate there. But you’re just the worst possible partner in that worry—the fucking worst—because you make everything harder, and we can’t discuss it without analyzing your bullshit feelings. You act wounded and hurt, and we’re all supposed to feel sorry for you. For you! This isn’t about you. So shut down the pity party already.”</p><p>When this kind of talk came on, Martin knew to listen. This was the scold she’d been winding up for, and if he could endure it, and cop to it, there might be some release and clarity at the other end. A part of him found these outbursts from Rachel thrilling, and in some ways it was possible that he co-engineered them, without really thinking about it. Performed the sullen and narcissistic dance moves that, over time, would yield this kind of eruption from her. His wife was alive. She cared. Even if it seemed that she might sort of hate him.<span data-page="page_6"></span></p><p>He circled the house for a while, cooling off, letting the attack—no, no, the truth—settle. Any argument or even discussion to the contrary would just feed her point and read as the defensive bleating of a cornered man. Any speech, that is, except admission, contrition, and apology, the three horsemen.</p><p>Which was who he brought back into the room with him.</p><p>Rachel was in bed reading, eyes burned onto the page. She didn’t seem even remotely ready to surrender her anger.</p><p>“Hey, listen,” Martin said. “So I know you’re mad, but I just want to say that I agree with everything you said. I’m scared and I’m worried and I’m sorry.”</p><p>He let this settle. It needed to spread, to sink in. She needed to realize that he was agreeing with her.</p><p>It was hard to tell, but it seemed that some of her anger, with nothing to meet it, was draining out.</p><p>“And,” he continued. He waited for her to look up, which she finally did. “You’ll think I’m kidding, and I know you don’t even want to hear this right now, but it’s true, and I have to say it. It made me a little bit horny to hear all that.”</p><p>She shook her head at the bad joke, which at least meant there was room to move here.</p><p>“Shut up,” she said.</p><p>This was the way in. He took it.</p><p>“You shut up.”</p><p>“Sorry to yell, Martin. I am. I just— This is so hard. I’m sorry.” [cartoon id="a19124"]</p><p>She probably wasn’t. This was simply the script back in, to the two of them united, and they both knew it. One day, one of them would choose not to play. It would be so easy not to say their lines.</p><p>“No, it’s O.K.,” he said to her, climbing onto the bed. “I get it. Listen, let’s take the little motherfucker to the shop. Get him fixed. I’ll call some doctors in the morning.”</p><p>They hugged. An actual hug, between two consenting people. A novelty in this house.</p><p>“O.K.,” she said. “I’m terrified. I don’t know what’s happening. I look at him and want so much to just grab him, but he’s not there anymore. What has he done to himself?”</p><p>“Maybe he just needs minor surgery. Does that work on 9/11 truthers?”</p><p>“Oh, look,” she said to him softly. “You’re back. The real you. We missed you.”</p><p>They talked a little and got up close to each other in bed. For a moment, their good feeling came on them—a version of it, anyway. It felt mild and transitory, but he would take it. It was nice. He was in bed with his wife, and they would figure this out.</p><p>“Listen,” he said to her. “Do you want to just shag a pony right now, get back on track?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” she said. “I feel gross. I feel depressed.”</p><p>“I feel gross, too. Let’s do it. Two gross people licking each other’s buttons.”</p><p>She went to the bathroom and got the jar of enabler. They took their positions on the bed.</p><p>He hoped he could. He hoped he could. He hoped he could.</p><p>He was cold and insecure, so he left his shirt on. And his socks.</p><p>They used a cream. They used their hands. They used an object or two. During the brief strain of actual fornication they persisted with casual conversation about the next day’s errands. In the early days of their marriage, this had seemed wicked and sexy, some ironic ballast against the animal greed. Now it just seemed efficient, and the animal greed no longer appeared. Minus the wet spot at the end, and the minor glow one occasionally felt, their sex wasn’t so different from riding the subway.</p><p>It turned out that there was a deep arsenal of medical professionals who would be delighted to consult on the problem of a disturbed child. Angry, depressed, anxious, remote, bizarre. Even a Jew-hating Jewish child who might very well be dead inside. Only when his parents looked at him, though. Only when his parents spoke to him. Important parameter for the differential.</p><p>They zeroed in on recommendations with the help of a high-level participant in this world, a friend named Maureen, whose three exquisitely exceptional children had consumed, and spat back out, various kinds of psych services ever since they could walk. Each of the kids seemed to romance a different diagnosis every month, so Maureen had a pretty good idea of who fixed what and for how much goddam moolah.</p><p>When they told her, in pale terms, about Jonah, she, as a connoisseur of alienating behavior from the young, got excited.</p><p>“This is so ‘The Fifth Child,’ ” she said. “Did you guys read that? I mean, you probably shouldn’t read that. But did you? It’s like a fiction novel. I don’t think it really happened. But it’s still fascinating.”</p><p>Rachel had read it. Happy couple with four children and perfect life have fifth child, leading to less perfect life. Much, much, much, much less perfect. Sorrow, sorrow, sorrow, grief, and sorrow. Not really life at all.</p><p>“Yeah, but the kid in that book is a monster,” Rachel said. “So heartless. He’s not real. And he just wants to inflict pain. Jonah wouldn’t hurt anyone. He wants to be alone. Or, not that, but. I don’t know what Jonah wants. He’s<span data-page="page_7"></span> not violent, though. Or even mad. I don’t think.”</p><p>“All right, but he is hurting you, right?” Maureen said. “I mean, it seems like this is really causing you guys a lot of pain and suffering.”</p><p>“I haven’t read the book,” Martin said. “But this isn’t about us. This is about Jonah. His pain, his suffering. We just want to get to the bottom of it. To help him. To give him support.”</p><p>In Rachel’s silence he could feel her agreement and, maybe, her surprise that he would, or even could, think this way. He knew what to say now. He wasn’t going to get burned again. But did he believe it? Was it true? He honestly didn’t even know, and he wasn’t so sure it mattered.</p><p>The doctor wanted to see them alone first. He said that it was his job to listen. So they talked, just dumped the thing out on the floor. It was ugly, Martin thought, but it was a rough picture of what was going down. The doctor scribbled away, stopping occasionally to look at them, to really deeply look at them, and nod. Since when had the act of listening turned into such a strange charade?</p><p>Then the doctor met with Jonah, to see for himself, pull evidence right from the culprit’s mouth. Martin and Rachel sat in the waiting room and stared at the door. What would the doctor see? Which kid would he get? Were they crazy and was this all just some preteen freak-out?</p><p>Finally, the whole gang of them—doctor, parents, and child—gathered to go over the plan, Jonah sitting polite and alert while the future of his brain was discussed. They told him the proposal: a slow ramp of antidepressants, along with weekly therapy, and then, depending, some group work, if that all sounded good to Jonah.</p><p>Jonah didn’t respond.</p><p>“What do you think?” the doctor said. “So you can feel better? And things can maybe go back to normal?”</p><p>“I told you, I feel fine,” Jonah said.</p><p>“Yes, good! But sometimes when we’re sick we think we’re not. That can be a symptom of being sick—to think we are well.”</p><p>“So all the healthy people are just lying to themselves?”</p><p>“Well, no, of course not,” the doctor said.</p><p>“Right now I never think about hurting myself, but you want to give me a medicine that might make me think about hurting myself?”</p><p>The doctor seemed uneasy.</p><p>“It’s called suicidal ideation,” Jonah said.</p><p>“And how do you know about that?” the doctor asked.</p><p>“The Internet.”</p><p>The adults all looked at one another.</p><p>“How come people are so surprised when someone knows something?” Jonah asked. “Your generation had better get used to how completely unspecial it is that a kid can look up a medicine online and learn about the side effects. That’s not me being precocious. It’s just me using my stupid computer.”</p><p>“O.K., good. Well, you’re right, you should be informed, and I want to congratulate you on finding that out for yourself. That’s great work, Jonah.”</p><p>Martin watched Jonah. He found himself hoping that the real Jonah would appear, scathing and cold, to show the doctor what they were dealing with.</p><p>“Thank you,” Jonah said. “I’m really proud of myself. I didn’t think I could do it, but I just really stuck with it and I kept trying until I succeeded.”</p><p>Martin could not tell if the doctor caught the tone of this response.</p><p>“But you might have also read that that’s a very uncommon symptom. It hardly ever happens. We just have to warn you and your parents about it, to be on the lookout for it.”</p><p>“Maybe. But I have none of the symptoms of depression, either. So why would you risk making me feel like I want to kill myself if I’m not depressed and feel fine?”</p><p>“O.K., Jonah. You know what? I’m going to talk to your parents alone now. Does that sound all right? You can wait outside in the play area. There are books and games.”</p><p>“O.K.,” Jonah said. “I’ll just run and play now.”</p><p>“There,” Martin said. “There,” after Jonah had closed the door. “That was it. That’s what he does.”</p><p>“Sarcasm? Maybe you don’t much like it, but we don’t treat sarcasm in young people. I think it’s too virulent a strain.” The doctor chuckled.</p><p>“No offense,” Martin said to the doctor, “and I’m sure you know your job and this is your specialty, but I think that way of speaking to him—”</p><p>“What way?”</p><p>“Just, you know, as if he were much younger. He’s just— I don’t think that works with him.”</p><p>“And how do you speak to him?”</p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p>“How do you speak to him? I’m curious.”</p><p>Rachel coughed and seemed uncomfortable. They’d agreed to be open, to let each other have ideas and opinions without feeling mad or threatened.</p><p>“It’s true,” she said. “I mean, Martin, I think you have been surprised lately that Jonah is as mature as he is. That seems to have really almost upset you. You know, you really have yelled at him a lot. We can’t just pretend that hasn’t happened.” She looked at him apologetically. “Aside,” she added, “from the scary things that he’s been saying.”</p><p>“Is it maturity? I don’t think so. Have I been upset? Fucking hell, yes. And so have you, Rachel. And not because he<span data-page="page_final"></span> thinks the Jews caused 9/11 or because he threatened to report us for sexual abuse for trying to hug him, which, for what it’s worth, I spared you from, Rachel. I spared you. Because I didn’t think you could bear it.”</p><p>Rachel just stared at him.</p><p>“What you’re seeing is a very, very bright boy,” the doctor said.</p><p>“Too smart to treat?” Martin asked.</p><p>“I think family therapy would be productive. Very challenging, but worthwhile, in my opinion. I could get you a referral. What you’re upset about, in relation to your son, may not fall under the purview of medicine, though.”</p><p>“The purview? Really?”</p><p>“To be honest, I was on the fence about medication. Whatever is going on with Jonah, it does not present as depression. In my opinion, Jonah does not have a medical condition.”</p><p>Martin stood up.</p><p>“He’s not sick, he’s just an asshole, is what you’re saying?”</p><p>“I think that’s a very dangerous way for a parent to feel,” the doctor said.</p><p>“Yeah?” Martin said, standing over the doctor now. “You’re right. You got that one right. Because all of a parent’s feelings are dangerous, you motherfucker.”</p><p>At home that night, Martin stuffed a chicken with lemon halves, drenched it in olive oil, scattered a handful of salt over it, and blasted it in the oven until it emerged deeply burnished, with skin as crisp as glass. Rachel poured drinks for the two of them, and they cooked in silence. To Martin, it was a harmless silence. He could trust it, and if he couldn’t, then to hell with it. He wasn’t going to chase down everything unsaid and shout it into their home, as if all important messages on the planet needed to be shared. He’d said enough, things he believed, things he didn’t. Quota achieved. Quota surpassed.</p><p>Rachel looked small and tired. Beyond that, he wasn’t sure. He was more aware than ever, as she set the table and put out Lester’s cup and Jonah’s big-kid glass, how impossibly unknowable she would always be—what she thought, what she felt—how what was most special about her was the careful way she guarded it all.</p><p>No matter their theories—about Jonah or each other or the larger world—their job was to watch over Jonah on his cold voyage. He had to come back. This kind of controlled solitude was unsustainable. No one could pull it off, especially not someone so young. Except that his reasoning on this, he knew, was wishful parental bullshit. Of course a child could do it. Who else but children to lead the fucking species into darkness? Which meant what for the old-timers left behind?</p><p>Dinner was brief, destroyed by the savage appetite of Lester, who engulfed his meal before Rachel had even taken a bite, and begged, begged to be excused so that he could return to the platoon of small plastic men he’d deployed on the rug. According to Lester, his men were waiting to be told what to do. “I need to tell my guys who to kill!” he shouted. “I’m in charge!”</p><p>At the height of this tantrum, Jonah, silent since they’d returned from the doctor’s office, leaned over to Lester, put a hand on his shoulder, and calmly told him not to whine.</p><p>“Don’t use that tone of voice,” he said. “Mom and Dad will excuse you when they’re ready.”</p><p>“O.K.,” Lester said, looking up at his brother with a kind of awe, and for the rest of their wordless dinner he sat there waiting, as patiently as a boy his age ever could, his hands folded in his lap.</p><p>At bedtime, Rachel asked Martin if he wouldn’t mind letting her sleep alone. She was just very tired. She didn’t think she could manage otherwise. She gave him a sort of smile, and he saw the effort behind it. She dragged her pillow and a blanket into a corner of the TV room and made herself a little nest there. He had the bedroom to himself. He crawled onto Rachel’s side of the mattress, which was higher, softer, less abused, and fell asleep.</p><p>In the morning, Jonah did not say goodbye on his way to school, nor did he greet Martin upon his return home. When Martin asked after his day, Jonah, without looking up, said that it had been fine. Maybe that was all there was to say, and why, really, would you ever shit on such an answer? ****</p><p>Jonah took up his spot on the couch and opened a book, reading quietly until dinner, while Lester played at his feet. Martin watched Jonah. Was that a grin or a grimace on the boy’s face? he wondered. And what, finally, was the difference? Why have a face at all if what was inside you was so perfectly hidden? The book Jonah was reading was nothing, some silliness. Make-believe and colorful and harmless. It looked like it belonged to a series, along with that book “The Short.” On the cover a boy, arms outspread, was gripping wires in each hand, and his whole body was glowing. ♦</p>	Ben Marcus	October 19, 2015 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/cold-little-bird	Books	Boys	Childhood	Children	Fathers	Geniuses	Martin	Third	Children
Creatures	<p>“Let’s <span data-page="page_1"></span>take a seat, shall we?” Mrs. Willing said, indicating the miniature chairs meant for three-year-olds. She lowered herself gracefully and perched on one haunch with disarming ease. James marvelled at the feat of physics that allowed such a large woman to balance so effortlessly, but a quick glance at his wife reminded him not to entertain thoughts of Mrs. Willing’s size. When Marco had come home from his first day at preschool announcing that his new teacher was fat, James had started up a riff: Fat as a bear? Fat as a whale? Fat as your big fat belly (followed by blowing onto Marco’s delightful stomach)? Melinda had laughed, but then insisted that they have a serious discussion about why we shouldn’t judge people by their looks because what counted was on the inside. James was certain that when Marco grew old enough to realize that this aphoristic world his parents insisted on did not exist he would despise them.</p><p>James could see that Melinda was on edge. Since they’d moved from the city, she’d put aside her utilitarian skirts and sexless blouses—a professional armor that had girded her for the daily battle at the hospital where she worked—in favor of more friendly and relaxed attire, better suited to a small-town medical practice and to the promise of this new, less stressful life. But for today she’d put on her best dress, a gray silk. A centipede of buttons crept over one shoulder and up the high collar, accentuating the delicacy of her frame, her finely structured face, and her grave expression. He’d fallen in love with her precise edges—her tidy hair, her fingernails filed into perfect almond shapes, the neatness of her pale mouth—and the fact that she took the world so seriously that serious things rarely shocked her the way they might a more frivolous woman. But he could tell, by the way she was rubbing together her forefinger and thumb, that she was uneasy. He’d noticed the habit on their fourth date, when it had been clear that something was romantically afoot between them and he’d decided to tell her about what had happened to him when he was a boy. She had taken the news in silence, nodding almost imperceptibly as if listening to the litany of one of her patients’ symptoms, her mind constructing and dismantling various possibilities as the information accrued, but her fingers had begun to work.</p><p>“As I mentioned in my e-mail,” Mrs. Willing said, “Marco’s recent behavior has been aggressive.”</p><p>“Did he hit someone?” Melinda asked. James was taken aback by how easily she accepted Mrs. Willing’s characterization of their son. But, of course, it had been her adaptability to discomfiting information that had allowed the fourth date to become the fifth, and a marriage and a child to follow.</p><p>Mrs. Willing laughed. “Oh, I wouldn’t have called you in for hitting,” she said lightly. “It’s the gunplay I’m concerned about.”</p><p>“You have toy guns here?” James said.</p><p>“Of course not,” Mrs. Willing said. “I’m talking about Marco’s guns.”</p><p>“We don’t buy toy guns for our son,” Melinda said.</p><p>She’d been adamant about that. They knew parents who had developed elaborate hierarchies about weaponry. Toy handguns were acceptable but not toy rifles. Or, no toy guns were allowed except water pistols, because those were hardly guns at all. One family disallowed all modern weaponry but had a veritable armory of toy swords and cudgels and crossbows, the justification being, vaguely, history.</p><p>“If he’s not hitting, what is the problem exactly?” James said to Mrs. Willing, his eyes travelling from her face to her lap, where she gripped a raspberry-colored folder as if it held a rap sheet filled with all of Marco’s preschool infractions. He knew that his tone was brusque, but it was his job to defend his son, even against this pleasant woman who had a master’s degree in child development and twenty years of classroom experience.</p><p>“He spends a lot of his free play chasing the other children with a stick,” Mrs. Willing said. She paused and lowered her voice. “He calls it his AK-47.”</p><p>“Marco doesn’t know what that is,” Melinda said.</p><p>“None of the other children talk about semi-automatic weapons,” Mrs. Willing said.</p><p>“Only handguns?” James said.</p><p>Mrs. Willing’s smile wavered between appreciation and censure, political correctness confusing any genuine response she might have.</p><p>“Some of the other children are frightened of him,” she said.</p><p>“Of Marco?” The image of his son’s sweet monkey face, his milk-chocolate eyes, his plump cheeks, and his loose spirals of chestnut hair appeared to James. And Marco’s voice! The low gravel of it, as though he’d been born with a two-pack-a-day habit. This, and his inability to pronounce his “r”s, was a combination that James found irresistible. “I <em>willy</em>, <em>willy want it</em>,” James would sometimes whisper throatily into the back of Melinda’s warm neck. “Frightened of Marco?” he repeated.</p><p>“He told Sam he was going to kill him,” Mrs. Willing said quietly.</p><p>Melinda let out a sound, and Mrs. Willing put a hand on her arm, a gesture that might have been sympathetic if it weren’t so cannily inclusive, suggesting that Melinda had already made the same leap as Mrs. Willing: from Marco running around with a stick to Marco shooting up a school.</p><p>“Children say things,” James said.</p><p>“Nevertheless,” Mrs. Willing said.</p><p>After the meeting, James<span data-page="page_2"></span> dropped Melinda at her office in town. When he returned to the house, he went straight to his workshop, in the converted garage. They had moved here a year earlier, when Melinda was burned out by the steady flow of stab wounds and battered women she treated at the hospital in the city and James was yearning for the simplicity of small-town life. The irony that he had made enough money to allow for this bucolic transition by designing the distinctive chairs and tables used by an urban caffeine empire was not lost on either of them—but it was that ongoing contract that had allowed them to purchase their hundred-year-old house and to buy out the practice of one of the town’s retiring doctors. The coffee-company franchises had proliferated at a nearly cellular rate. James needed to visit the factory that produced the furniture only every two months or so. The rest of the time, he was free to work on refurbishing their home.</p><p>James had always been good with his hands, even as a boy, when his belief that anything he could imagine he could also make was as strong and urgent in him as all the other unfounded faiths of childhood. He’d grown up in a suburb whose rural qualities had been a result of neglect, not design. His family’s house backed up against a ravine, and he had spent long hours staring out the window, imagining that if he pedalled his bicycle fast enough, and if his bicycle had wings, then he could race himself off one side of the ravine and soar straight across to the other. “That’s a lot of ifs,” his mother said. He can still remember his visceral conviction that she was wrong—that the difference between possibility and impossibility was no greater than the last twist of a wrench that finally loosened a bolt. He pestered her incessantly to study his crudely drawn designs, until, fed up with his unwillingness to recognize that she had three other children under the age of five to care for, she bought him a model airplane. To any other child whose family, on a budget, doled out one birthday gift and one Christmas gift a year, this might have seemed an unexpected boon. But James suffered through the hours in the dank basement that he and his reluctant father, dulled after his day’s work at the Toyota dealership, spent gluing together the minuscule parts of the German Stuka, both knowing, from opposite ends of experience, that a useless miniature could never compensate for a grand vision. On his ninth birthday, James asked to be taken to the St. Vincent de Paul dump. His parents, busy with, as it turned out, the unknitting of their marriage, were happy to have a son whose idea of a birthday gift was a trunk load of junk and a box of nails. They didn’t bother to find out what he was up to until he crash-landed into the ravine and broke his arm in two places.</p><p>Freddie Connolly was two years younger than James, a boy from the neighborhood whom James’s mother had agreed to watch on Saturdays for the pocket money. Freddie’s mother worked at a hair salon, and his father managed the night shift for the gas-and-electric company and slept during the day. Freddie had a crinkle of red hair and adenoidal breathing, which made him sound as if his nose were a clogged drainpipe. When he was particularly excited, his words came out in a rush of air and spit. James wasn’t happy to be saddled with this unappealing boy, but Freddie sat for hours and listened to James’s schemes, nodding his head fervently as if James were a Bible-thumping minister and Freddie his truest believer. Tape ten flattened cardboard boxes together to make a slide from the second-floor bedroom window right into the twins’ kiddie pool? Hallelujah! Re-create the Wizard of Oz’s balloon with dry-cleaning plastic, a bicycle pump, and a wicker hamper? Amen! James both derided his disciple for his unquestioning faith and was keenly aware that, without Freddie, he would be a boy with a head full of ideas that interested no one.</p><p>James ran his hand along a piece of birch that was lying on his workbench, studying the knots and whorls embedded in the wood, thinking vaguely of the table that would emerge from it. Memories of Freddie came to him at odd times—when Marco had a cold and his voice was thick with mucus, or when another child’s freckles brought to mind Freddie’s discolorations, which were laid on so thickly it was as if a painter had shaken out a brush on his ruddy cheeks.</p><p>All boys play with guns, James thought suddenly, the defensive rage he’d felt that morning at the preschool resurging. Though he himself had never craved that sort of toy. His mother had remarked on that when the police came to the house. She’d said she always thought it was funny that he’d never asked for a gun for Christmas, as if this were his larger crime.</p><p>That night, at the dinner table, Melinda gave James a meaningful look.</p><p>“Marco,” James began. “We have to talk about something.”</p><p>“Something important, honey,” Melinda added.</p><p>Marco speared a tube of pasta with his fork, then shook it so that the food danced and bits of red sauce flew onto<span data-page="page_3"></span> his placemat.</p><p>“Mrs. Willing said that maybe you are too rough at school,” James said.</p><p>Marco chewed, working his jaws with the tremendous effort of an ant laboring to move a pebble.</p><p>“Do you know what Daddy’s talking about?” Melinda said.</p><p>“Unh-unh,” Marco said, shaking his head.</p><p>“It’s about pretending to shoot people with a stick,” James said. “Some kids don’t like that.”</p><p>“No kids like that,” Melinda said. “When you point your stick at kids and pretend it’s a gun, it frightens them.”</p><p>“It is a gun,” Marco said.</p><p>“No, it’s not, sweetie,” Melinda said. “It’s just a stick.”</p><p>“It’s a gun,” Marco repeated.</p><p>“It’s a stick that you are pretending is a gun,” James said.</p><p>“It shoots bullets,” Marco said.</p><p>“Pretend bullets,” Melinda said.</p><p>“O.K.,” James said, unwilling to fall further into this rhetorical quagmire. “The point is: Sam was scared of the way you were playing.”</p><p>Marco put down his fork and looked at James as if to explain more clearly. “I’m the policeman and Sam is the <em>wobber</em>. He stoled. He’s the bad guy.”</p><p>“In the <em>game</em> he’s the bad guy, but not in real life. In real life, Sam is your friend,” Melinda said. “And we don’t tell our friends we want to ki— to hurt them. We don’t want to hurt anybody.”</p><p>Marco poked at his plate with his finger. “He’s the bad guy and I’m the policeman.”</p><p>“In the game,” Melinda said.</p><p>“This is ridiculous,” James mumbled. “Look, Marco. Here’s the deal. Don’t tell kids you’re going to kill them. Even if you’re playing bad guys and good guys. Even if you’re playing war, for fuck’s sake—”</p><p>“James!” Melinda said.</p><p>“Even if you’re playing war where the idea is to kill the other guy, because that’s the whole point of war. Just don’t do it. No killing. Not ever. O.K.? Those are Mrs. Willing’s rules, whether you like them or not.”</p><p>“And our rules,” Melinda added.</p><p>“Yes. And our rules, too. No killing Mommy and Daddy. O.K., Marco?”</p><p>“O.K., Daddy.”</p><p>Later, after they had put Marco to sleep, Melinda said what deserved to be said. He listened and apologized and agreed that children were confused by sarcasm and that it was peevish of him to try to turn his three-year-old son against his well-meaning teacher.</p><p>“But she is overreacting,” he said. “You have to admit that.”</p><p>“Sam was scared.”</p><p>“Sam should grow a pair.”</p><p>Finally, Melinda laughed. How he loved to make her laugh! Her careful exterior shattered into a peal of coquettish giggles. She was not an easy mark, and his ability to get a rise out of her made him feel capable beyond measure. It was the true cement of their intimacy.</p><p>“Still,” she said, calming down, “Mrs. Willing has to protect all the children.”</p><p>“Marco didn’t intend to scare Sam,” James said, quietly.</p><p>“I know that,” she said.</p><p>It was always a question of intention. “What are your intentions, sir?” Melinda had said playfully, when James reached underneath her shirt for the first time. The truth was that he had no idea why, at that particular moment, his hands had moved where they did. It wasn’t as if he’d said to himself, “Now I’m going to feel her up,” but, suddenly, there were his fingers, playing across the lace of her bra, and then there was his palm pressing against her hardening nipple. There had been no motive, only a kind of thoughtless lurch toward the next thing. Which is what his life had been ever since he was nine years old. The first few years after the accident (his mother’s term for it—spoken insistently to the 911 operator—had stuck) had not been difficult; in fact, he’d sometimes had the sense that teachers and even other parents were too easy on him, excusing a bad grade or a poorly pitched ball, as if they felt sorry for him. High school was different, though. Teen-agers were alternately curious and cruel, and he spent the four years skulking through hallways, head bent, shoulders hunched, a baseball cap pulled low. Girls were out of the question. That would have involved a kind of intimate scrutiny he could not even imagine. After he graduated, he spent a year smoking pot and reading in the basement of his mother’s house, with no plan other than to do more of the same, until she told him he had to pay rent or move out.</p><p>He was not especially driven to work construction, but he had amassed a nearly professional collection of tools, and he was willing to be paid under the table. He was relieved to find that the other men on the crew didn’t know his history and didn’t care to, that they didn’t, in fact, want to talk to him at all, except to occasionally complain about how slow he was cutting rebar. It was only after he’d asked the foreman for some of the remaindered wood and crafted a single chair and a table small enough for a person not to feel lonely when sitting alone, and only after a guy who was starting a chain of coffee shops happened to drive by as the newly stained chair and table were drying outside the dismal first-floor efficiency apartment he had rented, that the narrow aperture of his life opened up.</p><p>He woke, certain that Freddie had been in his dream, although<span data-page="page_4"></span> he could not fetch up a narrative and was left only with the exhausted sense of having not completed a necessary task. Melinda was sleeping on her back, as she always did, the even rise and fall of her chest untroubled. He stared at her profile, the line of her nose, the pinprick pores of her skin. She trusted him not to hurt her. She’d said that when they’d agreed to marry. They had been in another bed then, the ring box lying between them like an open jaw. He knew that she was talking about fidelity—her father had cheated on her mother—but he wondered if she’d meant other kinds of injury as well.</p><p>Freddie’s family had moved out of the neighborhood a few years after the accident. James had watched from his bedroom window as the moving van pulled away from the curb. He was too ashamed to join the other neighbors who had wandered out of their homes to say goodbye, because he had never done what he’d meant to do, which was to speak to Mrs. Connolly. At the funeral, when he and his mother had stopped to offer their condolences, Mrs. Connolly had reached out her gloved hand and touched James’s face. The feel of the cold leather on his cheek had frightened him. He saw, through her honeycombed veil, that her eyes were darting back and forth with indecision, as if she were unsure whether to comfort him or slap him. During the service, his mother cried. He did not cry, although he had the feeling that people were watching to see if he would. The idea of going to talk to Mrs. Connolly occurred to him afterward. He thought that if she could finally make up her mind about him, then he would understand how to live the rest of his life. But time passed, and what might once have been a natural thing to do became awkward. And there was the levelling effect of the semantics that everyone had somehow agreed upon, in an effort to preëmpt the possibility of a deeper undoing. It was an “accident” to spill a glass of milk or fall off your skateboard and twist your ankle. You didn’t cross over three front lawns to apologize for that.</p><p>Freddie had pointed out the tracks first. He knew they were deer markings because his father had taught him a few things in preparation for the day when he would finally take Freddie hunting. The boys followed the markings through the trees to the edge of the ravine. They slid down the embankment on their bottoms, then picked their way across the stream on a path of loose stones, slipping here and there so that their canvas sneakers filled with icy water. Using rocks and exposed roots as handholds, they pulled themselves up onto flat land, but there the trail disappeared. They spent the next few Saturdays outside, fashioning bows and arrows out of branches and calling each other by invented Indian tracker names. Freddie must have mentioned their games to his father, because, before the season was over, Mr. Connolly invited James to join them for Freddie’s inaugural hunt.</p><p>“I’m not sure how your father would feel about that,” his mother said dubiously, when he asked for permission.</p><p>“What’s he got to do with it?” James said. By this time his father had married a woman named Joyce, and they had a new baby.</p><p>“He’s still your father,” she said vaguely. She had taken a part-time job as a secretary at a real-estate office, where she had real responsibilities, as she reminded her children when their demands became overwhelming and she needed to go to her room and lie down. Still, James would often catch her glancing at the telephone as if she were waiting for his father to call and tell her that he would be late and that they should just “go ahead,” the way he used to do, as if she were unable to inhabit her future without his approval.</p><p>Finally, after much cajoling, she agreed, and James, carrying a worn sleeping bag and a mess kit cobbled together from his sister’s plastic kitchen set, joined Mr. Connolly and Freddie beside the Ram Charger parked in Freddie’s driveway.</p><p>Red of hair and face like his son, Mr. Connolly was talkative on the drive, telling the story of how he’d once tracked a deer for seven hours before bagging it. “Buck just folded up its legs and went down graceful. It was a beautiful sight to behold,” he said, narrowing his eyes as if he could see the scene on the road ahead. He advised the boys that they needed to think like an animal in order to know what it would do next.</p><p>“We’re all wild creatures, aren’t we?” Mr. Connolly said. “It’s just that our whole instinct business has gone to pot. Now all anybody wants is a nice comfortable chair and a TV. You got a comfortable chair and ‘Wheel of Fortune’ and you think you’ve got it made. Right, Freddie?”</p><p>Freddie, sitting between his father and James, did not answer. Mr. Connolly put a thick hand on his son’s narrow thigh. “Well, Freddie likes his TV, that’s for sure,” he said. “What do you think, Jimmy?”</p><p>“I guess,” James said, not entirely sure what the question was. “My<span data-page="page_5"></span> mom watches that show sometimes.”</p><p>“Well, there’s no TV where we’re heading. No TV at all.”</p><p>Once they arrived at the campground, James and Freddie helped Mr. Connolly set up the tent, then collected kindling for the fire. Mr. Connolly was very impressed when James invented a contraption, using a rain slicker and ropes, that could haul more wood out of the forest than either boy could manage on his own.</p><p>“Your pal’s a thinker, Freddie,” he said, tapping his son’s forehead with his finger.</p><p>James felt proud, but also concerned that Mr. Connolly was suggesting that such a smart boy as James might not want a friend who watched television, a friend like his son. The confusion made James nervous around the man, and that night he worked hard to tend the fire and scour the pots they’d used to cook the baked beans. After dinner, the boys watched Mr. Connolly clean his hunting rifle. He showed them how to load it and let each boy have a try before he returned the torpedo-shaped shells to their box. They slept in the tent, Mr. Connolly lying between the two boys. James was careful to face away so that there would be no possibility of his rolling into the man, or, worse, curling up to him as he had with his father on the occasions when he’d had a bad dream and had been allowed into his parents’ bed.</p><p>The next day, Mr. Connolly woke them early and gave them each a water canteen, a chocolate bar, and an orange vest to hang over their jackets. He warned them not to speak and to follow him in single file at all times. “You never want to walk in front of a man with a loaded gun,” he said. “Simple logic, right, Jimmy?”</p><p>Freddie followed his father, and James fell in behind. It was still cold, and, while Freddie had been outfitted with what looked to be a new wool hunting jacket, James had only a sweatshirt under his windbreaker. His face and the tips of his fingers began to sting. Every so often, Mr. Connolly would point at scat on the ground or at a cluster of leaves that James thought must be a sign of recent animal activity. Or he might simply stop, cock his head, and listen to something. James tried to distinguish animal noises from those of the birds and the sound of the breeze in the trees, but he guessed he was like the people Mr. Connolly complained about, the ones who had lost their instinct. They had not eaten breakfast and James began to feel the kind of nausea he associated with being starving in math class with two periods left before lunch. He put his hand on the chocolate bar in his pocket, but realized that it would be impossible to open the wrapper without making noise. He felt a blister start up on his heel and, remembering Mr. Connolly’s story, he worried that they would have to walk for seven hours or more.</p><p>Mr. Connolly stopped suddenly, then quickly fell into a crouch and lifted the rifle. When the boys followed suit, he put out a warning hand to stop their movement. James did not know whether to sink the rest of the way to the ground or stand back up, so he remained in a half-squat. He tried to see in front of Freddie and Mr. Connolly to whatever the man was aiming at, but his legs were shaking from his awkward stance and he thought if he moved he might fall over. In the silence, he became aware of Freddie’s breathing. Air moving through the obstacle course of Freddie’s throat and nose created an undertone that, as James concentrated on it, became as relentless and as deafening as the buzz of a broken fluorescent light. He tapped Freddie on the shoulder. Freddie turned, opening his mouth to speak, but what came out was an exhale of mucus that seemed more pronounced for having been suppressed for so long, and at the same time the gun fired, the crack and shock sending James sprawling. He heard the swoop of birds’ wings as they cleared the trees, and Mr. Connolly roaring “God damn it!,” as he bounded ahead, his rifle pushing aside branches, which then smacked Freddie and James in the face as they ran to keep up. By the time Mr. Connolly stopped, Freddie was crying. Mr. Connolly looked at his son for a moment, but his gaze seemed unfocussed, as if he were seeing not Freddie’s distress but the whole series of mistakes that had led to this moment, in which his only son was sobbing in the woods, snot running thickly from his nose.</p><p>When they returned to the camp, Mr. Connolly instructed the boys to take down the tent. The sun fell early, and most of the drive home was illuminated only by the truck’s headlights bouncing off the thick fog.</p><p>“Are we there yet?” Freddie asked, when they had been driving for nearly three hours without speaking.</p><p>Mr. Connolly pulled over to the side of the road and stopped. “Yes. We’re here. Get out.” He waited with the engine running while the dumbfounded boys struggled into their jackets and hats, but Mr. Connolly laid a hand on James’s arm. “Not you,” he said.</p><p>“It’s O.K.,” James said, seeing<span data-page="page_6"></span> the look of alarm on Freddie’s face. “I’ll go, too.”</p><p>“I didn’t tell you to get out,” Mr. Connolly said. “I told Freddie to get out.”</p><p>Without a word, Freddie stepped out of the truck. The door was barely shut when Mr. Connolly pulled back onto the road.</p><p>It took no more than ten minutes for Mr. Connolly and James to arrive back on their street, but James waited on his front porch for a full hour before he saw Freddie’s small, dark figure coming down the sidewalk. James met him and they walked together to the Connolly front door. They parted without saying goodbye.</p><p>Marco was expelled from school.</p><p>“Suspended,” Melinda corrected, when James phoned her office. It was ten in the morning. The school secretary had called and said that Marco needed to be picked up immediately.</p><p>“That makes it better?” he said. “What kind of a preschool kicks children out?”</p><p>When he arrived at the school, Marco was in the hallway, sitting quietly on a bench beside the classroom assistant, Angela. He looked like a person waiting at a Greyhound station. After James had hugged him and reassured him that everything was O.K., he told him to wait for a few more minutes.</p><p>He opened the classroom door. Mrs. Willing sat on the floor, reading a book to a gathering of children who lay against her side and across her lap and lolled on pillows strewn around her as if they were enjoying a Roman bath. She did not stop reading when she noticed James, so he walked closer and hovered over the group like an impatient diner waiting for a table to open up. Eventually, Mrs. Willing closed her book and instructed the children to begin a different activity.</p><p>“I’m sure you can see that it is disruptive when a parent walks in without an appointment,” she said, as she led James into the kitchenette attached to the classroom. Two trays lined with Dixie cups sat on the counter. She began to fill the cups with Goldfish crackers from a giant jar.</p><p>“Being called to come and pick up my kid at ten in the morning without any explanation is disruptive,” James said.</p><p>“Marco bit Sam,” Mrs. Willing said.</p><p>“You kick a kid out of nursery school because he got into a little fight?”</p><p>“There was no fight. The boys weren’t even playing together. Marco walked up to Sam and bit him.”</p><p>James was momentarily speechless. “What is it between Marco and that kid?” he said, his voice faltering.</p><p>“Sam is a very peaceful boy,” she said.</p><p>“And Marco is what?”</p><p>“I can give you the name of a doctor some parents have consulted.”</p><p>“A psychiatrist? You think Marco needs a shrink?”</p><p>“I think we need to discuss, at another time, how best to handle the situation. For now, I’d appreciate it if you’d take him home. Marco understands that this is an appropriate consequence of his action.”</p><p>James wanted to grip Mrs. Willing by her doughy shoulders and shake her.</p><p>She lifted up the full tray. “And I need Angela to help me with snack time.”</p><p>“Leave some for the kids,” James said.</p><p>That day, James was scheduled to make the two-hour drive to the factory. Rather than cancel, he decided to take Marco with him. It was clear that the boy was confused to be out of school when he should have been singing “The Wheels on the Bus” and fitting together cardboard puzzle pieces. James wondered how Mrs. Willing had acted in the moment. Had she said, in sweetly non-threatening tones, “I’m going to say it’s not O.K. to bite Sam”? Or had she simply yelled at Marco? He was upset to think that Marco might have suffered shame or embarrassment in front of his friends. James’s distress turned to anger, and he pulled over at a gas station, ostensibly to fill up, but while he was out of the car he called Melinda.</p><p>“That woman is a first-class bitch,” he said, when she came to the phone.</p><p>“Can Marco hear you?”</p><p>“No, Marco can’t hear me. What do you think I am?”</p><p>“I think you’re angry.”</p><p>“Aren’t you?”</p><p>“Yes, of course I’m angry. I’m upset.”</p><p>“You don’t sound like it. You don’t sound like anything.”</p><p>“What’s that supposed to mean?”</p><p>But he didn’t know what he meant, only that it felt good to lash out, to accuse her of something, of anything, even if it meant that he would have to apologize later. Neither he nor Melinda said anything for a long time, and he listened to the strange vacuum of sound that the cell phone delivered when no one was speaking, a technological absence that felt annihilating.</p><p>“Are you there?” he said, finally.</p><p>“How is he?” she said.</p><p>James bent down and peered at Marco through the car window. “Quiet. Weirdly quiet.”</p><p>“We’ll get past this,” she said. “And then it will be just something that happened.”</p><p>“Do you believe that?”</p><p>“Of course I do,” she said. “Nobody died.”</p><p>At the factory, the secretary made a fuss over Marco. She gave him a butterscotch candy from the bowl on her desk and insisted on taking him on a tour of the factory. She and James led Marco from the loading dock, where the teak boards were piled high, past the loud machinery where the wood was cut and shaped,<span data-page="page_7"></span> all the way through to the station where the finished pieces were checked for faults. Marco was mesmerized by everything, but he was most entranced by the leftover scraps of raw wood that lay scattered on the ground.</p><p>“Would you like some to take home?” the secretary asked.</p><p>Marco’s face lit up for the first time that day. “Can I make something in your workshop?” he asked James, as the secretary went off in search of a bag.</p><p>“What will you make?”</p><p>“A spaceship.”</p><p>“Absolutely,” James said.</p><p>“Dad,” Marco said, his sandpaper voice low and serious. “My spaceship can fly to Jupiter.”</p><p>“I know it can,” he said.</p><p>The town where James had grown up was only half an hour away, and, on a whim, James drove there. He wanted to show Marco the place where he had imagined flying bicycles and other impossibilities. What was once a suburb of modest aluminum-sided homes was now part of an indeterminate sprawl, studded with warehouses and small industries that had taken advantage of the low rents. James drove down his old street and parked in front of his childhood home, which had been sold years ago, when his mother died. Nothing substantial had been done to alter the façade, but somehow the place looked unfamiliar.</p><p>“This is where I lived when I was your age, buddy,” he said, glancing into the rearview mirror, but Marco had fallen asleep in his car seat, his head tilted to the side, his bag of woodchips clutched in his hand.</p><p>The Saturday after the hunting weekend, Freddie had showed up at the house as usual.</p><p>“Are you making something?” Freddie asked, when James’s mother called him down from his bedroom to greet the boy.</p><p>James shook his head. His father had come to take him and his siblings out for pizza earlier that week and had brought gifts, something he’d been doing since the new baby was born. He said that the gifts were from little June, and James was angry that he had to accept the preposterous suggestion that a baby could go out and buy toys. June had “given” James a set of Lego, but James didn’t see the point of following a series of steps that someone else had already decided upon so that he could end up with a firehouse that looked exactly like the one in the picture on the box.</p><p>“What do you want to do?” Freddie asked.</p><p>James put on his jacket and the boys went outside. They threw acorns at the side of the house for a while, then knocked down spiderwebs. When they grew tired of this, they crossed through the trees to the ravine. They sat on leaves that were still damp from the previous night’s rain, and tossed clods of dirt into the stream below.</p><p>James saw it first: a shadow among the trees across the water. When he looked more carefully, he could see nothing but leaves and branches, and yet he knew that something was different from what it had been just moments before. He was conscious of his breath moving in and out of his body, of the heaviness of his tongue in his mouth, of the coldness of his eyeballs in their sockets. And then one, two, three deer stepped out from behind the leaves. Their hides were the color of toast, their muzzles dappled with white. One of them was smaller than the others, its legs spindly and knobbed at the joints. The animals grazed, moving slowly here and there, poking their noses into bits of earth and brush. Suddenly Freddie stood up. James put a finger to his lips to quiet him, but the boy was already running back through the trees toward his house. It occurred to James that maybe Freddie was afraid of the wild animals and that this was why he had cried on the day of the hunt, but thoughts of his friend disappeared when one of the animals looked directly at him and seemed to observe him for a while. James was amazed and then proud that the deer was not spooked by his presence, that it did not perceive him as an enemy. And he was <em>not</em> an enemy; he resolved right then that he would never go hunting again. He was a creature, just like Mr. Connolly had said. He was a creature, alone with other creatures.</p><p>He turned at the sound of footsteps behind him, holding out his hand to stop whoever it was from coming closer and scaring off the deer, but Freddie kept walking, and James realized that he was carrying Mr. Connolly’s hunting rifle. “What are you doing?” James whispered, when Freddie was by his side. The boy kneeled down and positioned the rifle against his shoulder. The heavy butt wavered as he tried to steady it. He cocked the gun. James yelled and waved his arms wildly in order to warn the deer, but they did not move. He grabbed the rifle, but Freddie held onto it with a strength that James had not expected and the two boys began to wrestle with the gun between them, pushing and pulling at each other.</p><p>“Who’s there?” It was a man’s voice. “Freddie, is that you?”</p><p>Mr. Connolly ran through the trees, his big body thrashing against the low branches. He was barefoot and dressed in pajamas. “Son!”<span data-page="page_final"></span> he yelled. “Put down the gun! Do not move!”</p><p>James used the opportunity of Freddie’s surprise to yank the rifle away from him just as it fired. The shot deafened him, and he heard nothing as Mr. Connolly fell to the ground.</p><p>After they had put Marco to bed, Melinda and James sat together at the kitchen table, a bottle of wine open between them. Melinda was crying softly. Right before they had turned off Marco’s light, he’d asked if he was going to go to school the following day. They’d had to tell him no.</p><p>“I hate that school,” Melinda said. “I hate that Mrs. Wilson. Willing.” She covered her face, embarrassed by the disorganization of her feelings.</p><p>“We’re pulling him out of there,” James said, pouring more wine into their glasses. “We’ll find another school, where kids can hit and bite and draw blood,” he said. “We’ll find a school with a pro-war curriculum.”</p><p>“The only other preschool here is called Happy Valley,” she said.</p><p>Neither of them laughed at the absurdity.</p><p>“You don’t think anything is wrong with him, do you?” she said.</p><p>He looked at her for a moment, trying to fathom her meaning. “You know there’s nothing wrong with him,” he said quietly.</p><p>Later, after she had gone to bed, he went to his workshop. He wasn’t sure why he was there, knew only that he would not be able to sleep. He wanted the morning to come so that the day’s events would become part of the past, wanted tomorrow and the day after that to provide a platform from which he could watch what had happened recede and lose its shape, becoming something named and manageable. He turned on the light above his worktable. He had not yet cut into the birch. Maybe it wouldn’t be their new dining-room table. He wondered if he could make it into a go-kart or a sled, if there was something he could fashion that would make his son remember this time differently. A lot of ifs. He snapped off the light. He was too tired and too drunk to work, and, anyway, the sound of machinery might wake up Marco, who deserved some peaceful sleep before confronting another day of adults spouting platitudes and avoiding the truth.</p><p>The truth was this: there had been a moment in the woods, after he’d wrenched the gun from Freddie’s grasp, when James had felt his finger slide into the smooth, ear-like curve of the trigger, when he’d felt the snug rightness of his body in the world, the way he had when he’d pedalled his winged bike toward the edge of the ravine, going faster and faster until what was impossible had become possible and there was no more reason to think or doubt. And then there had been the split second when his instinct had kicked in, but it was too late.</p><p>He stood at the open doorway of his workshop, facing the house. The light in his and Melinda’s bedroom was off. She would be asleep now, lying on her back, her arms resting by her sides. The gun had fired. Or he had fired the gun. Which was it? This was the question he’d seen in Mrs. Connolly’s eyes through the scrim of her funeral veil. Soon he would slip into bed and watch the certainty of his wife’s sleep and wonder again if he knew the answer. ♦</p>	Marisa Silver	December 17, 2012 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/12/17/creatures	Accidents	Boys	Children	Fathers	Friends	Guns	James	Third	Children
Dogs Go Wolf	<p>The storm came and erased the quiet.</p><p>Well, the older sister thought, an island is never really quiet. Even without the storm, there were waves and wind and air-conditioners and generators and animals moving out there in the dark.</p><p>What the storm had erased was the silence from the other cabin. For hours, there had been no laughing, no bottle caps falling, none of the bickering that the girls had grown used to over the past two days.</p><p>This was because there were no more adults. They’d been left alone on the island, the two little girls. Four and seven. Pretty little things, strangers called them. What dolls! Their faces were exactly like their mother’s. Hoochies-in-waiting, their mother joked, but she watched them anxiously from the corner of her eye. She was a good mother.</p><p>The fluffy white dog had at least stopped his yowling. He had crept close to the girls’ bed, but when they tried to stroke him he snapped at their hands. The animal was torn between his hatred of children and his hatred of the wild storm outside.</p><p>The big sister said, Once upon a time, there was a—</p><p>—princess, the little sister said.</p><p>Rabbit, the big sister said.</p><p>Rabbit princess, the little sister said.</p><p>Once upon a time, there was a tiny purple rabbit, the older sister said. A man saw her and scooped her up in his net. Her family tried to stop him, but they couldn’t. The man went into the city and took the rabbit to a pet store and put her into a box in the window. All day long people stuck their hands in to touch the purple rabbit. Finally, a girl came in and bought the rabbit and took her home. It was better there, but the rabbit still missed her family. She grew and slept with the girl in her bed, but most days she stared out the window all sad. She began to forget that she was a rabbit. One day, the girl put a leash on the rabbit and they went out into the park. The rabbit looked up and saw another rabbit staring at her from the edge of the woods. They looked at each other long enough for her to remember that she was not a girl but a rabbit, and the other rabbit was her own sister. The girl was kind to her and gave her food, but the rabbit looked at her sister and she knew that this was her only chance. She slipped out of the collar and ran as fast as she could over the field, and she and her sister hopped into the forest. The rabbit family was so happy to see her. They had a party, dancing and singing and eating cabbage and carrots. The end.</p><p>The little sister was asleep. The two fishing cabins rocked on their stilts, the dock ground against the shore, the wind spoke through the cracks in the window frames, the palms lashed, the waves shattered and roared. The older girl held her little sister.</p><p>All night, she and the island were awake, the island because it never slept, the girl because she knew that only her ferocious attention would keep them safe.</p><p>Before they were left alone in the fishing camp on the island in the middle of the ocean, there had been Smokey Joe and Melanie. They were strangers to the girls. He wore a red bandanna above his eyebrows. Her shirts couldn’t hold in all her flesh.</p><p>The older girl knew that the two adults were nervous, because they didn’t stop smoking and arguing in hushed voices while the girls watched “Snow White” over and over. It was the only tape they’d brought. In the afternoon, Smokey Joe took the girls on a walk to the pond at the center of the island. It was a weird place. Beyond the sandy bay where the dock and the cabin were, the land grew rough with a kind of spongy stone and the trees seemed shrunken and bent by the wind.</p><p>Watch out, he told them. A Hollywood movie had been made here a long time ago and some monkeys had escaped. You come close, they’ll rip your hair out and steal your food from your bowl and throw poop at your head. He was joking, maybe. It was hard to tell.</p><p>They didn’t see any monkeys, though they did see huge black palmetto bugs, a rat snake sunning itself on the sandy path, long-necked white birds that Smokey Joe called ibises.</p><p>In the cabin, Melanie gave them hamburger patties without ketchup or buns and told them not to touch the dog because he was a mean little sucker. The younger sister didn’t listen, and suddenly her forearm was bleeding. Melanie shrugged and said, Told you. The older girl got one of their mother’s Maxi Pads from her dopp kit and wrapped it, sticker side out, around her sister’s arm.</p><p>Smokey Joe sat outside all afternoon under the purple tree with its nubby green-banana fingers. He was listening to his CB radio. Then he stood up and shouted for Melanie. Melanie ran out, her breasts and belly moving in all kinds of directions under her shirt. The older sister heard Smokey Joe say, Safer to leave ’em.</p><p>Melanie poked her head into<span data-page="page_2"></span> the cabin. She was pale under her orangey tan.</p><p>She said, Stay here. If someone shows up, don’t you go with no man. Girls, listen to me. Stay here, be good. I’ll send a lady to get you in a few hours.</p><p>The girls went outside and watched Smokey Joe and Melanie running down the dock. Melanie was screaming for the dog, but the dog stood still and didn’t follow her. And then Joe threw off the lines and Melanie jumped into the boat, almost missing it. One leg dangled in the water, then she lifted it over the side and they took off at full speed.</p><p>Before that, exactly one day before Smokey Joe and Melanie left the girls alone on the island, their mother had come to them in their own cabin, and she was dressed all fancy and smelled like a garden. Her boyfriend Ernesto and she were going out in Ernesto’s boat, she said. We’ll only be gone for an hour or two, honey bears. She pressed them close to her, her face made up with blue eyeshadow, her eyelashes so thick and long that it was a wonder she could see. She left red kisses on their cheeks.</p><p>But the hours clicked by and she didn’t come back at all. When night fell, the girls had to sleep on the floor in Melanie and Smokey Joe’s cabin, and Melanie and Smokey Joe whispered behind their bedroom door all night.</p><p>And, two days before that, their mother had come into the girls’ room in Fort Lauderdale in the middle of the night and thrown a few of their things into a bag and said, We’re going on a boat ride, pretties! Ernesto’s going to make us rich, and she laughed. Their mother was so beautiful she just glinted off light. Before the sun was even up, they were on Ernesto’s boat, going fast through the dark. And then they’d come to this little island, and the adults had talked all day and all night in the other cabin, and their mother had seemed wild on the inside, flushed on the outside.</p><p>And before Ernesto, many nights before him, their mother would come home very late, jangling. She usually made dinner for the girls, then left the older girl in charge of getting her sister’s teeth brushed and reading her to sleep. The older girl never slept in her own bed, always just stayed beside her sister until their mother was home. Sometimes, when the mother came in, she would get the girls up in their nightgowns, the night still in the windows, and sprinklers spitting in the courtyard, and she’d smell of vodka and smoke and money, and would put music on too loud and they’d all dance. Their mother would smoke cigarettes and fry up eggs and pancakes that she’d top with strawberry ice cream. She’d talk about the other women she worked with. Idiots, she called them. Skanks. She didn’t trust other women. They were all backstabbing bitches who’d rob you sooner than help you. She liked men. Men were easy. You knew where you were with men. Women were too complicated. You always had to guess. You couldn’t give them an inch or they’d ruin you, she said.</p><p>Before they came to Fort Lauderdale’s blazing sun they had been in Traverse City, where the older girl remembered only cherries and frozen fingers.</p><p>Before Traverse City, San Jose with its huge aloe plants and the laundromat below their apartment chugging all day.</p><p>Before San Jose, Brookline, where the little sister came to them in a tiny blanket of blue and pink stripes, a cocked hat.</p><p>Before Brookline, Phoenix, where they lived with a man who may have been the little sister’s father.</p><p>Before Phoenix, she was too small to remember. Or maybe there was nothing.</p><p>The morning was painfully clear. Once, at Goodwill, the mother had found a glass that she rang with a fingernail, and the glass sang in a high and perfect voice. The sunlight was like that after the storm.</p><p>There was nobody to tell them not to, so they ate grape jelly with spoons for breakfast. They watched “Snow White” on the VCR again.</p><p>The dog whimpered at the door. He had a little pad in the bathroom where he did his business. Melanie’s so damn lazy, their mother had muttered when she first saw the pad. What a lazy bitch. But maybe, the older sister thought, the dog just needed a little air. She got up and put his pink leash on, and let him out. The dog went down the steps so fast that he pulled the leash out of her hand. He looked back at the girl, and she could see the gears turning in his head, then he sped off into the woods. She called for him, but he wouldn’t come.</p><p>She went inside and didn’t tell her sister what had happened. It wasn’t until dinner—tuna fish and crackers and cheese—that the little sister looked around and said, Where’s the dog?</p><p>The older sister shrugged and said, I think he ran off.</p><p>The little sister started crying, and both girls went outside with a bowl of water and a can of tuna and opened it and called and called for the dog. He trotted out of the forest. There were sticks in his fur and<span data-page="page_3"></span> mud on his belly, but he looked happy. He wouldn’t come near the girls, only growled until they went inside, and then watched them through the screen door as he gulped down his food. The older sister lunged out the door and tried to grab his leash, but he was too fast and disappeared again.</p><p>The little girl stopped crying only when her sister brought out Melanie’s cookies. Don’t you touch my damn Oreos, she’d said to them, but she wasn’t around to yell now. They ate them all.</p><p>Late at night, there was a terrible grinding sound and the girls went outside with flashlights and looked at the air-conditioning unit, and saw that a brown snake had fallen into it from the palm trees; with every turn of the blade, a millimetre more of the snake was being eaten by the fan. They watched the snake dissolve bit by bit until the skin fell all the way through and lay, empty of meat, on the ground.</p><p>The girls woke up sticky and hot. The air-conditioning had died sometime before dawn.</p><p>The older one thought the snake had gummed things up, but nothing was working—no lights, no water pump, no refrigerator—and then she understood that it was the generator. She went out back and kicked it. She found a hole where the gas went in and looked inside with her flashlight.</p><p>We runned out of gas, she told her sister, who was sucking her fingers again, the way she had when she was a baby.</p><p>Fix it, the little sister said, I’m so hot. But they looked and looked and there was no more fuel. When the older sister tried to flush the toilet, it wouldn’t flush. When the cabin started to smell from the toilet and the dog’s pad, they moved back to the other cabin, where their mother’s stuff was still in the closets and on the dresser. They began going to the bathroom outside.</p><p>There was no food in their cabin, so they took everything they could find from Melanie and Smokey Joe’s. Frozen peas, which they ate like popcorn, one Hungry-Man TV dinner, which they opened and left out for the dog. A block of cheese and yellow mustard. White bread, more cheese in a spray can, a can of beans. Bourbon and cigars that smelled like a spice drawer.</p><p>In the afternoon, they put on their mother’s clothes, her makeup. They looked like tiny versions of her, both of them, though the little sister didn’t need to go in the sun to be tanned.</p><p>The older sister read everything she could to her little sister. There was one fat book, yellow and swollen, on Melanie’s nightstand. It had a man on the cover with an axe over his shoulder but no shirt. She read the cereal box she dug out of the garbage. She read the old magazines on the coffee table.</p><p>The older girl understood that there was no more water only when they were thirsty and she tried to turn on the faucet. She ignored her thirst for a long time, until her throat felt stuffed with cotton and the little girl wouldn’t stop complaining.</p><p>It was going to be dark in a half hour or so. The sun was burning at the edge of the ocean.</p><p>The older sister sighed. I think we have to walk to the pond, she said.</p><p>The little sister started to cry. But the monkeys, she said.</p><p>We’ll make lots of noise. They won’t bother us if we’re together, the older sister said, and they walked very fast, hand in hand, to the pond, and it was twilight when they got back. The girls saw a white flash in the woods, and the little one was so frightened that she dropped her bucket and spilled half her water, and she ran all the way back to the cabin, slamming the door. The older sister cried with rage and carried the buckets back by herself. Out of meanness, she wouldn’t let her little sister drink the water until she’d put it in a saucepan and set it over the charcoal grill to boil, which took a very, very long time, until the moon was fat and bright in the sky.</p><p>In the morning, the older girl took out her sister’s braids and the little one’s hair fluffed out into a beautiful dark cloud.</p><p>They took the only knife, a steak knife, and whittled points into the ends of sticks, and they went into the chilly shallow water to fish, because they’d have to find food soon. But the water was so nice and the fish were so little that they abandoned the spears and swam all morning.</p><p>They painted their fingernails with polish they found in Melanie’s medicine cabinet. Then they painted their toenails, then tattoos of hearts on their biceps, which made their skin itch until they scratched the hearts off.</p><p>They found a candy bar in a nightstand, then a dirty magazine under Smokey Joe’s bed. A woman was licking a pearl off another woman’s pink private skin.</p><p>Yuck, the older sister said and threw the magazine, but the younger sister made the noises the mother made when she was in her bedroom with her boyfriends. Then she started crying. At first she only shook her head when her sister asked her why. Finally<span data-page="page_4"></span> she said, I miss the dog.</p><p>Nobody could miss that dog, the older sister thought.</p><p>How could Melanie leave him? the little sister said.</p><p>Then the older sister thought, Oh.</p><p>Let’s go on a dog hunt, she said.</p><p>They took the steak knife, binoculars, an old whiskey bottle with the last of their boiled water, and a giant panama hat they’d found in a closet, which the older sister wore because she burned to blisters all the time. They took the rest of the crackers and sprayed themselves with the last of Melanie’s Skin So Soft bug spray.</p><p>The little sister was happy again. It was early afternoon. There was no wind, and the heat of the clearing cooled when they went into the forest. They sang the dog’s name, walking. The older sister nervously scanned the branches for monkeys.</p><p>The pond held a great gray heron, unmoving, like a sculpture. There were cypress knees, like stalagmites, in the shallows.</p><p>On the far side of the pond, there was a small wooden rowboat turned upside down. It was a flaking blue. The older sister kicked it, wondering how to drag it through the forest toward the cove and the dock. Then she wondered how she would make sure, once they’d launched it, that they floated toward land, and not into the deep-blue sea. Maybe it was best just to wait for the lady Melanie was supposed to send.</p><p>When she looked up, her little sister had vanished. Her heart dropped out of her body. She called her sister’s name, then screamed it over and over.</p><p>She heard a laugh from below, and her sister slid out from under a lip of rock that made a shallow invisible cave. That was so mean, the older sister yelled, and the little sister shrugged and said, Sorry, though she wasn’t.</p><p>There could’ve been snakes there, the older sister said.</p><p>But there weren’t, the little one said.</p><p>They walked all the way across the island and found a yellow-sand beach on the other side. Their dresses were soaked with sweat when they got back to the pond and filled the whiskey bottle up with green water.</p><p>Back in the fishing camp, the dog was waiting on the steps. The girls poured out unboiled water for him, and the dog lapped it up, watching them with his angry black-button eyes. Even though the little sister sang softly to him in her voice that their mother always said would knock the angels out of Heaven, the dog wouldn’t come near, and backed into the forest again.</p><p>The girls’ clothes were so dirty that they put on Smokey Joe’s last two clean T-shirts. They swept the path behind the girls like ball gowns when they ran, flashes of red and blue through the green-gold forest.</p><p>The little sister carried her bucket all the way back from the pond without complaining.</p><p>They caught three crabs under the dock with their hands and boiled them, and the flesh tasted like butter, and the water they boiled the crabs in they drank like soup, and afterward they felt full for a little while.</p><p>Then the rest of the food was gone. The bananas on the tree, Smokey Joe had said, were not ripe yet and would make them sick if they tried to eat them. The older sister had heard of people eating bugs and there were plenty of cockroaches everywhere, but the thought of the crunch under her teeth made her feel ill.</p><p>They ate cherry ChapStick. They opened an unlabelled can they found in the back of the cabinet, mandarin oranges. They ate strange red berries from the bushes, though the mother had always said never to do that.</p><p>I’m hungry, the little sister said.</p><p>Once upon a time, the big sister said, there was a boy and a girl whose family had no food at all. You could see their ribs. The mother had a boyfriend who didn’t like the kids. One day, the boyfriend told the mother that they had to get rid of the kids and that he was going to take them for a hike and leave them way out in the woods. The girl had heard the adults talking that night, and in the morning she filled her pockets with cereal.</p><p>They weren’t starving if they had cereal, the little sister said.</p><p>The girl filled her pockets with blue pebbles from the fish tank. And when the boyfriend led them out into the woods she dropped the pebbles one by one by the side of the path, so that when he vanished they could find their way back. The boy and the girl followed the stones home, and the mother was so happy to see them. But the boyfriend grew angry. The next day, he took them out again, but he’d sewn up their pockets so they couldn’t leave a trail. He left them, and they wandered and wandered and found a cave to hide in for the night. The next morning they smelled wood smoke and followed it to find a little cabin out in the woods, made of cookies and candy. So they ran over and started taking bites out of the house, because they hadn’t eaten in a long time. A lady came out. She was nice to them, and she kept giving them cake<span data-page="page_5"></span> and mini pizzas.</p><p>And milk, the younger sister said. And apples.</p><p>There was a television. The lady didn’t even make them sit down to eat their food; they just lay there and watched cartoons and ate all day long. The boy and the girl got really fat. And when they were superfat the lady tied them up and tried to shove them into the oven like turkeys. But the girl was smart. She said, Oh, let me give you one last kiss! And the lady leaned her head forward, and the girl took a bite out of her throat. Because she’d become a champion eater at the lady’s house, she ate the lady all the way down until there was nothing left, not even blood. And the boy and the girl stayed all winter eating the cookie house, and when spring came they’d turned into adults. Then they went to find the boyfriend.</p><p>Why? the little sister said.</p><p>To eat him, the older sister said.</p><p>People eat people? the little sister said.</p><p>Sometimes you just have to, the big sister said.</p><p>No, the little sister said.</p><p>Fine. The lady was made of whipped cream, then, the older sister said. They never found the boyfriend. But they would have eaten him if they had.</p><p>The older sister’s head was gentle with clouds. The sand of the bay smelled like almonds to her. She was sitting alone by the charcoal grill, waiting for the water to boil. Her sister was inside, singing herself to sleep. She was happy, the older sister realized. Overhead was the thinning moon. Across the water came the squeak and rattle of some big birds with blood-red throats that were passing on their way to somewhere colder, somewhere larger, somewhere better than here.</p><p>There’s a man, the little sister said from the screen door.</p><p>There’s no man, the older sister said dreamily.</p><p>He’s in a boat. On the dock, the little sister said, and now the big sister could hear the purr of the motor. She stood up so fast that her head lost blood and she fell and then got to her knees and stood again.</p><p>Go, she whispered, and dragged her sister through the door, down the steps, into the woods.</p><p>They crouched in the ferns, and the ferns covered them. They were naked, and the ground beneath their bare feet could have been full of snakes, lizards, spiders.</p><p>The man’s boots pounded down the dock. He came into view. He was stocky, with jeans and a sweaty T-shirt, a thick gold chain around his neck. The older sister knew—something whispered silently to her—that he was in fact a bad man.</p><p>Be quiet, the whisper said. Get away.</p><p>He went into the girls’ cabin and there were crashing noises; he went into Melanie and Smokey Joe’s cabin and again there were crashing noises. When he came out, he kicked over the grill, and the older girl put her hand over her sister’s mouth to keep her from crying out. He turned around slowly, looking into the woods.</p><p>Come on out, he shouted. He had an accent. I know you’re here.</p><p>He waited, and said, We got your mama with us. Don’t you want to see your mama? We’ll make you a big old feast and you can sit in her lap and eat it all up. Bet you’re hungry.</p><p>The older sister struggled to keep the little one from standing. The man must have heard, because his head swivelled in their direction.</p><p>Run, the older girl said, and they ran through the woods, the palmettos lashing at their ankles and making them bleed. They found the path, they found the pond.</p><p>The older girl slid into the cave near the boat, then her little sister came in, and she held her tightly.</p><p>Soon they heard the man’s footsteps crashing and his breath wheezing in and out, hard. Girls, he said, I saw you. I know you’re around here.</p><p>His boots came into view, so close. He moved toward the boat, and kicked it once, twice, then the girls saw the rotten wood break apart and a hundred frightened bugs ran out.</p><p>Fine, he said. Ain’t going to chase you all day. Starve to death if you like.</p><p>The girls were silent, shaking, until they heard his footsteps fading. After too long, they heard the boat start up, then the motor thinned and he was gone. Still, they waited.</p><p>There was a rustling at their feet, and the little dog slunk out of the cave, where he must have been hiding all this time, inches away. The girls watched him gather the pink leash in his mouth and trot himself off.</p><p>Where’s the lady? the little sister said. She’s taking a long time.</p><p>What lady? the older sister said.</p><p>The one to save us, the little sister said. That Melanie’s sending.</p><p>The older sister had forgotten there was supposed to be a lady. The girls were deep in their nest. They’d taken all the pillows and sheets in the camp and piled them in the middle of the living room of their cabin, where a breeze passed over their sweaty bodies on its way from the screen door out the window. It was late in the morning, but the girls’ bones didn’t want to get up. Lie still, the bones said. Their hearts made<span data-page="page_6"></span> music in their ears.</p><p>The older sister could almost see the lady now, coming down the dock. She’d wear a blue dress with a skirt so huge they could hide beneath it; she’d have their mother’s yellow hair that was dark at the roots. She’d smile down at them. Girls, she’d whisper. Come home with me.</p><p>They hadn’t eaten in three days. Somewhere not too far away, the white dog had howled all night until his howls sounded like wind. The older sister had dreamed of the courtyard of their Fort Lauderdale apartment, of the fountain’s turquoise water and the red-dyed cedar mulch and the tree heavy with sweet oranges that almost peeled themselves in your fingers, the golden sun pouring down over everything, all of it shimmering but untouchable, as if behind glass.</p><p>Night came, day came, night came.</p><p>The dog had gone silent. The little sister’s ribs were sharp beneath her skin. Her eyes were hot, the way their mother’s were hot when she came home from work, wanting to dance, smoke, sing.</p><p>The older sister’s body was made of air. She was a balloon, skidding over the ground. The light on the waves in the bay made her cry, but not with sadness. It was so beautiful, it wanted to speak to her; it was about to say something if she only watched hard enough.</p><p>The zip of a mosquito near her ear was a needling beauty. She let the mosquito land on her skin, and slowly it pulsed and pumped and she felt her blood rising up into the small creature.</p><p>It was all so much. Through the years to come, she’d remember these days of calm. She’d hold these beautiful soft days in her as the years slowly moved from terrible to bearable to better, and she would feel herself growing, sharpening. She’d learn the language of men and use it against them: she’d become a lawyer. Her little sister, so lovely, so fragile, only ever wanted to be held. For a long time, the older sister was the one who did this for her. She was the shell. But then the little sister met a man who first gave her love, then withdrew it until she believed the things he believed. He made her give up her last name, which the older sister had fought their whole childhood to keep, though their third foster parents had wanted to adopt them, because it was the only thing they had of their mother. And then one day the older sister stood in the pews and watched her baby sister get married to this man. She wore a white dress with a skirt so giant she could barely walk, and bound herself to him. The older sister watched and started to shake. She cried. An ugly wish spread in her like ink in water: that she and her sister had stayed on the island all those years ago; that they’d slowly vanished into their hunger until they turned into sunlight and dust.</p><p>Once upon a time, the older sister croaked, and the little sister whispered, No. Shush, please.</p><p>Once upon a time, the older sister said, there were two little girls made out of air. They were so beautiful that everyone who saw them wanted to scoop them up and put them into their pockets. One day, the god of wind saw them and loved them so much that he lifted them up and took them with him to the clouds to be his daughters. And they lived there forever with their father, and it was full of rainbows and people singing and good things to eat and soft beds made of feathers.</p><p>The end, the little sister said.</p><p>The younger sister dozed in the cabin. The older one let her body float above the path to the pond and back with water. There was no more charcoal, so they had to boil it over sticks she collected on the way back.</p><p>Twenty feet from the cabins, she heard the slightest of sounds. She peered into the palmettos and saw a glint of metal. She walked through the prickles and not one reached out to scratch her.</p><p>It was the dog. He had spun his leash so tightly around a scrub oak that his tongue was extended and his eyes bulged. He was no longer white fluff but knots of yellow and brown string.</p><p>The girl took the steak knife from her belt and knelt and sawed and sawed. She had to take breaks, because she kept getting dizzy. At last the leash broke and the dog stood and stumbled off into the underbrush again. There he would live forever, the girl knew. He would stay in that forest, running and howling and eating birds and fish and lizards. That dog was too mean to ever die.</p><p>She came back to find her sister naked outside the cabin, under the banana tree. Look, the little girl said, sucking her fingers.</p><p>The older sister looked but saw nothing. She did not see the unripe bananas like stubby fingers hanging down, which had been there when she went to get the water; she did not see the peels, which she would find later in the garbage.</p><p>There was a monkey, the little sister said. A tiny, tiny monkey. It had fingers like person fingers. It sat on<span data-page="page_final"></span> the roof and peeled the bananas and ate them all up.</p><p>The older girl looked at the little sister. She stared back with round eyes. There was a long silence, and something in the older sister turned away, even as she nodded.</p><p>All right, then. There was a monkey.</p><p>Now, over the wind, all the way across the pond, from the beach on the other side of the island, there came a noise the older sister caught, then lost, then caught again. It was a song their mother had often sung along to on the radio in the car. A song—that meant a radio. The older girl took her sister’s face in her hands. We got to get ready fast, she said. Then we got to run.</p><p>They scrubbed themselves in the waves and, wet, put on their mother’s dresses, the only clean things there were. Shifts in tropical patterns that came down below the older girl’s knees, to the younger one’s ankles; on their mother those dresses were so short you could sometimes see her underwear when she was sitting down. They poured her perfume all over their wrists and heads.</p><p>Then they ran. They stopped when they were still among the trees, breathing heavily.</p><p>There was a boat anchored not far out, and a rubber dinghy pulled up on the wet part of the sand and a fishing pole buried next to it. A woman lay on a blanket. She was white, though her shoulders and thighs were going pink. She was plump. She was mouthing along to a different song on the radio, her feet waggling back and forth in time.</p><p>There was a man beside the dinghy with his swimming trunks down to his knees. He was peeing, the girls saw. He didn’t even wash his hands in the waves, but went over to the woman and stooped and put them in a cooler for a minute, then popped them under the woman’s bikini bottom while she screamed and swatted at him.</p><p>He laughed and took a beer can from the cooler and opened it and drank deeply, and picked up a sandwich in waxed paper. The older sister’s mouth watered. She was glad when he crumpled the paper up and didn’t litter but put it neatly back into the cooler.</p><p>The older girl looked at her sister. She was wild. You could see all her bones. The older sister took the brown leaves out of the little one’s hair, brushed the dirt off her dress, took out their mother’s lipstick, which she’d put into her pocket as they ran out the door. She put lipstick on her sister’s lips, then made tiny circles on her cheeks. Now me, she ordered, and her little sister’s face pursed in concentration and the lipstick tickled on her own cheeks and lips.</p><p>She put the lipstick back into her pocket. She would keep the gold cartridge of it long after the makeup inside was gone and only a sweet waxy smell of her mother remained.</p><p>Ready? she said. Her sister nodded and took her hand. Together they stepped out of the shadows and onto the blazing beach.</p><p>The woman on the blanket looked up at them, then shaded her eyes with a hand to see better. Later the woman would visit the girls once, then disappear after she left the older sister a gift, a vision of how the sisters had looked just then: ghost girls in clown makeup and floral sacks, creeping out of the dark forest. The woman’s mouth opened and a cry of alarm stuck in her throat. She raised her arms in amazement. The girls took the gesture for a welcome. Though they were very tired and felt tiny under the angry sun, they ran. ♦</p>	Lauren Groff	August 28, 2017 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/08/28/dogs-go-wolf	Children	Dogs	Islands	Solitude	Wilderness		Unnamed	Third	Children
Eykelboom	<p>Where <span data-page="page_1"></span>had they come from, the Eykelbooms? The boys suspected Indiana, Illinois. Some crude and faceless Yankee state. The Eykelbooms had emerged and emigrated from it. It was a tiny, deeply threatening invasion. The boys watched them unpack their moving truck, which was actually a dump truck, their belongings piled into the bed and covered with a large heavy tarp. The truck belonged to Eykelboom’s father. No one else on the street owned a dump truck, and this might have been cool had the owner of the truck not been Eykelboom’s father.</p><p>They weren’t neighborly, of course, aside from Eykelboom himself, an only child, who tried to befriend the other boys, to no avail. His parents made no effort to help their son or to make any friends themselves. His mother almost never appeared outside the house, except for trips to the grocery store, and his father did only when he drove the dump truck to and from work, blowing his customized musical horn to announce his arrival, which everyone came to truly despise, or when he was mowing the grass on weekends. He did this shirtless, as if to show off his physique. He was tall, with a big rectangular head, a flattop haircut that wedged to a point over his small, square forehead, and droopy, arrogant eyes. Long loose limbs that looked apelike and strong, huge hands and feet, but thin and wiry legs as if he’d descended from a jackrabbit or some fleet herbivore. As he pushed the lawnmower back and forth across the grass, he sucked in his gut like a movie actor. You could always tell that it was sucked in because it wasn’t muscled, just smoothly concaved by the sucking. Eykelboom walked around doing the same thing, sucking in his belly, sticking out his chest, atop which stood the same long neck, slack face, flattop haircut. He was slighter and softer than his old man, gangly. He ran with his head thrown back, legs flailing, chest thrust forward as if to break the wire.</p><p>Eykelboom’s old man didn’t like Eykelboom much, either, which was a pretty awful thing, even to the boys.</p><p>The boys wore cutoff jeans and faded torn T-shirts, went barefoot or in begrimed old sneakers without socks. They had blackened fingernails and knuckles, tired-boy eyes, scarred knees and elbows and ears, snotty noses, unwashed hair spiked with sleep and itchy with sand, scabby stubbed toes, unbrushed teeth flecked with tomato peel and pieces of grass. They got around on foot or on one of a squad of banged-up bicycles that seemed interchangeable and were left crashed into shrubbery or tangled at the center of a forlorn front yard or askew in the street like the rusted remains of extinct, mechanized animals.</p><p>Eykelboom, neatly dressed, clean, quiet, was not a troublemaker, as far as the other boys could see. Yet every so often his father would come out of the house, call to him, and stand there waiting. Eykelboom’s face would blanch, he would freeze for a moment, then mutter something fatalistic and trudge over to his old man. Together they would turn and go into the house, and the boys wouldn’t see Eykelboom for a couple of days. They might see him being driven to school by his mother instead of taking the bus, but he never looked out the car window. At school, he kept his head down, staring at the book on his desk, sat alone in the cafeteria, and somehow disappeared at recess. Then one day he’d be back, attempting once again to be their friend. What he had done to bring down his father’s wrath no one knew. Some private transgression. But once the boys realized that they could use it against him they did.</p><p>Of course, it was common in those days for parents to hit their children, with everything from hairbrushes to toilet brushes, flyswatters, switches, bare palms, rolled newspapers, and folded belts. But, usually, there was a good and obvious reason.</p><p>The boys couldn’t be sure, but it seemed like Eykelboom’s old man did it just to do it, to keep the boy in check. Secretly, they envied him this. Their fathers were generally ineffective, weak. They were low-ranking white-collar, nervous, inattentive, soft, unhappy. In a way, they were not even there.</p><p>I’d like to see it, the older Harbour twin said. I’d like to watch.</p><p>That’s pretty sick, said Wayne, a brooding olive-skinned boy whose father was a temperamental judge whom everyone except Wayne seemed to fear. You’re a fucking freak, he said.</p><p>Wayne and the older twin wrestled, making high whining sounds, and then stopped when Wayne pinned the twin, who got up and walked off up the hill toward his house, sulking. Wayne stood there panting, looking after him. Then he stared for a while at Eykelboom’s house before heading off toward his own, without speaking to the other boys.</p><p>Eykelboom was not supposed to play in the big drainage ditch at the end of the street, down near the turnaround. It was not a cul-de-sac, as no one had ever heard the term. Plus a cul-de-sac should have houses rimming its perimeter, houses with neat yards and diagonally symmetrical lots, whereas one part of this turnaround was bordered by a bamboo-filled ravine; another by a dirt path that led to a small bass-and-bream lake infested with<span data-page="page_2"></span> water moccasins; and a third section opened up to a big new house with a low-lying front yard that filled with brown water every heavy rain. Just before you reached the turnaround, on the north side of the street, a buried storm drainpipe that ran from the top of the hill down to the bottom emptied out into the drainage ditch. The sandy earth there had eroded into a small gully that threatened to undermine the street itself. The boys built dams in the storm runoff that came from the pipe, dug treacherous caves into the sandy bank, hid in the ditch to lob dirt clods at cars that had come down their street by mistake, thinking it a throughway. Their parents didn’t worry about the ditch, believing that the boys had sense enough (they did not) to be careful and look out for themselves. But Eykelboom’s family was from someplace very different, and Eykelboom’s old man did not allow him to run loose. He was expressly forbidden to go into the big drainage ditch.</p><p>Nor was he allowed to run loose in the dense tract of virgin forest that began just behind the houses on the north side of the street. These woods were owned by a cantankerous old man named Chandler, who lived in an old plantation-style house perched on the edge of the woods as if he were the resident troll whose mission it was to guard them. Chandler had once owned the land under the boys’ houses, too, before the developer bought it from him and paved what had been a dirt road to the lake and built a dozen small ranch-style houses on a dozen small lots, six on either side of the street. At the end of the turnaround was the big house that the developer had built for himself.</p><p>When Eykelboom declined to go into the woods, the boys called him a coward and headed in without him. He stood in the street and watched them cross a vacant lot to the section of barbed-wire fence where they normally entered the woods. Then he called out, Wait, I’m coming, and rushed to join them.</p><p>There was a creek that ran the length of the woods. At its lowest point it widened into a series of waist-deep, muddied pools, creating a swamp. In the clear, shallow areas of the creek higher up, there were minnows and tadpoles, and crawfish to catch. But the pools were murky and more likely to harbor snakes and snapping turtles, so the boys avoided them.</p><p>They took Eykelboom on a tour of their main trails through the woods. They pointed out areas that even they hadn’t explored, then doubled back and showed him the layout of the creek from near its source down to the pools. When the boys saw that he was standing on a spot that had been weakened by the creek’s current, they exchanged glances but said nothing. The bank gave way and Eykelboom plunged into a pool up to his belly. The boys pulled him up, but he was inconsolable.</p><p>My dad’s going to kill me, he said.</p><p>Why don’t you just get wet all over, and you can say someone sprayed you with a hose? the older Harbour twin said.</p><p>It won’t work, Eykelboom mumbled. It won’t matter.</p><p>Why don’t you just go change before he gets home from work?</p><p>She’d tell him.</p><p>Well, someone else said, we’d better hide out in the ditch and hope you can dry in the sun before your old man comes home. [cartoon id="a18695"]</p><p>It was the younger (by five minutes) twin who said this. The twins were not identical. The younger one looked like a boring businessman shrunk to the size of a child. The older one was taller but as scrawny as a starved stray cur.</p><p>Eykelboom reminded them that the ditch would only make it worse. He looked like he was about to cry. A couple of the boys felt sorry for him, along with a vague annoyance.</p><p>Actually, Wayne said, the woods would be worse.</p><p>He seemed very calm. Eykelboom was bringing something out in Wayne.</p><p>It’s not just someplace you’re not supposed to be, Wayne said. It’s trespassing. We could all go to jail just for being here.</p><p>The boys looked at Wayne. They knew that the woods’ owner, Mr. Chandler, hated them because they built forts and camped out in there and of course made campfires, which meant that they could potentially start a forest fire and burn it all down. This was a small and pristine forest where some older boys swore they’d seen an ivory-billed woodpecker, supposedly extinct for longer than the boys’ parents had been alive. But the boys’ parents seemed to think nothing of their trespassing in Mr. Chandler’s woods. If they knew that Chandler hated the boys being in there, they showed no sign. Chandler sometimes used his shotgun when he detected the boys’ presence in his woods, striding into his great back yard and firing off loads of bird shot that pecked down through the broad low canopy of leaves like a shower of rain. Once the middle McGowen brother took a pellet on the pad of his pinkie finger. The finger stayed swollen for a week. His older brother advised him to say it was a bee sting.</p><p>Now, after Wayne’s words, the boys were<span data-page="page_3"></span> having visions of prosecution for trespassing, a previously unthinkable prospect. A squad of deputies would be dispatched to the woods to round them up and take them to juvie lockup, inking and logging their filthy little fingerprints, taking their urchinesque mug shots, interrogating them, hauling them to court, tossing them into some kind of Boys Town chaos of a prison.</p><p>Then Wayne said, There’s nothing else you can do. You have to go hide in the ditch. It’s too shady in here. You’ll dry out in the sun and your old man will never know.</p><p>The boys all knew he wouldn’t dry out there. It was a humid day. One of those days when their mothers had to leave the wash on the line for a second or third day to dry it fully. The boys knew that Eykelboom was fucked, either way, that it was just a brief matter of time before his old man would come home in his ridiculous vehicle, rolling down the hill blowing his ridiculous melodious horn as if everyone, as if anyone, would be delighted to know that he was home again, home again, and that as soon as he went into the house and said, Where’s Ikey? and Eykelboom’s mom said, I don’t know, he’s been out all afternoon with the other boys, Eykelboom’s old man would be out in the street himself, hands on his hips, so you could tell even with a T-shirt on that he was sucking in his gut to look like he did calisthenics and never ate anything other than raw lean meat, calling out Eykelboom’s name in a voice that said as clear as God’s that he was planning on putting some kind of hurt on Eykelboom.</p><p>They waited, squatting low, watching the dirty water trickle from the big pipe and down the drainage stream. Every few minutes one of them climbed up to peek over the rim of the ditch to see if a car was coming down the hill. On the far wall of the ditch were the ruins of the caves they’d built earlier in the summer. They’d built four of them. Wayne’s had been the most elaborate, with two chambers, the smaller just large enough for Wayne to crawl into and curl up like a baby. They’d come out one morning to find them all destroyed. Someone had taken a shovel and caved in the caves. Someone afraid that his child would be in there when the sandy soil above collapsed and smothered him. It could have been anyone, really, someone’s parent or even a city worker cruising by on inspection. But the boys knew it had been Eykelboom’s father. They imagined him sneaking down there in the middle of the night with a shovel and a flashlight. No one else had seemed to notice the caves. No one else hated the ditch. No one else was so aggressive. Their fathers did not take action. The boys’ fathers tended to ward off worldly trouble with idle, halfhearted swats as if at lazy bees. Eykelboom’s old man, although odd, even laughably weird, was potentially frightening, very humanly alive. They couldn’t even greet him, Hello, Mr. Eykelboom, without getting a smirk in return, as if they had tried to speak but had failed because they were retarded. Sometimes he even laughed at them. They were terrified of him. They wanted not to kill him but for something stronger than themselves to crush him.</p><p>As for Eykelboom’s mother, they knew nothing, although they assumed that she was at least somewhat like their own mothers, sometimes angry and sometimes sad, obsessed with the outrageous burden of housework and cooking, even if they had paying jobs as well. Women who rushed out of their back doors to smoke, pacing, on the patio or as far from the house as possible, who could not be spoken to until it was bearable for them to be in their lives again, which could take minutes, hours, or days.</p><p>A car came down the hill and the boys hunkered low. It whooshed past, fast and unseen, and turned in to the long drive of the developer’s house at the end of the turnaround. The developer and his wife zoomed up and down the street, and occasionally waved but never stopped. The boys had waved back when they were younger and the street was newer but they did not anymore. They realized that they were negligible. Occasionally someone’s dog or cat that lacked sense or agility was crushed beneath one of their big, sleek cars. The developer’s wife would come and apologize. She seemed gigantic, loud. Her teeth were enormous. They feared her. Like their parents, they toiled in the developer’s fields like serfs, outwardly quiet and obedient. They took out their need for violence upon one another.</p><p>After they heard the developer’s car door open and shut, they heard Eykelboom’s father’s dump truck turn onto their street. They heard it come over the top of the hill and slow with a throaty downshifting of gears, and heard the horn blow out its melody, the opening bar of “Dixie,” which was idiotic, not to mention deliberately provocative, given that he was from Indianaland. They heard the truck lunge into the Eykelbooms’ driveway and stop. They heard Eykelboom’s father get out and go into the house.</p><p>Eykelboom’s eyes in his long, heavy head<span data-page="page_4"></span> were wide open, limpid, staring at nothing. He squatted there very still, wet and steaming in the sultry heat. Then they all heard the Eykelbooms’ front door open and shut again. Eykelboom seemed to be holding his breath, his lips trembling. His father called out in a hard low tenor, a voice all the stranger for being rarely heard in regular speech.</p><p>Emile! he called. Emile!</p><p>He called Eykelboom Ikey only when he wasn’t mad.</p><p>Eykelboom closed his eyes, took a deep breath through his nose, and let it out.</p><p>I better go on up, he said.</p><p>Wayne said, Let’s sneak out the back way into the woods.</p><p>The boys looked at Wayne. He was looking at Eykelboom in a way that was meant to seem very casual but was actually very intense, as if no one else were there but Eykelboom and Wayne.</p><p>Eykelboom said, It’ll just be worse if he has to come get me.</p><p>He squatted there a moment more, then stood and said, I’ll see you guys, and climbed the side of the ditch and onto the street. They could see his father standing beside the dump truck, waiting on Eykelboom, who trudged along like a boy condemned, arms at his sides, big flattop head hanging down. His father didn’t even glance at the boys peeking up over the edge of the ditch as he slowly pulled his belt from its loops, folded it in half, and stood waiting, yea, like an executioner, the leather belt hanging from his big, bony right hand, his wire-rimmed spectacles gleaming in the light. When Eykelboom reached him, neither said anything. The father turned and followed Eykelboom through the carport and into the house.</p><p>The younger twin said, derisively, You guys, in an exaggerated Yankee accent. Then his brother said, in the same tone, Emile. He said, He’s beating the shit out of <em>Emile</em> right now. The three McGowen boys said nothing, their small similar mouths squinched up. [cartoon id="a18694"]</p><p>The middle brother looked at Wayne, who was staring at the Eykelbooms’ house with his eyes half-closed and his mouth slightly open, as if he were daydreaming or lobotomized or asleep on his feet. Then just his eyes moved and he was looking back at the middle brother, who felt electrified by his stare and struggled to look away.</p><p>It was a while before they saw Eykelboom again.</p><p>They almost forgot about him. They forgot to hate him.</p><p>Then one day he stepped out from behind a large shrub that grew wild in the middle of the vacant lot and followed them into the woods without their knowing it. One of their forts was a four-story tree house built with lumber stolen from an outbuilding below Mr. Chandler’s house. It was an old servants’ quarters that had been overtaken by kudzu and brush and it was far enough away from the main house and dilapidated enough that the boys had been able, like insects or spirits, to dismantle it from beneath the kudzu’s cover. They worked at it furtively, slipping pieces of the little house into the throat of the woods without once alerting Mr. Chandler.</p><p>They’d built the tree house on a hill, the first floor six feet above the ground, using three large straight pines as its foundation beams. The trees formed a rough triangle and the boys had nailed the floor joists into the trees, laid the floorboards across these, built the walls without openings except for a narrow strip between the wall and the next floor, and then nailed on more boards to form a flat roof, which served as the floor of the next story, until they had four levels. They’d stolen the remains of a roll of tarpaper from a construction site and laid sheets of this over the roof of the top room. The only entrance was a small hole in the floor next to one of the trees, which they climbed using pieces of two-by-four nailed into the trunk as a stepladder. There was also a hole in the ceiling of the top room, so that they could stick their heads out and watch for the approach of Mr. Chandler or one of their parents. Once, the twins’ mother had drunk too much gin and wandered into the woods and been lost until the boys found her, standing in a small clearing in her nightgown, barefoot and weeping.</p><p>On this day, one of the twins was on the roof for only a minute or so before coming back down.</p><p>He said, Eykelboom’s down there.</p><p>The boys were incensed that Eykelboom had followed them to this fort. It was their newest and grandest fort and they had not shown it to him when they had given their tour. Wayne climbed up through the lookout hole and then climbed back down. He looked at the oldest McGowen brother, who turned to the middle brother and said, Go down there and tell him to go away.</p><p>What if he asks to come up? the middle brother said.</p><p>He can’t come up, Wayne said. He’s not allowed.</p><p>Make him leave, the oldest brother said. Go on.</p><p>The youngest McGowen brother watched them from a dark corner, his eyes bright with excitement.</p><p>The middle brother slowly made his way down the ladder steps, floor by floor, and stuck his head out of the entrance hole when<span data-page="page_5"></span> he reached the lowest level. There stood Eykelboom, gazing into the woods with a stoic, if forlorn, expression. The middle brother figured he had heard their discussion. Eykelboom fixed a strangely calm expression on him, and said nothing.</p><p>Ikey, the middle brother said. You have to go away.</p><p>That’s right, Emile, one of the twins said from inside the fort.</p><p>Eykelboom looked suddenly angry.</p><p>I’m not going away, he said.</p><p>I can’t let you in, the middle brother said.</p><p>You don’t have the right, Eykelboom said. I can stand here all day if I want to and you can’t do anything about it.</p><p>The middle brother pulled his head back through the entrance hole and looked at the other boys, who had climbed down to the first level to listen.</p><p>It’s a free country, Eykelboom said then, louder. Which was such a Yankee thing to say.</p><p>Fred-e-rick, Wayne said in a mock-tired way, drawing out the middle brother’s given name, a name that everyone knew he did not like. Climb down there and make him go away.</p><p>The middle brother whispered back, How?</p><p>Wayne’s eyelids fluttered. He was smoothing the paper on a cigarette he’d lifted from his old man’s pack. The boys had been planning to smoke it. Wayne put the cigarette into the corner of his mouth and spoke.</p><p>Beat. His. Ass.</p><p>The middle brother did not want to go down there and beat Eykelboom’s ass. Eykelboom was big, and like his brothers the middle McGowen was small. But he couldn’t not do it. He would become lower than Eykelboom. With a swelling of sadness and doom in his heart, he descended the two-by-four ladder to the ground.</p><p>Eykelboom had crossed his arms like a stubborn, determined person on a television show, like in a musical movie or something. He was even taller and broader than the middle McGowen brother had realized. He reached out and gave Eykelboom a push, to no real effect, and Eykelboom looked away, reddening. The middle brother pushed him again, harder, and Eykelboom let out a high-pitched wail of rage. He flailed at the middle brother with his long heavy arms, landed one big blow against the middle brother’s head, and turned to leave.</p><p>The middle brother reeled and his head rang with the blow but then he heard something and saw Wayne peering at him through the entrance hole. Wayne said, Are you going to let him just do that to you?</p><p>The middle brother caught up with Eykelboom and leaped onto his back as if he were riding piggyback. Eykelboom twirled like an off-kilter top but the middle brother hung on, afraid to let go. They spun toward one of the fort’s foundation trees and slammed up against it. The middle brother fell off without a word and Eykelboom ran away toward his house, keening in his outrage and grief. Possibly it was outraged grief. The middle McGowen brother lay on the ground, stunned. Wayne stuck his head through the entrance hole and looked down at him for a moment.</p><p>Way to go, he said. Come on up.</p><p>The middle brother roused himself slowly and climbed back into the fort. The boys lit and smoked Wayne’s cigarette, passing it around. The middle brother took a puff and passed it on.</p><p>You did good, his older brother said to him.</p><p>But he didn’t feel good about any of it. He was using every bit of will he had not to cry, which would have made it all even worse.</p><p>Eykelboom disappeared. He wintered in his brooding or became as spectral as a ghost, there but not there in any evidence. Then summer came again and he drifted or sifted back into visibility, though he kept himself peripheral and quiet. He didn’t try to merge. He didn’t speak much or look at anyone directly. He’d changed, still angry but also disaffected, detached. The boys saw him do things on his own. Leave his house and go into the ditch without apparent concern, then disappear out of it into some other place, down to the lake, or into the woods, emerging hours later seeming unchanged. Sometimes his old man would be waiting for him, sometimes not. It didn’t seem to matter. He affected or displayed a studied nonchalance, leaving his father to look weak somehow as he stood waiting in the driveway holding his belt, or just balling up his rawboned workingman’s hands as if they contained all his rage, his face showing nothing.</p><p>Once Eykelboom stayed out in the woods all night at one of the boys’ forts, the oldest one, now abandoned deep in the woods. The boys found the evidence days later. Ashes and burned logs in the pit from a fire they hadn’t made. A ball of blackened foil in the ashes that had helped cook something they hadn’t eaten. What looked like Eykelboom’s big sneakers’ prints in the soft dirt around the pit. How he had got away with that, they had no idea. Then they realized that he probably hadn’t but didn’t care.</p><p>Things began to happen. The long-abandoned shack on the lake’s far bank burned down. It had once been a caretaker’s cabin. The boys had planned to steal its lumber for a new fort. The police, in the paper, called it arson. A girl’s stolen bike was found down in the bamboo, looking as if<span data-page="page_6"></span> someone had smashed its frame with a sledgehammer. A row of new saplings in the Porters’ immaculate yard was destroyed, every trunk snapped. The twins’ dog Bummer, a giant golden retriever so ancient that he never left the carport anymore, vanished one night, his body never found. The boys knew it was Eykelboom. Wayne went up to him and said so.</p><p>He said, We know it’s you doing all this crazy shit.</p><p>So what if it is? Eykelboom said.</p><p>So you’ll pay for it, Wayne said.</p><p>Says who? [cartoon id="a18548"]</p><p>If you killed Bummer, the older twin said, you deserve to die.</p><p>Eykelboom stood there with his chest poked out, like his old man, staring back at Wayne.</p><p>Says me, Wayne said. Says we.</p><p>You can’t hurt me, Eykelboom said. You can’t prove I did anything. And you don’t hate me any more than I hate you. So fuck you.</p><p>None of the boys had ever actually had those particular words said directly to them before, nor had they quite used them yet. Wayne stood chest to chest with Eykelboom. Then Wayne gave him that half smile and walked away. Eykelboom didn’t move. He looked around at the other boys. They looked back for a moment and then went home. Before going into the house with his brothers, the middle McGowen brother glanced back. Eykelboom was still there in the fading light in the vacant lot across the street from his house, looking at nothing.</p><p>He didn’t exactly disappear again. He slipped in among them now and then, silent or all but so, like a strange intelligent dog, a stray. He slipped in when they were out in the twilight, one minute not there and the next minute beside them. It was spooky. One night, in just such a moment of quiet apparition, they heard Mr. Chandler’s horse down in the woods. It sounded as if it were being attacked. The shrieking sound it made prickled their skins. Mr. Chandler often let the horse run loose in the woods, but never so far as they knew at night. More than one of them had been almost trampled while walking along a narrow trail, hearing the hooves very suddenly near, diving aside as the horse came galloping by in a heavy, heaving, wheezy blur. He was a big bay stallion. When he got out of the barn he needed a run, and there wasn’t a lot of open ground in the woods. The meadows tended to be small, no more than thirty or forty yards across. So this horse was a woods horse and he ran the trails. And maybe, they figured, that desire to run the trails was also a product of fear, because the older boys always said they’d seen bobcats in there. A couple of them even said they’d seen a panther, or had heard it scream. The boys themselves had neither heard nor seen sign of a bigger cat, but a panther was not out of the question. In this place, in this time, in this small town bordered all around by woods and rural land, any animal wanting to broaden its territory needed only to cross a few two-lane, tree-loomed roads into this or another swath of undisturbed forest. There were deer in Chandler’s woods, so why not panthers, too? When Mr. Chandler’s stallion ran in the woods, he ran like a horse with his tail on fire, or a horse with a big cat swiping at his flank, a horse who never knew from which tree something might leap onto his back and sink fangs into the spine ridging his long, exposed neck. In short, whenever he got his exercise, this horse was effectively mad with terror. You didn’t want to get in his way.</p><p>They heard the horse call out again. At first they stood very still and listened, and then Wayne said they had to go see. He came back from his house with a pair of flashlights, and Eykelboom followed them all in. They made their way across the vacant lot, through the fence, down the trail toward the swamp, the horse’s trembly bellowing growing louder. Soon they saw lantern light glowing down in the swamp, and heard the voices of men in between the sounds of the horse. They left the trail and entered the swamp, picked their way across muddy grass islands toward the yellow glow. The air was chilled, and stank like rotten roots and sewage.</p><p>Kerosene lanterns hung from swamp tree branches, illuminating the horse, up to his withers in one of the black mud sinkholes. Two men who lived in old cottages behind Mr. Chandler’s house were trying to get the horse out by levering him with thick pine boards stuck deep in the muck on either side of him. Mr. Chandler, his boots and pants heavy with mud, a battered town Stetson jammed down on his head, held a rope that was clipped to the stallion’s halter. The men helping were mud-caked head to toe, as if they’d emerged from the swamp itself to free the beast from their own sightless world. The boys stood in a bunch just outside the dissolving rim of the lanterns’ light, perched on soft hummocks of unstable swamp grass and moss, constantly shifting their feet to knobs of firmer ground.</p><p>The boards and the men and the lanterns and Mr.<span data-page="page_7"></span> Chandler’s harsh commands made the horse more afraid, and he bucked helplessly in the sinkhole. He strained and trembled, struggling to pull his forelegs free, pushing with his powerful hind legs. Every now and then he raised his head and his neck went rigid and his eyes rolled around in fear and that awful sound they’d heard from the street came from his throat, through his long clenched teeth.</p><p>The middle McGowen brother heard Eykelboom just behind him. Eykelboom said quietly, If it was my horse I’d go ahead and cut its throat.</p><p>The middle brother looked over his shoulder and saw Eykelboom staring at the horse, as they all had been, but he didn’t seem disturbed. Eykelboom pulled a Boy Scout knife from his pocket, opened the blade and felt the edge with his thumb, then folded it and put it away. The middle brother almost said, Are you in the <em>Scouts</em>?, but didn’t.</p><p>The men and the horse worked so hard their bodies shuddered with fatigue. Finally the horse was able to free his forelegs and in a series of scrambling lunges he was out. He shook his big head and yanked the halter rope from Mr. Chandler’s hands, knocking the old man into a sinkhole. He splashed straight for the boys, leaping from little island to island, busted past them with a blast from his nostrils, jumped the creek, and galloped away in the dark toward higher ground.</p><p>Help me out of this goddam hole, they heard Mr. Chandler say to the men. One of them leaned down to give him a hand, then took a lantern down from a tree branch. Mr. Chandler reached up for the other lantern and when he swung it around he saw the boys standing there like silent swamp elves.</p><p>You boys get the hell out of here, he said. You stay the <em>hell</em> out of my woods.</p><p>As they were leaving, they heard him ask one of the men to repair the fence around the swamp the next day. He said something about those little heathens having cut it. The middle McGowen brother wondered if this was true. If it had been Eykelboom. Or Wayne. He thought it was the kind of thing that either one of them might do. Wayne just to do it. Eykelboom with some inscrutable sense of purpose. Even a boy could tell that it was Eykelboom against the whole world.</p><p>Using Wayne’s flashlights, they made their way back down the dark trails and crossed the fence out of Mr. Chandler’s property. When Wayne said to Eykelboom, You know he’s going to be waiting when we come out, they all stopped. Eykelboom stood there for a minute. Fuck him, he said, I’ll just stay here. He turned and walked back into the woods.</p><p>When the boys reached the vacant lot, they could see Eykelboom’s old man standing alone in his front yard, lit by the street lamp two houses down. He held something in his hand that wasn’t a belt—a stick of some kind, thin like a thrashing cane. The boys stopped and looked back toward the dark woods. They glimpsed the faint contrast of Eykelboom’s white T-shirt farther down the trail.</p><p>Eykelboom’s father spotted them and called out, Where’s Emile?</p><p>When he began to move toward them, they took off running. [cartoon id="a18544"]</p><p>They leaped over the fence back into the woods. When the younger twin caught his foot on the barbed wire and fell, hollering, they stopped to see if he was O.K. But Eykelboom’s father was still coming toward them through the vacant lot, the stick in his hand, and they took off running again down the dark trail. They listened for Eykelboom ahead of them as they ran. Instead they heard his father, following. They ran in the dark on the trail that followed the creek to the crossing upstream. They tripped over vines and roots and stumbled in ruts but kept going. They scrambled down the upper creek bank, jumped the creek, and ran up the other side. They heard Eykelboom’s father far back on the trail—he had no flashlight and didn’t know these woods—calling out to his boy. The boys called out then, too—Eykelboom! Emile! Ikey! they called in turn.</p><p>They searched for an hour or so, then made their way back to the street. They left the woods at a different spot, crossed the fence behind the Porters’ yard, and peered out from the side of their house. A police cruiser was parked half on the street, half in the Eykelbooms’ yard. Eykelboom’s father was talking to a cop near the open door of the cruiser. His mother was there, just outside the carport, in a house robe. A couple of people stepped out of their homes, curious.</p><p>Cautiously, the boys went over. Eykelboom’s father stiffened when he saw them. He still had the stick in his hand. He looked at the cop, then at the boys.</p><p>He said, What have you little bastards done with my boy? What have you done? I’ll fucking kill you if you’ve hurt him.</p><p>It was hard not to run.</p><p>Then Wayne said, We didn’t do anything to him. What’re you doing with that stick in your hand? What were you going to do to him before he ran away?</p><p>What do you mean ran away? Eykelboom’s father said. The cop peered<span data-page="page_8"></span> at the boys from beneath his visor.</p><p>That’s right, Wayne said. He beats Ikey all the time. He made him run off.</p><p>The cop’s narrowed eyes moved from Wayne to the other boys to Eykelboom’s father. He looked at the stick.</p><p>I’ll handle this, Mr. Eykelboom, the cop said. Please put the stick down and go inside your house for now.</p><p>Eykelboom’s father didn’t move, just stood there, staring at Wayne. The boys tensed, thinking he might rush them.</p><p>Mr. Eykelboom, the cop said again.</p><p>Eykelboom’s father slowly turned his head to look at the cop, then at the stick in his hand. He gripped the stick even harder and went inside, walking past his wife without seeming to see that she was standing there in her robe and slippers, pale and speechless, her face drawn up as if there were no teeth in her head.</p><p>The cop asked the boys questions. Had they seen Eykelboom in the woods? Did they know where he might be? He got on the radio, talking.</p><p>There’s a swamp in there, Wayne said, and told him about the horse and Mr. Chandler and his men. The cop studied him for a long moment. Then he got on the radio again. He said something into the mic about Mr. Chandler. In a little while an old pickup truck grumbled down the street and parked next to the cop’s cruiser and Mr. Chandler got out, wearing clean clothes. He talked to the cop, glanced at the boys, shook his head. The cop said something else and Chandler shrugged. The cop got on the radio again. Chandler lit a half-smoked cigar he’d pulled from his shirt pocket, leaning against his truck, gazing into the shadows of his woods.</p><p>Eventually, two sheriff’s deputies dressed in hunters’ overalls went into the woods with high-beam flashlights. Soon another cop pulled up with a dog in his car and they went in, too. Neighbors came out and gathered near the cruisers, whose lights were whirling and lighting up the houses and windows and trees in the yards. People shared coffee and beer, smoking, speaking in quiet voices. Occasionally someone said something that made others laugh and then stop themselves. Mrs. Eykelboom had followed her husband inside. After a while the neighbors went home. Chandler got into his truck and left. The boys were called home by their parents. The two younger McGowen brothers watched from the dark window of the bedroom they shared, in their house next door to the Eykelbooms’. They saw the deputies make their way out of the woods, looking beat. The cop with the dog came out. The police talked among themselves. Their radios squawked. They turned off their cruisers’ flashing roof lights. Then an unmarked black car arrived. Two men in suits got out and went up to the carport. They talked to Eykelboom’s father at the door. It looked like Eykelboom’s old man wouldn’t let them in. Then he closed the door and the cops all left.</p><p>For days the police and deputies searched the woods with a pack of hunting dogs. A helicopter from the National Guard base flew over low and slow, a couple of military men in the bay looking down, searching. Drown teams pushed heavy rakes through the muck pools in the swamp. They dragged the pools near the end of the creek, then the lake below the turnaround. Police checked the bus and train stations, though the boys had never known Eykelboom to have money that he could have used for travel. Outlying farmers were queried, their barns searched. The local TV anchorman seemed to hint that something had been wrong among the Eykelbooms. But no one ever reported, <em>It is said that Eykelboom</em>’<em>s old man regularly beat the holy shit out of him</em>.</p><p>Among themselves, the boys knew that was why, idiots. Weeks passed like time under water. Winter came and went, then spring. The Eykelbooms, Mr. and Mrs., moved away. Their house sold within a month. This time it was bought by an old man who had worked at the creosote plant. Newly retired, the boys’ parents said. Occasionally the retired man’s grandson came to see him and spend the day. He was a shy boy, but nice enough, with a small face and downy blond hair. But his grandfather wouldn’t let him play with the boys. When they approached, the grandfather came out and gave them a dark glare and called his grandson back in the house.</p><p>Wayne went off. He didn’t move away, or disappear like Eykelboom, but he stopped hanging out with the boys. They rarely saw him. The oldest McGowen brother had become interested in other things, as well, and pretended the younger two did not exist.</p><p>The boys effectively disbanded, a tacit dissolution. They abandoned their forts. It was said that Chandler now kept wild dogs in the woods and fed them deer he shot from his back porch and dragged to a clearing below his house. Then, one late summer night, the woods burned, flames leaping up to the low evening clouds and turning them red and orange. Forest crews managed to contain the fire, but the woods were destroyed, their ruins like a blasted, ghosted battlefield, stumps and blackened fallen trunks releasing swirls of smoke into winter. Spring seedlings worked their way from the dirt, but before they could begin<span data-page="page_final"></span> to grow a man in a backhoe churned through the mud and dug a long trench from the lake to the swamp, draining it. Another crew laid a large concrete pipe and installed storm drains on what looked like concrete chimneys emerging from the pipe. Then they covered the pipe with dirt. A grader smoothed and levelled the land. The developer had been waiting, knowing that Chandler would sell. During all this, a policeman kept watch, in case there were human remains. There were no remains. No one would ever know what became of Eykelboom. If he was alive somewhere, the boys felt sure that no one knew who he really was. They believed he had made some kind of miraculous escape. Into some other life that he had made up and now occupied, somewhere else. He had passed himself off as older, used his outsized body to get a job in construction, a factory, an oil field. He rarely spoke to anyone, no more than was absolutely necessary. He was a mystery to everyone who knew him now, wherever he might be.</p><p>They all grew older, in the visible world, scattered carelessly into this life or that. The boys’ parents sifted into their private, forgotten histories, crumbs of memory in a landscape of stained tablecloths and kitchen floors.</p><p>The two younger McGowen brothers, having survived their older brother as well as their parents, had become drinkers, and sometimes when they were together, drinking and talking, the middle brother would mention Eykelboom. Together, over time, they dismissed the old theory of escape and began to envision Eykelboom deep down in what used to be the swamp. They imagined that the sinkholes there were deeper than anyone had ever known. In spite of the elaborate drainage system the developer installed, the area where the swamp had been was never developed. It had never stabilized.</p><p>The brothers imagined Eykelboom there, preserved and whole, curled up in a cold, fluid clay, drifting very slowly with the earth itself. His fists lay knotted against his cheeks, his knees to his chest, his face closed tight in an infinite, chilled gestation. ♦</p>	Brad Watson	November 24, 2014 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/24/eykelboom	Boys	Childhood	Children	Fathers	Horses	Neighborhoods	Eykelboom	Third	Children
Fable	<p>Once upon a time, there was a man whose therapist thought it would be a good idea for the man to work through some stuff by telling a story about that stuff.</p><p>The man lived in a one-bedroom efficiency cottage all by himself, in a sort of dicey part of town. One day, the man woke up and realized that this was pretty much it for him. It wasn’t terrible. But it wasn’t great, either. And not likely to improve. The man was smart enough to realize this, yet not quite smart enough to do anything about it. He lived out the rest of his days and eventually died. The end. Happy now?</p><p>The man could see that his therapist was not amused.</p><p>A rather unsatisfactory ending, the therapist opined, and suggested that the man could do better. The man thought, Is she really serious about this? But he didn’t say anything out loud. The man was not convinced that he needed to be talking to the therapist at all, but he had tried so many other things (potions, spells, witches), and spent so much of his copper and silver, with absolutely nothing to show for it, that he figured why the hell not.</p><p>So how do I do this? he asked.</p><p>Why don’t you start again? the therapist replied. And, instead of rushing to the end, try to focus on the details.</p><p>O.K., the man said.</p><p>Once upon a time, there was a man who did not know how to use a sword and was also very afraid of dragons, so he took the L.S.A.T., did pretty well, and ended up getting into a decent law school. There he learned useful skills. Skills that would allow him to earn a living in the village and to court the women of that village.</p><p>But what the man came to find soon after graduation was that, in this particular village, there were many people with the same skills. Many, many people. Really hard to overstate how many lawyers there were in that village. Accordingly, despite the man’s efforts the local maidens were not overly impressed. And, after all that schooling, the man was ashamed to admit the sad fact that he still did not know how to use a sword.</p><p>But the man was fine with this. Totally cool with it. Did not feel inadequate whatsoever. He landed a job with a medium-sized firm. The pay was a bit below market, and the position wasn’t exactly his first choice. Top three, maybe. Top fiveish. Somewhere in there. Nevertheless, again, the man could have done worse. Competently plying his trade afforded him a very livable existence. Allowed him to enjoy the company of loved ones. His parents were both gone now, and his sister lived in another kingdom, on the other side of the sea. But it wasn’t like he didn’t have friends. He totally had friends. People he could call to get the occasional beer or catch a movie. It was just that, well, there were those nights. Nights when the moon was new and the sky was dark, and the hour before dawn stretched out before him, threatening never to end. On those endless nights, he would lie in his cottage alone, looking through the window, up at the starless sky, and wondering: Was there a life for him out there in the world? Someone who would love him? Or could learn to love him or, at least, let herself be loved by him?</p><p>He thought about enchanting some young lady, but he had no talent for magic so that was not really an option. If he was going to find a fair maiden to marry him, he would have to do it the old-fashioned way: trick her into it. Kidding. No, he was going to have to find a woman with sufficiently low standards so as to give himself a fighting chance.</p><p>He eventually found such a woman, the only daughter of the candlemaker, a girl whom everyone thought of as plain. Also sad. Quite sad. Not until they had been married for many years would the man come to understand how sad she truly was.</p><p>But the man was getting ahead of himself. For now, the point was the man knew that he had to marry the candlemaker’s daughter. Because unlike everyone else in the village, including the candlemaker himself, the man could see one thing: the young lady was not plain at all. She simply possessed a very mild form of magic, which she used for the purpose of hiding her loveliness. The man told the girl that he knew her secret. She denied it, and he told her that he knew she would deny it. Of course she had to deny that she was, in actuality, the most fetching maiden in the village—maybe in the entire realm. The girl looked confused. Her face flushed with embarrassment. She searched his eyes, trying to understand. Was the man teasing her? But the man did not smile. He seemed earnest. Told her that he knew why she used her magic to hide her beauty: it was in order to protect herself. But, for some reason, he (and only he) could see through it. Now the girl started to cry, because surely the man was trying to humiliate<span data-page="page_2"></span> her, wasn’t he? But she saw that he remained earnest. And, after a while, she stopped crying and, her face slick with tears, kissed the man softly on the lips.</p><p>The man asked the candlemaker for his daughter’s hand in marriage. Her father asked that the man slay a dragon to prove his devotion. Even though the man was in decent shape, totally respectable shape, especially considering that he didn’t have time to go to the gym, he still wasn’t strong enough to swing a two-handed broadsword. So, being nothing if not practical, he sought out the smallest dragon he could find.</p><p>After a long search, he found one not much bigger than a wild fowl. Possibly a baby. If we’re being honest, the dragon looked sickly. It had scared, wet eyes, and as the man raised his sword above his head to slay it his betrothed said to him, Don’t. Please. That’s dumb. You don’t need to kill a baby dragon just to prove something to me. All right, the man said, barely hiding his relief. He lowered his sword, petted the young dragon on the head, and sent it back to the cave or wherever. The candlemaker was angry, or maybe not angry—he was a fairly gentle soul—but definitely miffed. Still, he wanted his daughter married off, so, grudgingly, he gave his blessing. The man had found his wife.</p><p>He said to her, I will provide you with a good life. Pretty good, at least. She said, Quit talking and let’s go before my father changes his mind.</p><p>And so they did.</p><p>And the man loved his wife. To the extent that he knew how to love, anyway. The man had a clumsiness about him, in his hands and in his heart. He fumbled words, missed chances, and, despite his best intentions, was prone to mishandling fragile things. Together they shared a quiet existence that was defined by well-managed expectations. Perhaps not the stuff of legends. Not quite deserving of “once upon a time.” But it was comfortable and honest.</p><p>He wondered aloud, ahem, if this was really worth his and the therapist’s time.</p><p>But the man was coming to understand that his therapist was not going to let him out of this exercise until he had navigated his way along</p><p>(1) an emotionally honest path to</p><p>(2) an unexpected</p><p>(3) yet inevitable destination.</p><p>Whatever that meant.</p><p>The man sighed loudly and continued.</p><p>Once upon a time, there was a guy who couldn’t swing a sword and nearly peed his pants whenever he saw even a toddler-size dragon, so he went to law school, where he learned a bunch of very useful skills, and when he graduated he became a lawyer, and he was pretty O.K. at that, and it allowed him to build a life, try to build a life.</p><p>Great. The therapist liked where this was going.</p><p>But he had dreams of more. He told his wife this, as they lay in their cold stone hut at night.</p><p>Oh? she said, hopeful. A little surprised. What do you dream of? Being a hero?</p><p>No, he said sheepishly. Deep down in his heart, what he dreamed of was not to be a lawyer, or a hero, but a blacksmith. A silly dream, he knew, so he had never told anyone. He waited for her to laugh, but she didn’t. She said that it was a lovely thing to dream of.</p><p>But, having said this, the man was already talking himself out of it. Blacksmithing was old-fashioned and hardly anyone actually made a living at it anymore. He would, of course, keep his job as a lawyer. Would always provide for her. And the candlemaker’s daughter said, I know you will.</p><p>It was cold, so they spooned. Made love under the nearly empty night sky. Through the window, the man saw a single star. It hung low, twinkling at them.</p><p>This was kind of how they did things for a while. Talked at night, made love, and then the man would fall asleep and his wife would listen to him snore and worry about him. He seemed tired, overworked. She would worry well past the witching hour, and at some point drift off into her own restless half-sleep, just before dawn. She had anxiety and took potions for it, and herbs, and other things from the apothecary. All of it was prescription—it wasn’t like she was self-medicating or anything. But the potions didn’t help, or maybe helped a little—they caused her to have spells of forgetfulness, to lose an hour here or there, but nothing really could lessen her dread. It turned out that she was right to feel dread.</p><p>One night, in the very short time during which both she and her husband were asleep, a sorceress from far away, whom they didn’t know, put a spell on their home, for some reason they would never understand. They would not ever be blessed with the gift of a child. That one star hung in the sky, and it would never fall to Earth for them.</p><p>The couple handled this news in different ways. The candlemaker’s daughter did research, read books about it. Found a local support group that met on Tuesdays. The man, unsure of what to say, tried not to talk about it. Stopped blacksmithing for a while. Started grinding his<span data-page="page_3"></span> teeth at night. A distance grew between them. The man wanted to touch his wife, to be with her, but it hurt too much.</p><p>Still, they loved each other. After work one day, the man came home with two bottles of good wine and they opened both bottles and sat on the floor in the middle of the living room in their hut and drank all the wine and ate an entire loaf of hard bread and laughed at each other and at themselves, tried to see the silver lining in being cursed by a malevolent force, and, in the morning when they woke up, they felt a little better.</p><p>They made a list. There was always adoption. Which took time and money and patience and luck. But they were in no rush, were they? Plus, while they waited they could enjoy each other. Take more vacations. If they could save up enough copper coins, maybe even go all the way to the seashore. Eventually. Why not? They were staying glass half full about it all.</p><p>And then, out of nowhere, boom. Just like that. Just when the man had given up, you know? One day the star did fall from the sky into the belly of the man’s wife. And there it burned for six weeks until it had a heartbeat. At twelve weeks, they told family, friends. At eighteen weeks, they found out: it would be a boy. Their boy. And the lawyer-blacksmith and the candlemaker’s daughter were overjoyed. They didn’t want to question why it had happened now, or whether it had anything to do with them finally letting go. They just thanked the heavens and the earth and whatever little magic might be left in the world.</p><p>It wasn’t the easiest pregnancy. There were nights when the invisible wolf, carried along by the fire wind, would come and snatch at the child with its jaws, try to take it away and carry it back into the hills. The wolf came at thirty weeks. At thirty-two weeks, it came again, and the sage elder mages were worried and had the man’s wife spend the night, just for observation. Just a precaution.</p><p>Fortune was smiling, though, and they made it to thirty-five weeks. The mages still had concerns. They looked into their crystal balls or whatever. Behind closed doors, they talked in hushed tones. They nodded their sage heads sagely, stroked their beards, gave the lawyer-blacksmith grim and ponderous looks. Ugh, the mages were really kind of awful about the whole thing. So when the child was finally born the man and his wife wept with joy and relief. Two arms and two legs. Two eyes, a nose and a mouth, color in his cheeks. Head covered with wisps of soft, almost invisible hair.</p><p>It was a few weeks later that the man’s wife first noticed it.</p><p>Something about their baby.</p><p>Difficult to see at first, because the boy looked fine. He acted fine. Nursed. Slept.</p><p>For the first two months, the blacksmith and his wife would frequently stop what they were doing, pause, and look at each other. As if to say, We did it.</p><p>Six months in, they didn’t look at each other anymore; instead, each of them silently studied their boy. Afraid to say anything to the other, lest they make it real by uttering out into the world what was, day by day, increasingly hard to ignore. Saying only generally positive things, vague expressions of hope. No reason to worry yet. Don’t jump to any conclusions.</p><p>At twelve months, they said nothing. There was no need to say anything.</p><p>The man and his wife took the boy back to the mage who had brought him into the world. At first, the old wizard refused to see them. He shook his head gently. The man’s wife begged. Fell to her knees and pleaded. The lawyer-blacksmith tried to pull her up by the arms. But she wouldn’t move. She cried there in front of the mage’s tower for three brutally hot days and three painfully cold nights, the man watching over her the whole time.</p><p>On the morning of the fourth day, the mage emerged, on his way to somewhere else, and was alarmed and scared as he stumbled over the candlemaker’s daughter, still waiting there. He could not let this go on any longer.</p><p>Your son, he said. He will never be of this world.</p><p>Now the man’s wife broke down with fresh tears. The man stared at the mage and said, What do you mean? What does that mean? I know you’re a mage and that’s how you talk, but you can’t say something like that and then just stand there.</p><p>The boy’s spirit, the mage explained, what some might call his soul—it is trapped. You can think of it as being inside a small box, and that box is inside another box, and that box in another, and so on.</p><p>Is this because of the curse?</p><p>Could be. Hard to say. It is possible that the child is afraid to come into the world, or that he is not fully allowed to, owing to the persistent dark energy that was attached to his creation.</p><p>Dark energy. At this phrase, the man’s skin turned cold. He feared. He knew. Something in him had caused all of this. He had no<span data-page="page_4"></span> way of proving it, but the man knew it was his fault, could not even look at his wife, afraid that just one look and she would instantly understand.</p><p>But if his wife did have any such thoughts she did not betray them. She took the man’s hand in hers and pressed the mage for options. What could they do? Tell us what to do.</p><p>The answer, the mage said, may be hidden deep within him. Too deep to retrieve safely. You will never know him. But you will care for him, love him, see that he has everything a child needs.</p><p>As soon as the lawyer-blacksmith heard these words, he knew that they were true. He wondered what insurance would cover; he worried about the large deductible, the high cap on out-of-pocket expenses. Ahead of him, the lawyer-blacksmith saw many years of therapists, of special schools, of helpers. No birthday parties. No playdates or friends. No playing baseball with his son.</p><p>At sixteen months, the boy stood up once, clapped his hands.</p><p>At twenty months, a word: Bye. Bye-bye. Bye.</p><p>Then, at two years, more words, all in rapid succession: Mama, baby, Da, sorry.</p><p>Why sorry?</p><p>Maybe he heard it often.</p><p>At three, he said, What’s that? And, Who’s that? And, Where are we going?</p><p>When he was five, the lawyer-blacksmith’s son said, Dad is my best friend. He said this from very far away, from a place deep inside himself. The man could barely hear his son. The boy was sitting on the ground and looked confused, and from his mouth came a terrible sound. An old sound, a pain trapped in there. The boy looked out the window at other boys running. He wanted to run. But his legs wouldn’t work right.</p><p>His father said, They do work, son. Your legs are just fine.</p><p>And the son said, Then why do I feel stuck?</p><p>His father said, We will get you unstuck. Those are nice legs, good legs. Don’t be mad at your legs. Look at me. Look at Mommy. We will figure this out. We gave you those legs. We are sorry. I am sorry. But it is not your fault. And you will get to run.</p><p>The boy eventually did run. Sort of. It looked funny, and other boys laughed at him. So after a few tries the boy stopped running.</p><p>Was the man O.K.? Did he need a moment?</p><p>The man was fine.</p><p>A glass of water, perhaps?</p><p>No, the man said. I’m fine.</p><p>Deep breath, O.K.?</p><p>In other ways, things were going pretty well. As it turned out, the man did have a talent for blacksmithing. Not a great talent. He would not make swords for knights and princes. But he had something. And people noticed. They started to bring him stuff to smith, and he could smith the heck out of that stuff. He hammered stuff and flattened other stuff and made stuff, stuck stuff in the fire, and stuff. What had started out as a thing on the side turned into a little bit of a cottage industry.</p><p>He had time to do this because he had quit his job at the firm and now worked as a lawyer in local government. No bonus, but good benefits. And the hours were so much better. Now the man was home most nights for dinner. He and his wife and son moved to a slightly bigger cottage, just outside the village. The lawyer-blacksmith was still no knight or lord, of course, but he could provide for his family. They were never hungry. Things were fine, mostly, although sometimes when they went down to the village for a harvest festival, other families would look at them, and they hated the way they were looked at. Sympathy, mixed with something else. Something like, I admire you, but don’t touch me or I might catch your plague of misfortune. Sympathy, as in, I sympathize, my heart goes outward to you— outward to you, as in, You over there, stay over there, don’t come any closer. I will admire you from a distance. The man knew that look well. The man’s wife said, Don’t be so hard on people. They mean well. But the man said, Meaning well is for shit. Oh, he knew that look and how he hated that look. The presumptuousness of it. Those other families didn’t say anything. That was the worst part. Except when they did say something. And that was even worse: So inspiring. You must be so strong, selfless. Now, <em>that</em> was a fairy tale. The idea of selfless people. As if their lives were somehow different, as if they didn’t have flaws and urges, didn’t ever want to have a couple of drinks, or three, or ten. As if having a kid like theirs made them into some kind of charmed species, some imaginary fairy-tale type of nonhuman humans, people who never got bored or tired or horny. But the blacksmith-lawyer, as much as he resented these strangers with their heartfelt looks, couldn’t blame them. So he ignored them.</p><p>He was up for a promotion to managing attorney of his department. By now his son was eight. No, closer to ten. Now fifteen. The years were getting away from him. The boy still had no friends, and though it hurt the man every time<span data-page="page_5"></span> his son asked why not, it hurt more on the day that his son stopped asking. That was years ago now. Things were still fine. The cottage felt small, so they bought another one. Not great timing, because a month later the blacksmith-lawyer was passed over for the better job. Something about his not having the right attitude. He’d heard back-channel whispers throughout the village that the higher-ups in the department all liked him, but they wondered if he could commit to the additional responsibility. Given, well, his circumstances. They knew he had a kid at home who required extra care. That was all maybe a nice way for them to not say what the problem really was. Maybe that they found it kind of depressing to be around him. They all felt for him, though. His lovely wife, his special-needs kid or whatever. They would never fire him, he knew. He could have a job there for as long as he wanted, doing land surveys on local fiefdoms. Dividing up the realm for lesser lords and vassals, assessing taxes on men far richer than he could ever dream of being. Drawing a steady stream of copper into his accounts. A stable life, a life for his family. That was the right thing to do.</p><p>So he did it. He was angry at his wife, even though she had never asked him to do it. He began staying out late, for work, at first, and then not for work. His wife made ever more frequent trips to the apothecary. Began to learn the trade. Soon she had perfected a potion of her own. An elixir for relaxation, she called it. Just to get through the day.</p><p>Their son continued to grow. His body did, anyway. The rest of him, it was harder to tell. At times, he seemed like a soul trapped inside a mind trapped inside a brain trapped inside a body. A body that turned into a man’s body, while somewhere in there, flitting around like a moth, without any direction or understanding, was a child. A baby. Their baby.</p><p>Fuck, man, do I have to do this? I don’t know if I can keep doing this.</p><p>Keep going. This is good.</p><p>What’s good?</p><p>The therapist said that this was serious progress. The man was finally getting somewhere.</p><p>The man didn’t know what else to say. His armpits were sweaty, his back hurt, his ass was sore from the therapist’s lumpy couch. He had to take a piss. He was tired of narrating.</p><p>O.K., then. He could have a break, drink some water, and then, whenever he was ready, start again.</p><p>The man didn’t want to start again. But the therapist cast a meaningful gaze at the clock and the man understood that his time was almost up, and so he started again. Once upon a time, there was a therapist who had no idea what she was doing.</p><p>The man waited for a reaction, but the therapist didn’t take the bait. She didn’t say anything. She nodded, and leaned forward, and waited for him to continue.</p><p>Once upon a time, there was a therapist who wasn’t going to do any good and cost too much, and it’s not like the man was made of money. He did all right, but this was not exactly in the budget, and, anyway, they weren’t the kind of people who hired therapists. That was for rich people. It was his wife’s idea, soon to be ex-wife, maybe, and what kind of crap was this, imposing conditions on him, to save his marriage, like he deserved this, after all he had done—conditions. Conditions! Like he was the only one who was broken. Like he was the only one who had maybe got a little too angry at the kid, the man-child, never violent but just a little mean. But, God damn it, he didn’t know where the meanness came from. He couldn’t help it, really, when it started rising up in him, the blood and heat, climbing into his face, and he could feel it—he was going to say something that he couldn’t take back, he was going to say something that was the opposite of what he wanted to say, when all he wanted to do was stroke the boy’s cheek and say—</p><p>Sorry. Shit. Sorry. I’m all over the place.</p><p>It’s O.K. Take a moment. Take as long as you need.</p><p>I don’t know.</p><p>What don’t you know?</p><p>I don’t know if I can do this.</p><p>Have a sip of water.</p><p>The man took a sip of ice-cold water.</p><p>Once upon a time, there was an angry guy, who hated the story he was in. All right? He was angry, O.K.? Once upon a time, there was a guy who wasn’t allowed to start a story with “once upon a time.” Because it wasn’t once upon a time. It was a specific time. And he wasn’t a blacksmith—he was just a regular guy who lived in the forest. He waited maybe too long to get married, but the thing was, he had his mom to take care of, never felt it was time, all those years, watching her body shrivel up. His mom, who deserved better. He worked days, and at night he looked after her, and then, when she was gone, he got married. A little later<span data-page="page_6"></span> in life. Maybe too late. But he’d wanted his own story. Just a simple one. That was all he and his wife wanted, and the ob-gyn told them about the elevated risks, the witch’s curse and all that. But whatever. They had the boy anyway. The man and his wife and the boy who laughed and clapped but didn’t talk or run. It was a family. His family. His wife—she was good, she was a better person than he was. She showed him how to love the boy. He loved the hell out of the boy.</p><p>And they moved even deeper into the forest. They wanted to be far from everything else. They didn’t want to see other people anymore. Wanted to find another forest, another village, another once upon a time, where they’d be safe from potions, and spells, and anything else. Dragons. Werewolves. Curses. A place without magic. Wherever that might be.</p><p>The guy and his wife built their house to be strong, fortifying it with wood, sticks, mud, stones, whatever they could find. They lived carefully, quietly, didn’t even look at each other most days. They’d had enough of living in a half-assed fairy tale. Enough bloodshed, enough potions and elixirs, enough of that for a lifetime. They figured if they didn’t talk, didn’t try to understand it all, then the story would just go away. Would stop trying to mean something, would stop trying to break their broken hearts.</p><p>So they stopped thinking. At night, they stopped dreaming. From their heads, they carved out the parts that had made dreams and fed them to wild animals. Scattered their dream-stuff on the ground, to be pecked at, gnawed at, chewed up. Waking, sleeping without dreams, working. Like this, they passed many days. Years.</p><p>The boy grew. But he didn’t, really.</p><p>Then one day the man looked at his wife across the breakfast table. She was putting a strawberry into their son’s mouth. Their son was smiling. Dumb, unknowing, a grown man’s face with the eyes of a child. The smile of an idiot.</p><p>This was the most beautiful thing the man had ever seen.</p><p>For a moment, he was happy.</p><p>He went out to gather wood and, in his happiness, walked much farther from his home than he had in a long time. He came upon a stream, over which there had once been a bridge, whose wooden planks had now rotted away. And there he discovered a curious sight.</p><p>On the other side of the ruined bridge, sitting there alone, was his son.</p><p>What are you doing out here? the man asked. How did you get here?</p><p>The boy said he didn’t know. He started to moan. A horrid sound. A grown man crying like a baby. I’m sorry, he said, I’m so sorry.</p><p>O.K., the man said. O.K. Don’t cry. Tell me, sorry for what, little dude? What are you sorry for?</p><p>For all the trouble. For messing up your life.</p><p>Oh, God, the man said. No.</p><p>The man was the one who should apologize. How could he possibly explain that he wasn’t strong enough, or good enough, to be the boy’s father?</p><p>The boy said that he was trapped, wasn’t he? Trapped over here, on this side of the bridge. He started to cry again.</p><p>From across the distance, the man tried to soothe his son. Hummed to him, a song from when he was a baby. The boy stopped sobbing for a moment, long enough to say, Dad, tell me a story.</p><p>But what kind of story could the man tell? The man wasn’t a good enough storyteller. He’d had a kind of allegorical thing going for him once, but he’d lost the trail. No map, no legend. He no longer knew what stood for what.</p><p>He looked around. He was in the darkest part of the forest. He didn’t know this area. The cottage, the clearing in the woods, it was all so small, and so far from everything. The sounds coming from the trees were frightening. The man realized now what he had done. He had tried to ignore the story. He and his wife had tried to go on with their days, not speaking or thinking too hard. But the story had never gone away. Neglect and time had done their work. While the man wasn’t looking, this place had fallen apart.</p><p>He turned to see where he had come from and saw that the trail back to the cottage led nowhere. A few yards from him, it just sort of faded into the surroundings. Behind him, no way to retrace his steps. In front of him, a bridge to his son that had long since rotted. If he tried to cross, it wouldn’t hold his weight. He couldn’t get from here to there.</p><p>So, instead, he turned away from both, away from home and from his son. And he just ran. He ran as fast as he could, flat out running through the unknown forest. And then his wife was running beside him. And every ghoul, every beast, every horrible thing, corporeal, immaterial, every thing that had ever hunted or haunted the man and the woman, was now right behind them, pressing. And leading them all was their son, their son, asking, Don’t you want to be my parents? Why not? Why not? Soon they<span data-page="page_final"></span> couldn’t remember if they’d ever done anything but run. Their lives had been one long chase.</p><p>No, the man said, this isn’t fair.</p><p>And his wife said, We have no time for fair.</p><p>And the man said, Why are we running? We’re in our own story. We don’t have to run.</p><p>Then he looked down at his body, and he saw that he was not a hero, not a blacksmith, or anything else. He looked over at his wife and saw that she was not a damsel in distress, not a candlemaker’s daughter. He barely knew her anymore. But he knew that she was Rachel. She was whoever was inside of Rachel. She was the mother of their child. Their boy. He looked at the boy. A grownup man now. Still a boy. A lovable boy trapped inside a smelly man, and he knew that he would wipe the boy’s nose and ass and anything else for as long as he needed to, because that’s what blacksmiths do. That’s what fairy-tale heroes do. They become government lawyers. They buy groceries. They shave their son three times a week, and feed him pudding, and sing to him once in a while.</p><p>This was not a dream, not a fairy tale. This was all there was, all there would be.</p><p>Once upon a time, there was a fable, and maybe at one point things corresponded, one for one, or close enough, but somewhere along the way it had twisted, and now he wasn’t sure what it was.</p><p>The man was out of ideas. He heard the clock ticking: <em>tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick</em>. He looked at his therapist, wondering if he was already overtime. The therapist didn’t say anything. The man understood that he was in a new territory. He’d reached the edge of the forest. There was nowhere left to run.</p><p>He took a breath, realized that he was still sweating. Was this what the therapist had wanted? A lawyer-blacksmith in her office, sweating all over her couch, slowly losing his grip? Did she know how to help him? Could she help him remember how to get from here to there?</p><p>Time’s up, she said. It’s a start.</p><p>A start?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>The man looked at his therapist. Wondering if she could possibly be serious.</p><p>His lunch hour was over. The man got up to leave. On his way out the door, he said, See you next week, and the therapist said, Maybe. He turned to look at her. She said, Let’s see where you go from here.</p><p>The man went down the hall, relieved himself, washed his hands, splashed water on his face. As he stepped back out into the hallway, that was when he saw it. It looked like—but come on, no way. He was just seeing things now. But. Could it be?</p><p>In the carpet, the faintest outline.</p><p>A trail.</p><p>Where did it lead? Was it a way out? Or a way in?</p><p>And the man said to himself, All right, then, maybe she’s right. If this is where your story starts, then so be it. ♦</p>	Charles Yu	May 30, 2016 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/05/30/fable-by-charles-yu	Autism	Babies	Books	Children	Fables	Happiness	Unnamed	Third	Children
Foster	<p>Early <span data-page="page_1"></span>on a Sunday, after first Mass in Clonegal, my father, instead of taking me home, drives deep into Wexford toward the coast, where my mother’s people came from. It is a hot August day, bright, with patches of shade and greenish sudden light along the road. We pass through the village of Shillelagh, where my father lost our red shorthorn in a game of forty-five, and on past the mart in Carnew, where the man who won her sold her not long afterward. My father throws his hat on the passenger seat, winds down the window, and smokes. I shake the plaits out of my hair and lie flat on the back seat, looking up through the rear window. I wonder what it will be like, this place belonging to the Kinsellas. I see a tall woman standing over me, making me drink milk still hot from the cow. I see another, less likely version of her, in an apron, pouring pancake batter into a frying pan, asking would I like another, the way my mother sometimes does when she is in good humor. The man will be her size. He will take me to town on the tractor and buy me red lemonade and crisps. Or he’ll make me clean out sheds and pick stones and pull ragweed and docks out of the fields. I wonder if they live in an old farmhouse or a new bungalow, whether they will have an outhouse or an indoor bathroom, with a toilet and running water.</p><p>An age, it seems, passes before the car slows and turns in to a tarred, narrow lane, then slams over the metal bars of a cattle grid. On either side, thick hedges are trimmed square. At the end of the lane, there’s a white house with trees whose limbs are trailing the ground.</p><p>“Da,” I say. “The trees.”</p><p>“What about them?”</p><p>“They’re sick,” I say.</p><p>“They’re weeping willows,” he says, and clears his throat.</p><p>On the housefront, tall, shiny windowpanes reflect our coming. I see myself looking out from the back seat, as wild as a tinker’s child, with my hair all undone, but my father, at the wheel, looks just like my father. A big, loose hound lets out a few rough, halfhearted barks, then sits on the step and looks back at the doorway, where the man has come out to stand. He has a square body like the men my sisters sometimes draw, but his eyebrows are white, to match his hair. He looks nothing like my mother’s people, who are all tall, with long arms, and I wonder if we have not come to the wrong house.</p><p>“Dan,” he says, and tightens himself. “What way are you?”</p><p>“John,” Da says.</p><p>They stand looking out over the yard for a moment and then they are talking rain: how little rain there is, how the priest in Kilmuckridge prayed for rain this very morning, how a summer like this was never before known. There is a pause, during which my father spits, and then the conversation turns to the price of cattle, the E.E.C., butter mountains, the cost of lime and sheep-dip. I am used to it, this way men have of not talking: they like to kick a divot out of the grass with a boot heel, to slap the roof of a car before it takes off, to sit with their legs wide apart, as though they do not care.</p><p>When the woman comes out, she pays no heed to the men. She is even taller than my mother, with the same black hair, but hers is cut tight like a helmet. She’s wearing a printed blouse and brown, flared trousers. The car door is opened and I am taken out, and kissed.</p><p>“The last time I saw you, you were in the pram,” she says, and stands back, expecting an answer.</p><p>“The pram’s broken.”</p><p>“What happened at all?”</p><p>“My brother used it for a wheelbarrow and the wheel fell off.”</p><p>She laughs and licks her thumb and wipes something off my face. I can feel her thumb, softer than my mother’s, wiping whatever it is away. When she looks at my clothes, I see my thin cotton dress, my dusty sandals through her eyes. Neither one of us knows what to say. A queer, ripe breeze is crossing the yard.</p><p>“Come on in, <em>a leanbh</em>.”</p><p>She leads me into the house. There’s a moment of darkness in the hallway; when I hesitate, she hesitates with me. We walk through into the heat of the kitchen, where I am told to sit down, to make myself at home. Under the smell of baking, there’s some disinfectant, some bleach. She lifts a rhubarb tart out of the oven and puts it on the bench. Pale-yellow roses are as still as the jar of water they are standing in.</p><p>“So how is your mammy keeping?”</p><p>“She won a tenner on the prize bonds.”</p><p>“She did not.”</p><p>“She did,” I say. “We all had jelly and ice cream and she bought a new tube for the bicycle.”</p><p>I feel, again, the steel teeth of the comb against my scalp earlier that morning, the strength of my mother’s hands as she wove my plaits tight, her belly at my back, hard with the next baby. I think of the clean pants she packed in<span data-page="page_2"></span> the suitcase, the letter, and what she must have written. Words had passed between my mother and my father:</p><p><em>“How long should they keep her</em>?<em>”</em></p><p><em>“Can’t they keep her as long as they like</em>?<em>”</em></p><p><em>“Is that what I’ll say</em>?<em>”</em></p><p><em>“Say what you like. Isn’t it what you always do.”</em></p><p>Now the woman fills an enamel jug with milk.</p><p>“Your mother must be busy.”</p><p>“She’s waiting for them to come and cut the hay.”</p><p>“Have ye not the hay cut?” she says. “Aren’t ye late?”</p><p>As the men come in from the yard, it grows momentarily dark, then brightens once again when they sit down.</p><p>“Well, Missus,” Da says, pulling out a chair.</p><p>“Dan,” she says, in a different voice.</p><p>“There’s a scorcher of a day.”</p><p>“ ’Tis hot, surely.” She turns her back to watch the kettle, waiting.</p><p>“Wasn’t it a great year for the hay all the same. Never saw the like of it,” Da says. “The loft is full to capacity. I nearly split my head on the rafters pitching it in.”</p><p>I wonder why my father lies about the hay. He is given to lying about things that would be nice, if they were true. Somewhere farther off, someone has started up a chainsaw and it drones on like a big, stinging wasp for a while. I wish I was out there, working. I am unused to sitting still and do not know what to do with my hands. Part of me wants my father to leave me here while another wants him to take me back, to what I know. I am in a spot where I can neither be what I always am nor turn into what I could be.</p><p>The kettle rumbles up to the boiling point, its steel lid clapping. Kinsella gets a stack of plates from the cupboard, opens a drawer and takes out knives and forks, teaspoons. He opens a jar of beetroot and puts it on a saucer with a little serving fork, leaves out sandwich spread and salad cream. Already there’s a bowl of tomatoes and onions, chopped fine, a fresh loaf, ham, a block of red cheddar.</p><p>“And what way is Mary?” the woman says.</p><p>“Mary? She’s coming near her time.”</p><p>“I suppose the last babby is getting hardy?”</p><p>“Aye,” Da says. “He’s crawling. It’s feeding them that’s the trouble. There’s no appetite like a child’s and, believe you me, this one is no different.”</p><p>“Ah, don’t we all eat in spurts, the same as we grow,” the woman says, as though this is something he should know.</p><p>“She’ll ate but you can work her.”</p><p>Kinsella looks up at his wife. “There’ll be no need for any of that,” he says. “The child will have no more to do than help Edna around the house.”</p><p>“We’ll keep the child gladly,” the woman echoes. “She’s welcome here.”</p><p>When we sit in at the table, Da tastes the ham and reaches for the beetroot. He doesn’t use the serving fork but pitches it onto the plate with his own. It stains the pink ham, bleeds. Tea is poured. There’s a patchy silence as we eat, our knives and forks breaking up what’s on our plates. After some little scraps of speech, the tart is cut. Cream falls over the hot pastry, into warm pools.</p><p>Now that my father has delivered me and eaten his fill, he is anxious to light his fag and get away. Always, it’s the same: he never stays in any place long after he’s eaten, not like my mother, who would talk until it grew dark and light again. This, at least, is what my father says. I have never known it to happen. With my mother it is all work: us, the butter-making, the dinners, the washing up and getting up and getting ready for Mass and school, weaning calves, and hiring men to plow and harrow the fields, stretching the money and setting the alarm for a time before the sun rises. But this is a different type of house. Here there is room to think. There may even be money to spare.</p><p>“I’d better hit the road,” Da says.</p><p>“What hurry is on you?” Kinsella says.</p><p>“The daylight is burning, and I’ve yet the spuds to spray.”</p><p>“There’s no fear of blight these evenings,” the woman says, but she gets up anyway, and goes out the back door with a sharp knife. A silence climbs between the men while she is gone.</p><p>“Give this to Mary,” she says, coming in. “I’m snowed under with rhubarb, whatever kind of year it is.”</p><p>My father takes the rhubarb from her, but it is as awkward as the baby in his arms. A stalk falls to the floor and then another. He waits for her to pick them up, to hand them to him. She waits for him to do it himself. In the end, it’s Kinsella who stoops. “There now,” he says.</p><p>Out in the yard, my father throws the rhubarb onto the back seat, gets in behind the wheel, and starts the engine. “Good luck to ye,” he says. “I hope this girl will give no trouble.” He turns to me. “Try not to fall into the fire, you.”</p><p>I watch him reverse, turn in to the lane, and drive away. Why did he leave without so much as a goodbye or ever mentioning<span data-page="page_3"></span> when he would come back for me?</p><p>“What’s ailing you, child?” the woman says.</p><p>I look at my feet, dirty in my sandals.</p><p>Kinsella stands in close. “Whatever it is, tell us. We won’t mind.”</p><p>“Lord God Almighty, didn’t he go and forget all about your wee bits and bobs!” the woman says. “No wonder you’re in a state. Well, hasn’t he a head like a sieve, the same man.”</p><p>“Not a word about it,” Kinsella says. “We’ll have you togged out in no time.”</p><p>When I follow the woman back inside, I want her to say something, to put me at ease. Instead, she clears the table, picks up the sharp knife, and stands at the window, washing the blade under the running tap. She stares at me as she wipes it clean and puts it away.</p><p>“Now, girleen,” she says. “I think it’s nearly time you had a bath.”</p><p>She takes me upstairs to a bathroom, plugs the drain, and turns the taps on full. “Hands up,” she says, and pulls my dress off.</p><p>She tests the water and I step in, trusting her, but the water is too hot, and I step back out.</p><p>“Get in,” she says.</p><p>“It’s too hot.”</p><p>“You’ll get used to it.”</p><p>I put one foot through the steam and feel, again, the same rough scald. I keep my foot in the water, and then, when I think I can’t stand it any longer, my thinking changes, and I can. The water is deeper than any I have ever bathed in. Our mother bathes us in what little she can, and makes us share. After a while, I lie back and through the steam watch the woman as she scrubs my feet. The dirt under my nails she scrapes out with tweezers. She squeezes shampoo from a plastic bottle, lathers my hair, and rinses the lather off. Then she makes me stand and soaps me all over with a cloth. Her hands are like my mother’s hands but there is something else in them, too, something I have never felt before and have no name for. This is a new place, and new words are needed.</p><p>“Now your clothes,” she says.</p><p>“I don’t have any clothes.”</p><p>“Of course you don’t.” She pauses. “Would some of our old things do you for now?”</p><p>“I don’t mind.”</p><p>“Good girl.”</p><p>She takes me to a bedroom, at the other side of the stairs, and looks through a chest of drawers.</p><p>“Maybe these will fit you.”</p><p>She is holding a pair of old-fashioned trousers and a new plaid shirt. The sleeves and legs are a bit too long but the waist tightens with a canvas belt, to fit me.</p><p>“There now,” she says.</p><p>“Mammy says I have to change my pants every day.”</p><p>“And what else does your mammy say?”</p><p>“She says you can keep me for as long as you like.”</p><p>She laughs at this and brushes the knots out of my hair, and turns quiet. The windows are open and I see a stretch of lawn, a vegetable garden, edible things growing in rows, spiky yellow dahlias, a crow with something in his beak which he slowly breaks in two and eats.</p><p>“Come down to the well with me,” she says.</p><p>“Now?”</p><p>“Does now not suit you?”</p><p>Something about the way she says this makes me wonder if it’s something that we are not supposed to do.</p><p>“Is this a secret?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“I mean, am I not supposed to tell?”</p><p>She turns me around, to face her. I have not really looked into her eyes until now. Her eyes are dark blue, pebbled with other blues. In this light she has a mustache.</p><p>“There are no secrets in this house, do you hear?”</p><p>I don’t want to answer back but feel she wants an answer.</p><p>“Do you hear me?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“It’s not ‘yeah.’ It’s ‘yes.’ What is it?”</p><p>“It’s yes.”</p><p>“Yes, what?”</p><p>“Yes, there are no secrets in this house.”</p><p>“Where there’s a secret,” she says, “there’s shame, and shame is something we can do without.”</p><p>“O.K.” I take big breaths so I won’t cry.</p><p>She puts her arm around me. “You’re just too young to understand.”</p><p>As she says this, I realize that she is just like everyone else, and I wish I was back at home so that the things that I do not understand could be the same as they always are.</p><p>Downstairs, she fetches a zinc bucket from the scullery. At first I feel uneasy in the strange clothes, but, walking along, I forget. Kinsella’s fields are broad and level, divided with electric fences that she says I must not touch, unless I want a shock. When the wind blows, sections of the longer grass bend over, turning silver. On one strip of land, bony Friesian cows stand all around us, grazing. They have huge bags of milk and long teats. I can hear them pulling the grass up from the roots. Neither one of us talks, the way people sometimes don’t, when they are happy. As soon as I have this thought, I realize that its opposite is also true. We climb over a stile and follow a dry path through the grass to a small iron gate, where stone steps run down to a well. The woman leaves the bucket on the grass and comes down with me.<span data-page="page_4"></span></p><p>“Look,” she says. “There’s not a finer well in the parish. Who’d ever know there wasn’t so much as a shower since the first of the month?”</p><p>I go down steps until I reach the water.</p><p>“Taste it,” she says.</p><p>Hanging above us is a big ladle, a shadow cupped in the steel. I reach up and take it from the nail. She holds the belt of my trousers so I won’t fall in.</p><p>“It’s deep,” she says. “Be careful.”</p><p>I dip the ladle and bring it to my lips. This water is as cool and clean as anything I have ever tasted. I dip it again and lift it level with the sunlight. I drink six measures of water and wish, for now, that this place without shame or secrets could be my home. She takes me back up the steps, then goes down alone. I hear the bucket floating on its side for a moment before it sinks and swallows, making a grateful sound, a glug, before it’s pulled out and lifted.</p><p>That night, I expect her to make me kneel down but instead she tucks me in and tells me that I can say a few little prayers in my bed, if that is what I ordinarily do. The light of the day is still bright and strong. She is just about to hang a blanket over the curtain rail, to block it out, when she pauses. “Would you rather I left it?”</p><p>“Yeah,” I say. “Yes.”</p><p>“Are you afraid of the dark?”</p><p>I want to say that I am afraid but am too afraid to say so.</p><p>“Never mind,” she says. “It doesn’t matter. You can use the toilet past our room but there’s a chamber pot here, too, if you’d prefer.”</p><p>“I’ll be all right,” I say.</p><p>“Is your mammy all right?”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“Your mammy. Is she all right?”</p><p>“She used to get sick in the mornings but now she doesn’t.”</p><p>“Why isn’t the hay in?”</p><p>“She hasn’t enough to pay the man. She only just paid him for last year.”</p><p>“God help her.” She smooths the sheet across me, sighs. “Do you think she’d be offended if I sent her a few bob?”</p><p>“What’s ‘offended?’ ”</p><p>“Would she mind?”</p><p>I think about this for a while. “She wouldn’t, but Da would.”</p><p>“Ah, yes,” she says. “Your father.”</p><p>She kisses me, a plain kiss, then says good night. I sit up when she is gone and look around the room. Trains of every color race across the wallpaper. There are no tracks for these trains, but, here and there, a small boy stands off in the distance, waving. He looks happy, but some part of me feels sorry for every version of him. I roll onto my side and, though I know that she wants neither, wonder if my mother will have a girl or a boy this time. I think of my sisters, who will not yet be in bed. I stay awake for as long as I can, then make myself get up and use the chamber pot, but only a dribble comes out. I go back to bed, more than half afraid, and fall asleep. At some point later in the night—it feels much later—the woman comes in. I grow still and breathe as though I have not wakened. I feel the mattress sinking, the weight of her on the bed. Quietly, she leans over me. “God help you, child. If you were mine, I’d never leave you alone with strangers.”</p><p>All through the day, I help the woman around the house. She shows me the big white machine that plugs in, a freezer, where what she calls “perishables” can be stored for months without rotting. We make ice cubes, go over every inch of the floors with a hoovering machine, dig new potatoes, make coleslaw and two loaves, and then she takes the clothes in off the line while they are still damp and sets up a board and starts ironing. She does it all without rushing but she never really stops. Kinsella comes in and makes tea for us out of the well water and drinks it standing up, with a handful of Kimberley biscuits, then goes back out. Later, he comes in again, looking for me. “Is the wee girl there?” he calls.</p><p>I go to the door.</p><p>“Can you run?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Are you fast on your feet?” he says.</p><p>“Sometimes,” I say.</p><p>“Well, run down there to the end of the lane, as far as the box, and run back.”</p><p>“The box?” I say.</p><p>“The postbox. You’ll see it there. Be as fast as you can.”</p><p>I take off, racing, to the end of the lane and find the box and get the letters and race back. Kinsella is looking at his watch. “Not bad,” he says, “for your first time.”</p><p>He takes the letters from me. “Do you think there’s money in any of these?”</p><p>“I don’t know.”</p><p>“Ah, you’d know if there was, surely. The women can smell money. Do you think there’s news?”</p><p>“I wouldn’t know,” I say.</p><p>“Do you think there’s a wedding invitation?”</p><p>I want to laugh.</p><p>“It wouldn’t be yours anyhow,” he says. “You’re too young to be getting married. Do you think you’ll get married?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” I say. “Mammy says I<span data-page="page_5"></span> shouldn’t take a present off a man.”</p><p>Kinsella laughs. “She could be right there. Still and all, there’s no two men the same. And it’d be a swift man that would catch you, Long Legs. We’ll try you again tomorrow and see if we can’t improve your time.”</p><p>“I’ve to go faster?”</p><p>“Oh, aye,” he says. “By the time you’re ready for home you’re to be as fast as a reindeer, so there’ll not be a man in the parish will catch you without a long-handled net and a racing bike.”</p><p>After supper and the nine-o’clock news, when Kinsella is reading his newspaper in the parlor, the woman sits me on her lap and idly strokes my bare feet.</p><p>“You have nice long toes,” she says. “Nice feet.”</p><p>She makes me lie down with my head on her lap and, with a hair clip, cleans the wax out of my ears.</p><p>“You could have planted a geranium in what was there,” she says.</p><p>When she takes out the hairbrush, I can hear her counting under her breath to a hundred before she stops and plaits it loosely.</p><p>And so the days pass. I keep waiting for something to happen, for the ease I feel to end, but each day follows on much like the one before. We wake early with the sun coming in and have eggs of one kind or another with porridge and toast for breakfast. Kinsella puts on his cap and goes out to the yard to milk the cows, and myself and the woman make a list out loud of the jobs that need to be done: we pull rhubarb, make tarts, paint the skirting boards, take all the bedclothes out of the hot-press, hoover out the spiderwebs, and put all the clothes back in again, make scones, scrub the bathtub, sweep the staircase, polish the furniture, boil onions for onion sauce and put it in containers in the freezer, weed the flower beds, and, when the sun goes down, water things. Then it’s a matter of supper and the walk across the fields to the well. Every evening, the television is turned on for the nine-o’clock news and then, after the forecast, I am told that it is time for bed.</p><p>One afternoon, while we are topping and tailing gooseberries for jam, Kinsella comes in from the yard and washes and dries his hands and looks at me in a way he has never looked before.</p><p>“I think it’s past time we got you togged out, girl.”</p><p>I am wearing a pair of navy-blue trousers and a blue shirt that the woman pulled out of the chest of drawers.</p><p>“What’s wrong with her?” the woman says.</p><p>“Tomorrow’s Sunday, and she’ll need something more than that for Mass,” he says. “I’ll not have her going as she went last week.”</p><p>“Sure, isn’t she clean and tidy?”</p><p>“You know what I’m talking about, Edna.” He sighs. “Why don’t you go up and change and I’ll run us into Gorey.”</p><p>The woman keeps on picking the gooseberries from the colander, stretching her hand out, but a little more slowly each time, for the next one. At one point I think she will stop, but she keeps on until she is finished and then she gets up and places the colander on the sink and lets out a sound I’ve never heard anyone make, and slowly goes upstairs.</p><p>Kinsella looks at me and smiles a hard kind of a smile. His eyes are not quite still in his head. It’s as though there is a big piece of trouble stretching itself out in the back of his mind. He toes the leg of a chair and looks over at me. “You should wash your hands and face before you go to town,” he says. “Didn’t your father even bother to teach you that much?”</p><p>I freeze in the chair, waiting for something much worse to happen, but Kinsella just stands there, locked in the wash of his own speech. As soon as he turns, I race for the stairs, but when I reach the bathroom the door won’t open.</p><p>“It’s all right,” the woman says after a while from inside, and then, shortly afterward, opens it. “Sorry for keeping you.” She has been crying but she isn’t ashamed. “It’ll be nice for you to have some clothes of your own,” she says then, wiping her eyes. “And Gorey is a nice town. I don’t know why I didn’t think of taking you there before now.”</p><p>Town is a crowded place with a wide main street. Outside the shops, many different things are hanging in the sun. There are plastic nets full of beach balls, blow-up toys, and beds that float. A see-through dolphin looks as though he is shivering in a cold breeze. There are plastic spades and matching buckets, molds for sandcastles, grown men digging ice cream out of tubs with little plastic spoons, a van with a man calling, “Fresh fish!”</p><p>Kinsella reaches into his pocket and hands me something. “You’ll get a choc-ice out of that.”</p><p>I open my hand and stare at the pound note.</p><p>“Couldn’t she buy half a dozen choc-ices out of that,” the woman says.</p><p>“Ah, what is she for, only for spoiling?” Kinsella says.</p><p>“What do you say?” the woman says.</p><p>“Thanks,” I say. “Thank you.”</p><p>“Well, stretch it out<span data-page="page_6"></span> and spend it well,” Kinsella says, laughing.</p><p>The woman takes me to the draper’s and picks out five cotton dresses and some pants and trousers and a few tops. We go behind a curtain so that I can try them on.</p><p>“Isn’t she tall?” the assistant says.</p><p>“We’re all tall,” the woman says.</p><p>“She’s the spit and image of her mammy. I can see it now,” the assistant says, and then decides that the lilac dress is the best fit and the most flattering. Mrs. Kinsella agrees. She buys me a printed blouse, too, with short sleeves, blue trousers, and a pair of black leather shoes with a little strap and a buckle, some pants, and white ankle socks. The assistant hands her the docket, and she takes out her purse and pays for it all.</p><p>“Well may you wear,” the assistant says. “Isn’t your mammy good to you?”</p><p>I don’t know how to answer.</p><p>Out in the street, the sun feels strong again, blinding. We meet people the woman knows. Some of them stare at me and ask who I am. One has a new baby in a pushchair. The woman bends down and coos, and he slobbers a little and starts to cry.</p><p>“He’s making strange,” the mother says. “Don’t you mind.”</p><p>We meet a woman with eyes like picks, who asks whose child I am. When she is told, she says, “Ah, isn’t she company for you all the same, God help you.”</p><p>Mrs. Kinsella stiffens, then says, “You must excuse me but this man of mine is waiting, and you know what these men are like.”</p><p>“Like fecking bulls, they are,” the woman says. “Haven’t an ounce of patience.”</p><p>“God forgive me but if I ever run into that woman again it will be too soon,” Mrs. Kinsella says, when we have rounded the corner.</p><p>Before we go back to the car she leaves me loose in a sweetshop. I take my time choosing what I want.</p><p>“You got a right load there,” she says, when I come out.</p><p>Kinsella has parked in the shade and is sitting with the windows open, reading the newspaper. “Well?” he says. “Did ye get sorted?”</p><p>“Aye,” she says.</p><p>“Grand,” he says.</p><p>I give him the choc-ice and her the Flake and lie on the back seat eating the wine gums, careful not to choke as we cross over bumps in the road. I listen to all the change rattling around in my pocket, the wind rushing through the car, and the little pieces of speech, scraps of gossip, being shared between them in the front.</p><p>When we turn in to the yard, another car is parked outside the door. A woman is on the front step, pacing, with her arms crossed.</p><p>“Isn’t that Harry Redmond’s girl?”</p><p>“I don’t like the look of this,” Kinsella says.</p><p>“Oh, John,” she says, rushing over. “I’m sorry to trouble you but didn’t our Michael pass away and there’s not a soul at home. They’re all out on the combines and won’t be back till God knows what hour, and I’ve no way of getting word to them. We’re rightly stuck. Would you ever come down and give us a hand digging the grave?”</p><p>“I don’t know that this’ll be any place for you but I can’t leave you here,” the woman says, later the same day. “So get ready and we’ll go, in the name of God.”</p><p>I go upstairs and change into my new dress and my ankle socks and shoes.</p><p>“Don’t you look nice,” she says, when I come down. “John’s not always easy but he’s hardly ever wrong.”</p><p>Walking down the road, we pass houses with their doors and windows wide open, long, flapping clotheslines, gravelled entrances to other lanes. Outside a cottage, a black dog with curls all down his back comes out and barks at us, hotly, through the bars of a gate. At the first crossroads, we meet a heifer, who panics and races past us, lost. All through the walk, the wind blows hard and soft and hard again, through the tall, flowering hedges, the high trees. In the fields, the combines are out cutting the wheat, the barley, and the oats, saving the corn, leaving behind long rows of straw. Farther along, we meet two bare-chested men, their eyes so white in faces that are tanned and dusty. The woman stops to greet them and tells them where we are going.</p><p>“Well, it must be a relief to the man, to be out of his misery.”</p><p>“Sure, didn’t he reach his three score and ten?” the other says. “What more can any of us hope for?”</p><p>We keep on walking, standing in tight to the hedges, the ditches, letting things pass.</p><p>“Have you been to a wake before?” the woman asks.</p><p>“I don’t think so.”</p><p>“Well, I might as well tell you. There will be a dead man in a coffin and lots of people and some of them might have a little too much taken.”</p><p>“What will they be taking?”</p><p>“Drink,” she says.</p><p>When we come to the house, several men are leaning against a low wall, smoking. There’s a black ribbon on the door, but, when we go in, the kitchen is bright and packed with people who are talking. The woman who asked Kinsella to dig the grave is there, making<span data-page="page_7"></span> sandwiches. There are bottles of red and white lemonade and stout, and, in the middle of all this, a big wooden box with a dead old man lying inside it. His hands are joined, as though he had died praying, a string of rosary beads around his fingers. Some of the men are sitting around the coffin, using the part that’s closed as a counter on which to rest their glasses. One of these is Kinsella.</p><p>“There she is,” he says. “Long Legs. Come over here.”</p><p>He pulls me onto his lap, and gives me a sip from his glass. “Do you like the taste of that?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>He laughs. “Good girl. Don’t ever get a taste for it. If you start, you might never stop, and then you’d wind up like the rest of us.”</p><p>He pours red lemonade into a cup for me. I sit on his lap, drinking it and eating queen cakes out of the biscuit tin and looking at the dead man, hoping that his eyes will open.</p><p>The people drift in and out, shaking hands, drinking and eating and looking at the dead man, saying what a lovely corpse he is, and doesn’t he look happy now that his agony is over, and who was it who laid him out? They talk of the forecast and the moisture content of corn, of milk quotas and the next general election. I feel myself getting heavy on Kinsella’s lap. “Am I getting heavy?”</p><p>“Heavy?” he says. “You’re like a feather, child. Stay where you are.”</p><p>I put my head against him but I’m bored and wish there were things to do, other girls who would play.</p><p>“She’s getting uneasy,” I hear the woman say.</p><p>“What’s ailing her?” another says.</p><p>“Ah, it’s no place for the child, really,” she says. “It’s just I didn’t like not to come, and I wouldn’t leave her behind.”</p><p>“Sure, I’ll take her home with me, Edna. I’m going now. Can’t you call in and collect her on your way?”</p><p>“Oh,” she says. “I don’t know should I.”</p><p>“Mine’d be a bit of company for her. Can’t they play away out the back? And that man there won’t budge as long as he has her on his knee.”</p><p>Mrs. Kinsella laughs. I have never really heard her laugh till now.</p><p>“Sure, maybe, if you don’t mind, Mildred,” she says. “What harm is in it? And we’ll not be long after you.”</p><p>“Not a bother,” Mildred says.</p><p>When we are out on the road, and the goodbyes are said, Mildred strides on into a pace I can just about keep, and as soon as she rounds the bend the questions start. Hardly is one answered before the next is fired: “Which room did they put you into? Did Kinsella give you money? How much? Does she drink at night? Does he? Are they playing cards up there much? Do ye say the Rosary? Does she put butter or margarine in her pastry? Where does the old dog sleep? Is the freezer packed solid? Does she skimp on things or is she allowed to spend? Are the child’s clothes still hanging in the wardrobe?”</p><p>I answer them all easily, until the last. “The child’s clothes?”</p><p>“Aye,” she says. “If you’re sleeping in his room you must surely know. Did you not look?”</p><p>“Well, she had clothes I wore for all the time I was here, but we went to Gorey this morning and bought new things.”</p><p>“This rig-out you’re wearing now? God Almighty,” she says. “Anybody would think you were going on for a hundred.”</p><p>“I like it,” I say. “They told me it was flattering.”</p><p>“Flattering, is it? Well. Well,” she says. “I suppose it is, after living in the dead’s clothes all this time.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“The Kinsellas’ young lad, you dope. Did you not know?”</p><p>I don’t know what to say.</p><p>“That must have been some stone they rolled back to find you. Sure, didn’t he follow that auld hound of theirs into the slurry tank and drown? That’s what they say happened anyhow,” she says.</p><p>I keep on walking and try not to think about what she has said, even though I can think of little else. The time for the sun to go down is hours from now but the day feels like it is ending. I look at the sky and see the sun, still high, and, far away, a round moon coming out.</p><p>“They say John got the gun and took the hound down the field but he hadn’t the heart to shoot him, the softhearted fool.”</p><p>We walk on between the bristling hedges, in which small things seem to rustle and move. Chamomile grows along these ditches, wood sage and mint, plants whose names my mother somehow found the time to teach me. Farther along, the same heifer is still lost, in a different part of the road. Soon we come to the place where the black dog is barking through the gate. “Shut up and get in, you,” she says to him.</p><p>It’s a cottage she lives in, with uneven slabs of concrete outside the front door, overgrown shrubs and red-hot pokers growing tall. Here I must watch my head, my step. When we go in, the place is cluttered and an older woman is smoking at the cooker. There’s a baby in a high chair.<span data-page="page_8"></span> He lets out a cry when he sees the woman and drops a handful of marrowfat peas over the edge. “Look at you,” she says. “The state of you.”</p><p>I’m not sure if it’s the woman or the child she is talking to. She takes off her cardigan and sits down and starts talking about the wake: who was there, the type of sandwiches that were made, the queen cakes, the corpse who was lying up crooked in the coffin and hadn’t even been shaved properly, how they had plastic rosary beads for him, the poor fucker.</p><p>I don’t know whether to sit or stand, to listen or leave, but just as I’m deciding what to do the dog barks and the gate opens and Kinsella comes in, stooping under the doorframe. “Good evening all,” he says.</p><p>“Ah, John,” the woman says. “You weren’t long. We’re only in the door. Aren’t we only in the door, child?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Kinsella hasn’t taken his eyes off me. “Thanks, Mildred. It was good of you to take her home.”</p><p>“It was nothing,” the woman says. “She’s a quiet young one, this.”</p><p>“She says what she has to say, and no more. May there be many like her,” he says. “Are you ready to come home, Petal?”</p><p>I follow him out to the car, where the woman is waiting. “Were you all right in there?” she says.</p><p>I say I was.</p><p>“Did she ask you anything?”</p><p>“A few things, nothing much.”</p><p>“What did she ask you?”</p><p>“She asked me if you used butter or margarine in your pastry.”</p><p>“Did she ask you anything else?”</p><p>“She asked me was the freezer packed tight.”</p><p>“There you are,” Kinsella says.</p><p>“Did she tell you anything?” the woman asks.</p><p>I don’t know what to say.</p><p>“What did she tell you?”</p><p>“She told me you had a little boy who followed the dog into the slurry tank and died, and that I wore his clothes to Mass last Sunday.”</p><p>When we get home, the hound comes out to the car to greet us, and I realize that I’ve not yet heard either one of them call him by his name. Kinsella sighs and goes off, stumbling a little, to milk. When he comes inside, he says he’s not ready for bed. He puts what I realize is the boy’s jacket on me.</p><p>“What are you doing now?” the woman says.</p><p>“I’m taking her as far as the strand.”</p><p>“You’ll be careful with that girl, John Kinsella,” she says. “And don’t you go without the lamp.”</p><p>“What need is there for a lamp on a night like tonight?” he says, but he takes it anyhow, as it’s handed to him.</p><p>There’s a big moon shining on the yard, chalking our way onto the lane and along the road. Kinsella takes my hand in his. As he does it, I realize that my father has never once held my hand, and some part of me wants Kinsella to let me go, so that I won’t have to think about this. It’s a hard feeling but, as we walk along, I settle and let the difference between my life at home and the one I have here be.</p><p>When we reach the crossroads, we turn right, down a steep hill. The wind is high and hoarse in the trees, tearing fretfully, making the dry boughs rise and swing. It’s sweet to feel the open road falling away under us, knowing that we will, at its end, come to the sea. Kinsella says a few meaningless things along the way, then falls quiet, and time passes without seeming to pass, and then we are in a sandy, open space where people must park their cars. It is full of tire marks and potholes, a rubbish bin that seems not to have been emptied in a long time.</p><p>“We’re almost there now, Petal.”</p><p>He leads me up a hill, where tall rushes bend and shake. Then we are standing on the crest of a dark place where the land ends and there is a long strand and water, which I know is deep and stretches all the way to England. Far out, in the darkness, two bright lights are blinking.</p><p>Kinsella lets me go and I race down the dune to the place where the black sea hisses up into loud, frothy waves. I run toward them as they back away, and run back, shrieking, when they crash in. Kinsella catches up and takes my shoes off, then his own. We walk along the edge of the sea as it claws at the sand under our bare feet. At one point, he holds me on his shoulders and we go in until the water is up to his knees. Then he walks me back to the tide line, where the dunes begin. Many things have washed up here: plastic bottles, sticks and floats, and, farther on, a stable door whose bolt is broken.</p><p>“Some man’s horse is loose tonight,” Kinsella says. “You know the fishermen sometimes find horses out at sea. A man I know towed a colt in once and the horse lay down for a long time and then got up. And he was perfect.</p><p>“Strange things happen,” he says. “A strange thing happened to you tonight, but Edna meant no harm. It’s too good, she is.<span data-page="page_9"></span> She wants to believe in the good in others, and sometimes her way of finding out is to trust them, hoping she’ll not be disappointed, but she sometimes is.”</p><p>I don’t know how to answer.</p><p>“You don’t ever have to say anything,” he says. “Always remember that. Many’s the man lost much just because he missed a perfect opportunity to say nothing.”</p><p>He laughs then, a queer, sad laugh.</p><p>Everything about the night feels strange: to walk to a sea that’s always been there, to see it and feel it and fear it in the half-dark, to listen to this man telling me things—about horses being towed in from the deep, about his wife trusting others so she’ll learn whom not to trust—things that I don’t fully understand, things that may not even be intended for me.</p><p>As we turn to head back along the beach, the moon disappears behind a cloud and we cannot see where we are going. At this point, Kinsella lets out a sigh, stops, and lights the lamp.</p><p>“Ah, the women are nearly always right, all the same,” he says. “Do you know what the women have a gift for?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Eventualities. A good woman can look far down the line and smell what’s coming before a man even gets a sniff of it.”</p><p>He shines the light along the strand to find our footprints and follow them back, but the only prints he can find are mine. “You must have carried me there,” he says.</p><p>I laugh at the thought of my carrying him, at the impossibility, then realize that it was a joke, and I got it.</p><p>When the moon comes out again, he turns the lamp off and we easily find the path we took through the dunes. We stop at the top and he puts my shoes back on and then his own and knots the laces. We turn and look at the water.</p><p>“See, there’s three lights there now, where there was only two before.”</p><p>I look out across the sea. There, the two lights are still blinking, but with another, steady light, shining in between.</p><p>“Can you see it?” he says.</p><p>“I can,” I say. “It’s there.”</p><p>And that is when he puts his arms around me and gathers me into them as though I were his.</p><p>After a week of rain, on a Thursday, the letter comes. It is not so much a surprise as a shock. Already I have seen the signs: the shampoo for head lice in the chemist’s shop, the fine-tooth combs. In the gift gallery there are copybooks stacked high, Biros, rulers, mechanical-drawing sets. In the hardware, the lunchboxes and satchels and hurling sticks are left out front, where the women can see them.</p><p>We come home and take soup, dipping our bread, breaking it, slurping a little, now that we know one another. Afterward, I go with Kinsella out to the hay shed, where he makes me promise not to look while he is welding. I am following him around, I realize, but I cannot help it. It is past the time for the post to come but he does not suggest that I fetch it until evening, after the cows are milked and the milking parlor is swept and scrubbed. “I think it’s time,” he says, washing his boots with the hose.</p><p>I get into position, using the front step as a starting block. Kinsella looks at the watch and pulls down his handkerchief as if it was a flag. I race down the yard to the lane, make a tight corner, open the box, get the letters, and race back to the step, knowing that my time was not as fast as yesterday’s.</p><p>“Nineteen seconds faster than your first run,” Kinsella says. “And a two-second improvement on yesterday, despite the heavy ground. It’s like the wind, you are.” He takes the letters and goes through them, but today, instead of making jokes about what’s inside of each, he pauses.</p><p>“Is that from Mammy?”</p><p>“You know,” he says, “I think it could be.”</p><p>“Do I have to go home?”</p><p>“Well, it’s addressed to Edna, so why don’t we give it in to her and let her read it.”</p><p>We go into the parlor, where she is sitting with her feet up, looking through a book of knitting patterns. Kinsella slides the letter onto her lap. She opens it and reads it. It’s one small sheet with writing on both sides. She puts it down, then picks it up and reads it again.</p><p>“Well,” she says, “you have a new brother. Nine pounds two ounces. And school starts on Monday. Your mother has asked us to leave you up at the weekend so she can get you togged out and all.”</p><p>“I have to go back, then?”</p><p>“Aye,” she says. “But sure didn’t you know that?”</p><p>I nod.</p><p>“You couldn’t stay here forever with us two old forgeries.”</p><p>I stand there and stare at the fire, trying not to cry. I don’t so much hear as feel Kinsella leaving the room.</p><p>“Don’t upset yourself,” the woman says. “Come over here.”</p><p>She shows me pages with knitted jumpers and asks me which pattern I like best, but all the patterns seem to blur together and I just point to one, a blue one, that looks like it might be easy.</p><p>“Well, you would<span data-page="page_10"></span> pick the hardest one in the book,” she says. “I’d better get started on that this week or you’ll be too big for it by the time it’s knitted.”</p><p>Now that I know I must go home, I almost want to go. I wake earlier than usual and look out at the wet fields, the dripping trees, the hills, which seem greener than they did when I came. Kinsella hangs around all day, doing things but not really finishing anything. He says that he has no disks for his angle grinder, no welding rods, and he cannot find the vise grip. He says that he got so many jobs done in the long stretch of fine weather that there’s little left to do.</p><p>We are out looking at the calves, who have been fed. With warm water, Kinsella has made up their milk replacement, which they suck from long rubber teats. They look content lying there in a fresh bed of straw.</p><p>“Could ye leave me back this evening?”</p><p>“This evening?” Kinsella says.</p><p>I nod.</p><p>“Any evening suits me,” he says. “I’ll take you whenever you want, Petal.”</p><p>I look at the day. It is like any other, with a flat gray sky hanging over the yard and the wet hound on watch outside the front door.</p><p>“Well, I had better milk early, so,” he says. “Right.” And goes on down the yard past me as though I am already gone.</p><p>The woman gives me a brown leather bag. “You can keep this old thing,” she says. “I never have a use for it.”</p><p>We fold my clothes and place them inside, along with the Ladybird books we found on the stand at Webb’s in Gorey: “The Three Billy Goats Gruff,” “The Ugly Duckling,” “Snow-White and Rose-Red.” I can remember how the lines go, can match my memory of the words with the words that are written there. She gives me a bar of yellow soap and my facecloth, and the hairbrush she bought for me. As we gather all these things together, I remember where we got them, what was said, the days we spent, and how the sun, for most of the time, was shining.</p><p>Just then a car pulls into the yard. I am afraid to look, afraid it is my father, but it’s a neighboring man. “Edna,” he says, in a panic. “Is John about?”</p><p>“He’s out at the milking,” she says. “He should be finishing up now.”</p><p>He runs across the yard, heavy in his Wellington boots, and minutes later Kinsella sticks his head around the door. “Joe Fortune needs a hand pulling a calf,” he says. “Would you ever run out and finish the parlor off? I have the herd out.”</p><p>“I will, surely,” she says.</p><p>“I’ll be back just as soon as I can.”</p><p>“Don’t I know you will.”</p><p>She puts on her anorak and I watch her go down the yard. I wonder if I should go out to help but I come to the conclusion that I’d only be in the way. I sit in the armchair and look out to where a watery light is shining off the zinc bucket in the scullery. I could go to the well for water for her tea. It could be the last thing I do.</p><p>I put on the boy’s jacket, take up the bucket, and walk down the fields. I know the way, could find the well with my eyes closed. When I cross the stile, the path does not look like the same path we followed on that first evening here. The way is muddy now and slippery in places. I trudge on along toward the little iron gate and down the steps. The water is much higher these days. I was on the fifth step that first evening here, but now I stand on the first and see the surface of the water reaching up and just about sucking the edge of the step that’s one down from me. I bend with the bucket, letting it float then sink, as the woman does, but when I reach out to lift it another hand just like mine seems to come out of the water and pull me in.</p><p>It is not that evening or the following one but the evening after, on the Sunday, that I am taken home. When I come back from the well, soaked to the skin, the woman takes one look at me and turns very still before she gathers me up and takes me inside and makes up my bed again.</p><p>The following morning, I do not feel hot, but she keeps me upstairs, bringing me warm drinks with lemon and cloves and honey, aspirin.</p><p>“ ’Tis nothing but a chill, she has,” I hear Kinsella say.</p><p>“When I think of what could have happened.”</p><p>“If you’ve said that once, you’ve said it a hundred times.”</p><p>“But—”</p><p>“Nothing happened, and the girl is grand. And that’s the end of it.”</p><p>I lie there with the hot-water bottle, listening to the rain and looking through my books, making up something slightly different to happen at the end of each, each time.</p><p>On Sunday, I am allowed to get up, and we pack everything again, as before. Toward evening, we have supper, and wash and change into our good clothes. The sun has come out, is<span data-page="page_11"></span> lingering in long, cool slants, and the yard is dry in places. Sooner than I would like, we are ready and in the car, turning down the lane, going up through Gorey and on, along the narrow roads through Carnew and Shillelagh.</p><p>“That’s where Da lost the red heifer playing cards,” I say.</p><p>“Wasn’t that some wager?” the woman says.</p><p>“It was some loss for him,” Kinsella says.</p><p>When we get to our lane, the gates are closed and Kinsella gets out to open them, then closes them behind us, and drives on very slowly to the house. I feel, now, that the woman is trying to make up her mind whether she should say something to me, but I don’t really have any idea what it is, and she gives me no clue. The car stops in front of the house, the dogs bark, and my sisters race out. I see my mother through the window, with what is now the second youngest in her arms.</p><p>Inside, the house feels damp and cold. The lino is tracked over with dirty footprints. Mammy stands there with my little brother, and looks at me. “You’ve grown,” she says.</p><p>“Yes,” I say.</p><p>“ ‘Yes,’ is it?” she says, and raises her eyebrows.</p><p>She bids the Kinsellas good evening and tells them to sit down—if they can find a place to sit—and fills the kettle from the bucket under the kitchen table. We move playthings off the car seat under the window, and sit down. Mugs are taken off the dresser, a loaf of bread is sliced, butter and jam left out.</p><p>“Oh, I brought you jam,” the woman says. “Don’t let me forget to give it to you, Mary.”</p><p>“I made this out of the rhubarb you sent down,” Ma says. “That’s the last of it.”</p><p>“I should have brought more,” the woman says. “I wasn’t thinking.”</p><p>“Where’s the new addition?” Kinsella asks.</p><p>“Oh, he’s up in the room there. You’ll hear him soon enough.”</p><p>“Is he sleeping through the night for you?”</p><p>“On and off,” Ma says. “The same child could crow at any hour.”</p><p>My sisters look at me as though I am an English cousin, coming over to touch my dress, the buckles on my shoes. They seem different, thinner, and have nothing to say. We sit in to the table and eat the bread and drink the tea. When a cry is heard from upstairs, Ma gives my brother to Mrs. Kinsella, and goes up to fetch the baby. He is pink and crying, his fists tight. He looks bigger than the last, stronger.</p><p>“Isn’t there a fine child, God bless him,” Kinsella says.</p><p>Ma pours more tea with one hand and sits down and takes her breast out for the baby. Her doing this in front of Kinsella makes me blush. Seeing me blush, Ma gives me a long, deep look.</p><p>“No sign of himself?” Kinsella says.</p><p>“He went out there earlier, wherever he’s gone,” Ma says.</p><p>A little bit of talk starts up then, little balls of speech they seem to kick uneasily back and forth. Soon after, a car is heard outside. Nothing more is said until my father appears, and throws his hat on the dresser.</p><p>“Evening, all,” he says.</p><p>“Dan,” Kinsella says.</p><p>“Ah, there’s the prodigal child,” he says. “You came back to us, did you?”</p><p>I say I did.</p><p>“Did she give trouble?”</p><p>“Trouble?” Kinsella says. “Good as gold, she was, the same girl.”</p><p>“Is that so?” Da says, sitting down. “Well, isn’t that a relief.”</p><p>“You’ll want to sit in,” Mrs. Kinsella says, “and get your supper.”</p><p>“I had a liquid supper,” Da says, “down in Parkbridge.”</p><p>I sneeze then, and reach into my pocket for my handkerchief, and blow my nose.</p><p>“Have you caught cold?” Ma asks.</p><p>“No,” I say, hoarsely.</p><p>“You haven’t?”</p><p>“Nothing happened.”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“I didn’t catch cold,” I say.</p><p>“I see,” she says, giving me another deep look.</p><p>“The child’s been in bed for the last couple of days,” Kinsella says. “Didn’t she catch herself a wee chill.”</p><p>“Aye,” Da says. “You couldn’t mind them. You know yourself.”</p><p>“Dan,” Ma says, in a steel voice.</p><p>Mrs. Kinsella looks uneasy.</p><p>“You know, I think it’s nearly time that we were making tracks,” Kinsella says. “It’s a long road home.”</p><p>“Ah, what’s the big hurry?” Ma says.</p><p>“No hurry at all, Mary, just the usual. These cows don’t give you any opportunity to have a lie-in.”</p><p>He gets up then and takes my little brother from his wife and gives him to my father. My father takes the child and looks across at the baby suckling. I sneeze and blow my nose again.</p><p>“That’s a right dose you came home with,” Da says.</p><p>“It’s nothing she hasn’t caught before and won’t catch again,” Ma says. “Sure, isn’t it going around?”</p><p>“Are you ready for home?” Kinsella asks.</p><p>Mrs. Kinsella stands then, and they say their goodbyes. I follow them out to the car with my mother, who still has the baby in her arms. Mrs. Kinsella takes out the cardboard box with the pots of jam. Kinsella lifts a four-stone sack of potatoes out of the boot. “These are floury,” he says. “Queens they are, Mary.”</p><p>My mother thanks them, saying it was a lovely thing they did, to keep me.</p><p>“The girl was welcome and<span data-page="page_final"></span> is welcome again, anytime,” the woman says.</p><p>“She’s a credit to you, Mary,” Kinsella says. “You keep your head in the books,” he says to me. “I want to see gold stars on them copybooks next time I come up here.” He gives me a kiss then, and the woman hugs me. I watch them getting into the car and closing the doors and I feel a start when the engine turns and the car begins to move away.</p><p>“What happened at all?” Ma says, now that the car is gone.</p><p>“Nothing,” I say.</p><p>“Tell me.”</p><p>“Nothing happened.” This is my mother I am speaking to but I have learned enough, grown enough, to know that what happened is not something I need ever mention. It is my perfect opportunity to say nothing.</p><p>I hear the car braking on the gravel in the lane, the door opening, and then I am doing what I do best. It’s nothing I have to think about. I take off from standing and race on down the lane. My heart feels not so much in my chest as in my hands. I am carrying it along swiftly, as though I have become the messenger for what is going on inside me. Several things flash through my mind: the boy on the wallpaper, the gooseberries, that moment when the bucket pulled me under, the lost heifer, the third light on the water. I think of my summer, of now, of a tomorrow that I can’t entirely believe in.</p><p>As I am rounding the bend, reaching the point where I daren’t look, I see him there, closing the gate, putting the clamp back on. His eyes are down, and he seems to be looking at his hands, at what he is doing. My feet batter on along the rough gravel, the strip of tatty grass in the middle of our lane. There is only one thing I care about now, and my feet are carrying me there. As soon as he sees me, he grows still. By the time I reach him, the gate is open and I am smack against him and lifted into his arms. For a long stretch, he holds me tight. I feel the thumping of my heart, my breaths coming out, then my heart and my breaths settling differently. At a point, which feels much later, a sudden gust blows through the trees and shakes big, fat raindrops over us. My eyes are closed now and I can feel him, the heat of him coming through his good clothes, can smell the soap on his neck. When I finally open my eyes and look over his shoulder, it is my father I see, coming along strong and steady, his walking stick in his hand. I hold on as though I’ll drown if I let go, and listen to the woman, who seems, in her throat, to be taking it in turns sobbing and crying, as though she is crying not for one but for two now. I daren’t keep my eyes open and yet I do, staring up the lane, past Kinsella’s shoulder, seeing what he can’t. If some part of me wants with all my heart to get down and tell the woman who has minded me so well that I will never, never tell, something deeper keeps me there in Kinsella’s arms, holding on.</p><p>“Daddy,” I keep calling him, keep warning him. “Daddy.” ♦</p>	Claire Keegan	February 15, 2010 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/02/15/foster	Boys	Cattle	Children	Clothing	Cold	Dead	Unnamed	First	Children
Funny Little Snake	<p>The child was nine years old and couldn’t fasten her own buttons. Valerie knelt in front of her on the carpet in the spare room as Robyn held out first one cuff and then the other without a word, then turned around to present the back of her dress, where a long row of spherical chocolate-brown buttons was unfastened over a grubby white petticoat edged with lace. Her tiny, bony shoulder blades flickered with repressed movement. And although every night since Robyn had arrived, a week ago, Valerie had encouraged her into a bath foamed up with bubbles, she still smelled of something furtive—musty spice from the back of a cupboard. The smell had to be in her dress, which Valerie didn’t dare wash because it looked as though it had to be dry-cleaned, or in her lank, licorice-colored hair, which was pulled back from her forehead under an even grubbier stretch Alice band. Trust Robyn’s mother to have a child who couldn’t do up buttons, and then put her in a fancy plaid dress with hundreds of them, and frogging and leg-of-mutton sleeves, like a Victorian orphan, instead of ordinary slacks and a T-shirt so that she could play. The mother went around, apparently, in long dresses and bare feet, and had her picture painted by artists. Robyn at least had tights and plimsolls with elastic tops—though her green coat was too thin for the winter weather.</p><p>Valerie had tried to talk to her stepdaughter. It was the first time they’d met, and she’d braced herself for resentment, the child’s mind poisoned against her. Robyn was miniature, a doll—with a plain, pale, wide face, her temples blue-naked where her hair was strained back, her wide-open gray eyes affronted and evasive and set too far apart. She wasn’t naughty, and she wasn’t actually silent—that would have been a form of stubbornness to combat, to coax and maneuver around. She was a nullity, an absence, answering yes and no obediently if she was questioned, in that languid drawl that always caught Valerie on the raw—though she knew the accent wasn’t the child’s fault, only what she’d learned. Robyn even said please and thank you, and she told Valerie the name of her teacher, but when Valerie asked whether she liked the teacher her eyes slipped uneasily away from her stepmother’s and she shrugged, as if such an idea as liking or not liking hadn’t occurred to her. The only dislikes she was definite about had to do with eating. When Valerie put fish pie on Robyn’s plate the first night, she shot her a direct look of such piercing desperation that Valerie, who was a good, wholesome cook and had been going to insist, asked her kindly what she ate at home. Eggs? Cottage pie? Baked beans?</p><p>Honestly, the girl hardly seemed to know the names of things. Toast was all she could think of. Definitely not eggs: a vehement head shake. Toast, and—after long consideration, then murmuring hesitantly, tonelessly—tomato soup, cornflakes, butterscotch Instant Whip. It was lucky that Gil wasn’t witness to all this compromise, because he would have thought Valerie was spoiling his daughter. He and Valerie ate together later, after Robyn was in bed. Gil might have been a left-winger in his politics, but he was old-fashioned in his values at home. He despised, for instance, the little box of a house the university had given them, and wanted to move into one of the rambling old mansions on the road behind his office. He thought they had more style, with their peeling paint and big gardens overgrown with trees.</p><p>Valerie didn’t tell him how much she enjoyed all the conveniences of their modern home—the clean, light rooms, the central heating, the electric tin opener fitted onto the kitchen wall. And she was intrigued, because Gil was old-fashioned, by his having chosen for his first wife a woman who went barefoot and lived like a hippie in her big Chelsea flat. Perhaps Marise had been so beautiful once that Gil couldn’t resist her. Valerie was twenty-four; she didn’t think Marise could still be beautiful at forty. Now, anyway, he referred to her as the Rattrap, and the Beak, and the Bitch from Hell, and said that she would fuck anyone. When Valerie first married him, she hadn’t believed that a professor could know such words. She’d known them herself, of course, but that was different—she wasn’t educated.</p><p>On the phone with his ex-wife, Gil had made a lot of fuss about having his daughter to visit, as a stubborn point of pride, and then had driven all the way down to London to fetch her. But, since getting back, he’d spent every day at his office at the university, even though it wasn’t term time, saying that he needed absolute concentration to work on the book he was writing. Robyn didn’t seem to miss him. She looked bemused when Valerie called him her daddy, as if she hardly recognized him by that name; she’d been only three or four when he’d moved out. Valerie didn’t ask Gil what he’d talked about with his daughter on the long car journey: perhaps they’d driven the whole way in silence. Or perhaps he’d questioned Robyn about her mother, or ranted on about her, or talked about his work. Sometimes in the evenings<span data-page="page_2"></span> he talked to Valerie for hours about university politics or other historians he envied or resented—or even about the Civil War or the Long Parliament or the idea of the state—without noticing that she wasn’t listening, that she was thinking about new curtains or counting the stitches in her knitting. He might have found fatherhood easier, Valerie thought, if his daughter had been pretty. Moodily, after Robyn had gone to bed, Gil wondered aloud whether she was even his. “Who knows, with the Great Whore of Marylebone putting it about like there’s no tomorrow? The child’s half feral. She doesn’t look anything like me. Is she normal? Do they even send her to school? I think she’s backward. A little bit simple, stunted. No surprise, growing up in that sink of iniquity. God only knows what she’s seen.”</p><p>Valerie was getting to know how he used exaggerated expressions like “sink of iniquity,” whose sense she didn’t know but could guess at, as if he were partly making fun of his own disapproval, while at the same time he furiously meant it. He stayed one step ahead of any fixed position, so that no one could catch him out in it. But Robyn looked more like him than he realized, although she was smooth and bland with childhood and he was hoary and sagging from fifty years’ experience. He had the same pale skin, and the same startled hare’s eyes swimming in and out of focus behind his big black-framed glasses. Sometimes, when Gil laughed, you could see how he might have been a different man if he hadn’t chosen to be this professor with his stooping bulk and crumpled, shapeless suits, his braying, brilliant talk. Without glasses, his face was naked and keen and boyish, with a boy’s shame, as if the nakedness must be smothered like a secret.</p><p>Gil’s widowed mother had owned a small newsagent’s. He’d got himself to university and then onward into success and even fame—he’d been on television often—through his own sheer cleverness and effort. Not that he tried to hide his class origins: on the contrary, he’d honed them into a weapon to use against his colleagues and friends. But he always repeated the same few anecdotes from his childhood, well rounded and glossy from use: the brew-house in the back yard, where the women gossiped and did their washing; the bread-and-drippings suppers; a neighbor cutting his throat in the shared toilet; his mother polishing the front step with Cardinal Red. He didn’t talk about his mother in private, and when Valerie once asked him how she’d died he wouldn’t tell her anything except—gruffly barking it, to frighten her off and mock her fear at the same time—that it was cancer. She guessed that he’d probably been close to his mother, and then grown up to be embarrassed by her, and hated himself for neglecting her, but couldn’t admit to any of this because he was always announcing publicly how much he loathed sentimentality and guilt. Valerie had been attracted to him in the first place because he made fun of everything; nothing was sacred.</p><p>She didn’t really want the child around. But Robyn was part of the price she paid for having been singled out by the professor among the girls in the faculty office at King’s College London, having married him and moved with him to begin a new life in the North. There had been some quarrel or other with King’s; he had enemies there.</p><p>As the week wore on, she grew sick of the sound of her own voice jollying Robyn along. The girl hadn’t even brought any toys with her, to occupy her time. After a while, Valerie noticed that, when no one was looking, she played with two weird little figures, scraps of cloth tied into shapes with wool, one in each hand, doing the voices almost inaudibly. One voice was coaxing and hopeful, the other one reluctant. “Put on your special gloves,” one of them said. “But I don’t like the blue color,” said the other. “These ones have special powers,” the first voice persisted. “Try them out.”</p><p>Valerie asked Robyn if these were her dollies. Shocked out of her fantasy, she hid the scraps behind her back. “Not really,” she said.</p><p>“What are their names?”</p><p>“They don’t have names.”</p><p>“We could get out my sewing machine and make clothes for them.”</p><p>Robyn shook her head, alarmed. “They don’t need clothes.”</p><p>Selena had made them for her, she told Valerie, who worked out that Selena must have been their cleaner. “She doesn’t come anymore,” Robyn added, though not as if she minded particularly. “We sacked her. She stole things.”</p><p>When Valerie tied her into an apron and stood her on a chair to make scones, Robyn’s fingers went burrowing into the flour as if they were independent of her, mashing the butter into lumps in her hot palms. “Like this,” Valerie said, showing her how to lift the flour as she rubbed, for lightness. Playfully, she grabbed at Robyn’s fingers under the surface of the flour, but Robyn snatched them back, dismayed, and wouldn’t try the scones when they were baked. Valerie ended up eating them, although she was trying to watch her weight, sticking to Ryvita and cottage cheese for lunch. She didn’t want to run to fat, like her mother. She<span data-page="page_3"></span> thought Gil refused to visit her mother partly because he worried about how Valerie might look one day, when she wasn’t soft and fresh and blond anymore.</p><p>Robyn had hardly brought enough clothes to last the week—besides the dress with the buttons, there was only a gray skirt that looked like a school uniform, a ribbed nylon jumper, one spare pair of knickers, odd socks, and a full-length nightdress made of red wool flannel, like something out of a storybook. The nightdress smelled of wee and Valerie thought it must be itchy; she took Robyn shopping for sensible pajamas and then they had tea at the cafeteria in British Home Stores, which had been Valerie’s treat when she was Robyn’s age. Robyn didn’t want a meringue but asked if she was allowed to hold her new pajamas, then sat with the cellophane package in her lap and an expression of conscious importance. The pajamas were white, decorated with yellow-and-blue yachts and anchors. “Can I keep them?” she asked tentatively, after a long, dull silence. Valerie had grown tired of chatting away inanely to no one.</p><p>She had been going to suggest that Robyn leave the pajamas behind, for the next time she visited, but she didn’t really care. Every child ought to want something; it was only healthy. And, packed into Robyn’s suitcase along with the rest of her clothes—all freshly washed, apart from the dress, and pressed, even the socks, with Valerie’s steam iron—the pajamas would be like a message, a coded reproach, for that mother in Chelsea. She imagined Marise unpacking them in some room of flowery frivolity she couldn’t clearly visualize and feeling a pang for the insufficiency of her own maternal care. Valerie knew, though, that her parade of competence and righteous indignation was a lie, really. Because the truth was that she couldn’t wait for Robyn to go home. She longed to be free of that dogged, unresponsive little figure following her everywhere around the house.</p><p>Gil was supposed to be driving Robyn back down to London on Wednesday. On Tuesday evening, when he came home early, Valerie knew right away that something was up. He stood behind her while she was preparing meat loaf at the kitchen counter, nuzzling under her ear and stroking her breast with one hand, determinedly jiggling the ice cubes in his Scotch with the other. He always poured himself a generous Scotch as soon as he came in: she’d learned not to comment. “You’re so good to me,” he said pleadingly, his voice muffled in her neck. “I don’t deserve it.”</p><p>“Oh dear, what’s Mr. Naughty’s little game now?” Valerie was long-suffering, faintly amused, swiping onions from her chopping board into a bowl with the side of her knife. “What’s he sniffing after? He wants something.”</p><p>“He knows he’s so selfish. Causes her no end of trouble.”</p><p>These were two of the roles they acted out sometimes: Valerie brusquely competent and in charge, Gil wheedling and needy. There was a truth behind their performances, as well as pretense. Gil groaned apologetically. A problem had come up at work tomorrow, a special guest coming to dinner at High Table, someone he needed to meet because he had influence and the whole game was a bloody conspiracy. He’d never be able to get back from London in time. And Thursday was no good, either—faculty meeting; Friday he was giving a talk in Manchester. They could keep Robyn until Saturday, but the She-Bitch would never let him hear the end of it. He wanted Valerie to take her home tomorrow on the train. Valerie could stay over with her mother in Acton, couldn’t she? Come back the following day?</p><p>Valerie had counted on being free in the morning, getting the house back to normal, having her thoughts to herself again, catching a bus into town perhaps, shopping. She was gasping for her solitude like a lungful of clean air. Biting her lower lip to keep herself from blurting out a protest, she kneaded onions into the minced meat; the recipe came from a magazine—it was seasoned with allspice and tomato ketchup. Certainly she didn’t fancy three extra days with the kid moping around. She thought, with a flush of outrage, that Gil was truly selfish, never taking her needs into consideration. On the other hand, important men had to be selfish in order to get ahead. She understood that—she wouldn’t have wanted a softer man who wasn’t respected. She could squeeze concessions out of him anyway, in return for this favor. Perhaps she’d ring up one of her old girlfriends, meet for coffee in Oxford Street, or even for a gin in a pub, for old times’ sake. She could buy herself something new to wear; she had saved up some money that Gil didn’t know about, out of the housekeeping.</p><p>Theatrically, she sighed. “It’s very inconvenient. I was going to go into Jones’s, to make inquiries about these curtains for the sitting room.”</p><p>He didn’t even correct her and tell her to call it the drawing room.</p><p>“He’s sorry, he’s really sorry. It isn’t fair, he knows it. But it could be a little holiday for you. You could just put Robyn into a cab at the station, give the driver the address, let her mother pay. Why shouldn’t she? She’s got money.”</p><p>Valerie was startled that he could even<span data-page="page_4"></span> think she’d do that. The child could hardly get herself dressed in the mornings; she certainly wasn’t fit to be knocking halfway around London by herself, quarrelling with cabdrivers. And, anyway, if Valerie really was going all the way to London, she might as well have a glimpse of where her stepdaughter lived. She was afraid of Marise, but curious about her, too.</p><p>Outside the front door in Chelsea, Valerie stood holding Robyn’s suitcase in one leather-gloved hand and her own overnight bag in the other. The house was grand and dilapidated, set back from the street in an overgrown garden, with a flight of stone steps rising to a scruffy pillared portico, a broad door painted black. Names in faded, rain-stained ink were drawing-pinned beside a row of bells; they’d already rung twice, and Valerie’s feet were like ice. The afternoon light was thickening gloomily under the evergreens. Robyn stood uncomplaining in her thin coat, although from time to time on their journey Valerie had seen her quake with the cold as if it had probed her, bypassing her conscious mind, like a jolt of electricity. The heating had been faulty on the train. While Valerie read her magazines and Robyn worked dutifully through one page after another in her coloring book, the washed-out, numb winter landscape had borne cruelly in on them from beyond the train window: miles of bleached, tufted dun grasses, purple-black tangled labyrinths of bramble, clumps of dark reeds frozen in a ditch. Valerie had been relieved when they got into the dirty old city at last. She hadn’t taken to the North, though she was trying.</p><p>Staring up at the front door, Robyn had her usual stolidly neutral look, buffered against expectation; she hardly seemed excited by the prospect of seeing her mother again. And, when the door eventually swung open, a young man about Valerie’s age—with long fair hair and a flaunting angel face, dark-stubbled jaw, dead cigarette stuck to the wet of his sagging lip—looked out at them without any recognition. “Oh, hullo?” he said.</p><p>With his peering, dozy eyes, he seemed to have only just got out of bed, or to be about to slop back into it. He was bursting out of his tight clothes: a shrunken T-shirt exposed a long hollow of skinny brown belly and a slick line of dark hairs, leading down inside pink satin hipster trousers. His feet were bare and sprouted with more hair, and he smelled like a zoo animal, of something sour and choking. Realization dawned when he noticed Robyn. “Hullo!” he said, as if it were funny. “You’re the little girl.”</p><p>“Is Mrs. Hope at home?” Valerie asked stiffly.</p><p>He scratched his chest under the T-shirt and his smile slid back to dwell on her, making her conscious of her breasts, although he only quickly flicked his glance across them. “Yeah, somewhere.”</p><p>A woman came clattering downstairs behind him and loomed across his shoulder; she was taller than he was, statuesque, her glittering eyes black with makeup, and diamonds glinting in the piled-up mass of her dark hair, in the middle of the afternoon. Though, of course, the diamonds were paste—it was all a joke, a pantomime sendup. Valerie wasn’t such a fool, she got hold of that. Still, Marise was spectacular in a long, low-cut white dress and white patent-leather boots: she had an exaggerated, coarse beauty, like a film star blurred from being too much seen.</p><p>“Oh, Christ, is it today? Shit! Is that the kid?” Marise wailed, pushing past the young man, her devouring eyes snatching off an impression of Valerie in one scouring instant and dismissing it. “I forgot all about it. It can’t be Wednesday already! Welcome home, honeypot. Give Mummy a million, million kisses. Give Jamie kisses. This is Jamie. Say hello. Isn’t he sweet? Don’t you remember him? He’s in a band.”</p><p>Robyn said hello, gazing at Jamie without much interest and not moving to kiss anyone. Her mother pounced in a cloud of perfume and carried her inside, calling back over her shoulder to Valerie in her husky voice, mistaking her for some kind of paid nanny, or pretending to. “Awfully kind of you. Are those her things? Do you want to drop her bags here in the hall? James can carry them up later. Do you have a cab? Or he can get you one. Oof, what a big, heavy girl you’re getting to be, Robby-bobby. Can you climb up on your own?”</p><p>The hall was dim and high, lit by a feeble unshaded bulb; when determinedly Valerie followed after them, her heels echoed on black and white marble tiles. “Hello, Mrs. H.,” she sang out in her brightest telephone voice. “I’m the new Mrs. H. How nice to meet you.”</p><p>Marise looked down at her from the curve of the staircase, where she was stooping over Robyn, setting her down. “Oh, I thought you might be. I thought he might have chosen someone like you.”</p><p>“I’m hoping you’re going to offer us a cup of tea,” Valerie went on cheerfully. Of course Marise had known that she was bringing Robyn—Gil had telephoned last night to tell her. “Only we’re frozen stiff, the pair of us! The heating on the train wasn’t working.”</p><p>“Do you take milk?” Marise wondered. “Because I don’t know if we have any milk.”<span data-page="page_5"></span></p><p>“So long as it’s hot!”</p><p>She submitted graciously when Jamie offered to take both bags, then was aware of his following her up the stairs, appraising her from behind, and thought that Marise was aware of it, too. A door on the first floor, with a pillared surround and a pediment, stood open. You could see how it had once opened onto the best rooms at the heart of the house: now it had its own Yale lock and was painted purple and orange. The lower panels were dented and splintered as if someone had tried to kick through them. In the enormous room beyond, there was a marble fireplace and a candelabra and floor-length windows hung with tattered yellow brocade drapes; the glass in a vast gilt mirror was so foxed that it didn’t double the perspective but closed it in, like a black fog. Valerie understood that, like the diamonds in Marise’s hair, this wasn’t really decaying aristocratic grandeur but an arty imitation of it. Marise led the way past a glass dome as tall as a man, filled with stuffed, faded hummingbirds and a staring, dappled fairground horse, its flaring nostrils painted crimson; Robyn flinched from the horse as if from an old enemy.</p><p>In the next room, which was smaller, a log fire burned in a blackened grate beside a leather sofa, its cushions cracked and pale with wear. Jamie dropped the bags against a wall. Robyn and Valerie, shivering in their coats, hung over the white ash in the grate as if it might be lifesaving, while Marise hunted for milk in what must have been the kitchen next door, though it sounded cavernous. Jamie crouched to put on more logs, reaching his face toward the flame to reignite his rollie. The milk was off, Marise announced. There was a tin of tomato juice; wouldn’t everyone prefer Bloody Marys? Valerie said that might be just the thing, but knew she must pace herself and not let the drink put her at any disadvantage.</p><p>The Bloody Marys when they came were strong, made with lots of Tabasco and ice and lemon and a stuffed olive on a stick: Marise said they were wonderfully nourishing, she lived on them. She even brought one—made without vodka, or only the tiniest teaspoonful—for Robyn, along with a packet of salted crisps, and she kissed her, pretending to gobble her up. Robyn submitted to the assault. “You’re lucky, I saved those for you specially. I know that little girls are hungry bears. Because Jamie’s a hungry bear, too—he eats everything. I’ll have to hide the food away, won’t I, if we want to keep any of it for you? Are you still my hungry bear, Bobbin?”</p><p>Robyn went unexpectedly then into a bear performance, hunching her shoulders, crossing her eyes, snuffling and panting, scrabbling in the air with her hands curled up like paws, her face a blunt little snout, showing pointed teeth. They must have played this game before; Marise watched her daughter with distaste and pity, austerely handsome as a carved ship’s figurehead. For a moment, Robyn really was a scruffy, dull-furred, small brown bear, dancing joylessly to order. Valerie wouldn’t have guessed that the child had it in her, to enter so completely into a life other than her own. “Nice old bear,” she said encouragingly.</p><p>“That’s quite enough of that, Bobby,” Marise said. “Most unsettling. Now, why don’t you go and play, darling? Take your crisps away before the Jamie-bear gets them.”</p><p>Robyn returned into her ordinary self, faintly pink in the face. “Shall I show Auntie Valerie my bedroom?”</p><p>Marise’s expression ripened scandalously. She stared wide-eyed between Robyn and Valerie. “ ‘Auntie Valerie’! What’s this? Valerie isn’t your real auntie, you know. Didn’t anyone explain to you?”</p><p>“We thought it was the best thing for her to call me, considering,” Valerie said.</p><p>“Well, I’m relieved you didn’t go in for ‘Mummy.’ Or ‘Dearest Mamma,’ or ‘Mom.’ ”</p><p>Flustered, Robyn shot a guilty look at Valerie. “I do know she’s my stepmother, really.”</p><p>“That’s better. Your <em>wicked</em> stepmother, don’t forget.” Marise winked broadly at Valerie. “Now, off you go. She doesn’t want to see your bedroom.”</p><p>They heard her trail through the kitchen, open another door on the far side, close it again behind her. The fire blazed up. Jamie began picking out something on his guitar, while Marise rescued his rollie from the ashtray and fell with it onto the opposite end of the sofa. Valerie guessed that they were smoking pot—that was what the zoo smell was. And she thought that she ought to leave. There was nothing for her here—she had made her point by coming inside. “So, Valerie,” Marise said musingly. “How did you get on with my dear daughter? Funny little snake, isn’t she? I hope Gilbert enjoyed spending every moment with her, after all those protestations of how he’s such a devoted father. Was she a good girl?”</p><p>“Awfully good. We didn’t have a squeak of trouble.”</p><p>“I mean, isn’t she just a piece of Gilbert? Except not clever, of course. Poor little mite, with his looks and my brains.”</p><p>Outside, the last of the afternoon light was being blotted out, and although wind buffeted the loose old windowpanes, no one stirred to draw the curtains or switch on the lamps. Valerie wanted to go, but the<span data-page="page_6"></span> drink was stronger than she was used to, and the heat from the fire seemed to press her down in the sofa. Also, she feared returning through the next room, past the stuffed birds and that horse. She was imagining how her husband might have been impressed and excited once by this careless, shameless, disordered household. If you owned so much, you could afford to trample it underfoot in a grand gesture, turning everything into a game.</p><p>“I do adore clever men,” Marise went on. “I was so in love with Gilbert’s intelligence, absolutely crazy about him at first. I could sit listening to him for hours on end, telling me all about history and ideas and art. Because, you know, I’m just an absolute idiot. I was kicked out of school when I was fourteen—the nuns hated me. Valerie, truly, I can hardly read and write. Whereas I expect you can do typing and shorthand, you clever girl. So I’d just kneel there at Gilbert’s feet, gazing up at him while he talked. You know, just talking, talking, droning on and on. So pleased with himself. Don’t men just love that?”</p><p>“Do they? I wouldn’t know.”</p><p>“But they do, they love it when we’re kneeling at their feet. Jamie thinks that’s hilarious, don’t you, Jamie? Because now I’m worshipping him instead, he thinks. Worshipping his guitar.”</p><p>“My talent,” Jamie chastely suggested. Marise shuffled down in the sofa to poke her white boot at him, prodding at his hands and blocking the strings so that he couldn’t play until he ducked the neck of his guitar out of her way. His exasperated look slid past her teasing and onto Valerie, where it rested. Marise subsided with a sigh.</p><p>“So Gilbert’s sitting there steering along in the little cockpit of his own cleverness, believing himself so shining, such a wonder! And then suddenly one day I couldn’t stand it! I thought, But the whole <em>world</em>, the whole of real life, is spread out underneath him. And he’s up there all alone in his own clever head. Don’t you know what I mean?”</p><p>“I’ve never taken much interest in Gil’s work,” Valerie said primly. “Though I’m aware how highly it’s regarded. I’ve got my own interests.”</p><p>“Oh, have you? Good for you! Because I’ve never really had any interests to speak of. I’ve counted on the men in my life to supply those. Gilbert was certainly interesting. Did you know that he beat me? Yes, really. To a pulp, my dear.”</p><p>What melodrama! Valerie laughed out loud. She didn’t believe it. Or perhaps she did. When Marise, mocking, blew out a veil of smoke, she had a glimpse for a moment of Gil’s malevolent Bitch from Hell, the strong-jawed dark sorceress who might incite a man to violence. Poor Gilbert. And it was true that his rages had been a revelation when they were first married. In the university office, all the women had petted him and were in awe of his mystique: he had seemed thoughtful, forgetful, bumbling, dryly humorous, and high-minded. She stood up, trying to shake off the influence of the Bloody Mary. Her mother would be expecting her, she said. “And I don’t know what your plans are for Robyn’s tea. But I made us cheese sandwiches for the train, so she’s had a decent lunch, at least, and an apple and a Mars bar.”</p><p>Marise was amused. “I don’t have any plans for Robyn’s tea. I’ve never really made those kinds of plans.”</p><p>She stretched out, luxuriating into the extra space on the sofa, putting her boots up. Valerie meant to go looking for Robyn then, to say goodbye, but the sight of chaos in the kitchen brought her up short: dishes piled in an old sink, gas cooker filthy with grease, torn slices of bread and stained tea towels and orange peels lying on the linoleum floor where they’d been dropped. The table was still laid with plates on which some dark meat stew or sauce was congealing. She went to pick up her bag instead. “Give her my love,” she said.</p><p>No one offered to show Valerie out. Heroically, like a girl in a film, she made her way alone through the next-door room, where the pale horse gleamed sinisterly; she jumped when something moved, thinking it was a flutter of stuffed birds, but it was only her own reflection in the foxed mirror. On the stairs, she remembered that she shouldn’t have called it “tea.” Gil was always reminding her to say “dinner” or “supper.” And once she was outside, on the path in the wind, Valerie looked back, searching along the first-floor windows of the house for any sign of the child looking out. But it was impossible to see—the glass was reflecting a last smoldering streak of sunset, dark as a livid coal smashed open.</p><p>That night it snowed. Valerie woke up in the morning in her old bedroom at her mother’s and knew it before she even looked outside: a purer, weightless light bloomed on the wallpaper, and the crowded muddle of gloomy furniture inherited from her grandmother seemed washed clean and self-explanatory. She opened the curtains and lay looking out at the snow falling, exhilarated as if she were back in her childhood. Her mother had the wireless on downstairs.</p><p>“Trains aren’t running,” she said gloatingly when Valerie came<span data-page="page_7"></span> down. She was sitting smoking at the table in her housecoat, in the heat of the gas fire. “So I suppose you’ll have to stay over another night.”</p><p>“Oh, I don’t know, Mum. I’ve got things to do at home.”</p><p>The snow made her restless; she didn’t want to be shut up with her mother all day with nothing to talk about. She found a pair of zip-up sheepskin boots at the back of a cupboard and ventured out to the phone box. Snow was blowing across the narrow street in wafting veils, and the quiet was like a sudden deafness; breaking into the crusted surface, her boots creaked. No one had come out to shovel yet, so nothing was spoiled. Every horizontal ledge and edge and rim was delicately capped; the phone box was smothered in snow, the light blue-gray inside it. She called Gil and pushed her money in, told him she was going to go to the station, find out what was happening. He said that there was snow in the North, too. He wouldn’t go to the faculty meeting today; he’d work on his book at home. “Please try to get here any way you can,” he said in a low, urgent voice. “He misses you.”</p><p>“I have to go,” she said. “There’s quite a queue outside.”</p><p>But there wasn’t; there was only silence and the shifting vacancy. The footprints she’d made on her way there were filling up already.</p><p>“I don’t know why you’re so eager to get back to him,” her mother grumbled. But Valerie wasn’t really thinking about Gil: it was the strangeness of the snow she liked, and the disruption it caused. It took her almost an hour and a half to get to King’s Cross—the Underground was working, but it was slow. When she surfaced, it had stopped snowing, at least for the moment, but there still weren’t any trains. A porter said she should try again later that afternoon; it was his guess that if the weather held they might be able to reopen some of the major routes. Valerie didn’t want to linger in King’s Cross. She put her bag in left luggage, then thought of going shopping—they’d surely have cleared Oxford Street. But she took the Piccadilly line instead, as far as South Ken. By the time she arrived at the Chelsea house, it was gone two o’clock.</p><p>The house was almost unrecognizable at first, transformed in the snow. It seemed exposed and taller and more formidable, more mysteriously separated from its neighbors, standing apart in dense shrubbery, which was half obliterated under its burden of white. Valerie didn’t even know why she’d come back. Perhaps she’d had some idea that if she saw Marise today she’d be able to behave with more sophistication, say what she really thought. As she arrived at the corner, she glanced up at the side windows on the first floor. And there was Robyn looking out—in the wrong direction at first, so that she didn’t see Valerie. She seemed to be crouched on the windowsill, slumped against the glass. It was unmistakably her, because although it was past lunchtime she was still dressed in the new white pajamas.</p><p>Valerie stopped short in her tramping. Her boots were wet through. Had she seriously entertained the idea of ringing the doorbell and being invited inside again, without any reasonable pretext, into that place where she most definitely wasn’t wanted? The next moment it was too late: Robyn had seen her. The child’s whole body responded in a violent spasm of astonishment, almost as if she’d been looking out for Valerie, yet not actually expecting her to appear. In the whole week of her visit, she hadn’t reacted so forcefully to anything. She leaped up on the windowsill, waving frantically, so that she was pressed full length against the glass. Remembering how those windows had rattled the night before, Valerie signalled to her to get down, motioning with her gloved hand and mouthing. Robyn couldn’t hear her but gazed in an intensity of effort at comprehension. Valerie signalled again: Get down, be careful. Robyn shrugged, then gestured eagerly down to the front door, miming opening something. Valerie saw that she didn’t have a choice. Nodding and pointing, she agreed that she was on her way around to the front. No one had trodden yet in the snow along the path, but she was lucky, the front entrance had been left open—deliberately, perhaps, because, as she stepped into the hall, a man called down, low-voiced and urgent, from the top landing, “John, is that you?”</p><p>Apologizing into the dimness for not being John, Valerie hurried upstairs to where Robyn was fumbling with the latches on the other side of the purple-and-orange door. Then she heard Jamie. “Hullo! Now what are you up to? Is someone out there?”</p><p>When the door swung back, Valerie saw that—alarmingly—Jamie was in his underpants. He was bemused rather than hostile. “What are you doing here?”</p><p>She invented hastily, hot-faced, avoiding looking at his near-nakedness. “Robyn forgot something. I came to give it to her.”</p><p>“I want to show her my toys,” Robyn said.</p><p>He hesitated. “Her mother’s lying down—she’s got a headache. But you might as well come in. There’s no one else for her to play with.”</p><p>Robyn pulled Valerie by the hand through a door<span data-page="page_8"></span> that led straight into the kitchen; someone had cleared up the plates of stew, but without scraping them—they were stacked beside the sink. The only sign of breakfast was an open packet of cornflakes on the table, and a bowl and spoon. In Robyn’s bedroom, across a short passageway, there really were nice toys, better than anything Valerie had ever possessed: a doll’s house, a doll’s cradle with white muslin drapes, a wooden Noah’s Ark whose roof lifted off. The room was cold and cheerless, though, and there were no sheets on the bare mattress, only a dirty yellow nylon sleeping bag. No one had unpacked Robyn’s suitcase—everything was still folded inside; she must have opened it herself to get out her pajamas. There was a chest with its drawers hanging open, and most of Robyn’s clothes seemed to be overflowing from supermarket carrier bags piled against the walls.</p><p>“I knew you’d come back,” Robyn said earnestly, not letting go of Valerie’s hand.</p><p>Valerie opened her mouth to explain that it was only because she’d missed her train in all this weather, then she changed her mind. “We weren’t expecting snow, were we?” she said brightly.</p><p>“Have you come to get me? Are you taking me to your house again?”</p><p>She explained that she’d only come to say goodbye.</p><p>“No, please don’t say goodbye! Auntie Valerie, don’t go.”</p><p>“I’m sure you’ll be coming to stay with us again soon.”</p><p>The child flung herself convulsively at Valerie, punishing her passionately, butting with her head. “Not soon! Now! I want to come now!”</p><p>Valerie liked Robyn better with her face screwed into an ugly fury, kicking out with her feet, the placid brushstrokes of her brows distorted to exclamation marks. Holding her off by her shoulders, she felt the aftertremor of the child’s violence.</p><p>“Do you really want to come home with me?”</p><p>“Really, really,” Robyn pleaded.</p><p>“But what about your mummy?”</p><p>“She won’t mind! We can get out without her noticing.”</p><p>“Oh, I think we’ll need to talk to her. But let’s pack first. And you have to get dressed—if you’re really sure, that is. We need to go back to the station to see if the trains are running.” Valerie looked around with a new purposefulness, assessing quickly. “Where’s your coat? Do you need the bathroom?”</p><p>Robyn sat abruptly on the floor to take off her pajamas, and Valerie tipped out the contents of the suitcase, began repacking it with a few things that looked useful—underwear and wool jumpers and shoes. The toothbrush was still in its sponge bag. Then they heard voices, and a chair knocked over in the kitchen, and, before Valerie could prepare what she ought to say, Marise came stalking into the bedroom, with Jamie behind her. At least he’d put on trousers. “How remarkable!” Marise exclaimed. “What do you think you’re doing, Valerie? Are you kidnapping my child?” Wrapped in a gold silk kimono embroidered with dragons, the sooty remnants of yesterday’s makeup under her eyes, she looked as formidable as a tragic character in a play.</p><p>“Don’t be ridiculous,” Valerie coolly said. “I’m not kidnapping her. I was about to come and find you, to ask whether she could come back with us for another week or so. And I’ve got a perfect right, anyway. She says that she’d prefer to be at her father’s.”</p><p>“I’m calling the police.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t if I were you. You haven’t got a leg to stand on. It’s criminal neglect. Look at this room! There aren’t even sheets on her bed.”</p><p>“She prefers a sleeping bag. Ask her!”</p><p>Frozen in the act of undressing, Robyn turned her face, blank with dismay, back and forth between the two women.</p><p>“And I’d like to know what she’s eaten since she came home. There isn’t any milk in the house, is there? It’s two-thirty in the afternoon and all the child has had since lunchtime yesterday is dry cornflakes.”</p><p>“You know nothing about motherhood, nothing!” Marise shrieked. “Robyn won’t touch milk—she hates it. She’s been fussy from the day she was born. And she’s a spy, she’s a little spy! Telling tales about me. How dare she? She’s a vicious, ungrateful little snake and you’ve encouraged her in it. I knew this would happen. I should never have let Gilbert take her in the first place. I knew he’d only be stirring her up against me. Where’s he been all these years, with his so-called feelings for his daughter, I’d like to know? Jamie, get this cheap kidnapping whore out of here, won’t you? No, I like whores. She’s much worse, she’s a <em>typist</em>.”</p><p>Valerie said that she didn’t need Jamie to take her anywhere, and that, if they were slinging names about, she knew what Marise was. Minutes later, she was standing outside in the garden, stopping to catch her breath beside the gate, where the dustbins were set back from the path behind a screen of pines. She was smitten with the cold and trembling, penitent and ashamed. She shouldn’t have interfered; she was out of her depth. It was true that she didn’t know anything about motherhood. Hadn’t she encouraged Robyn, just as Marise said, trying to make the child like her? And without genuinely liking in return. Now she had abandoned her to her mother’s revenge, which might be awful. Then the<span data-page="page_final"></span> front door opened and Jamie was coming down the path, with a curious gloating look on his face: under his arms, against his bare chest, he was carrying the dirty yellow sleeping bag that had been on Robyn’s bed. Hustling Valerie back among the pines, out of sight of the windows, he dumped the bag at her feet. “Off you go,” he said significantly, as if he and Valerie were caught up in some game together. “Her mother’s lying down again. Take it and get out of here.”</p><p>It took her a moment or two to understand. In the meantime, he’d returned inside the house and closed the door. There was a mewing from the bag, she fumbled to unroll it, and Robyn struggled out from inside and wrapped her arms, with a fierce sigh of submission, around Valerie’s knees. But she was in her white pajamas, barefoot, in the snow! How could they make their way through the streets with Robyn dressed like that? A window opened above them and Jamie lobbed out something, which landed with a soft thud on the path: one of the carrier bags from Robyn’s room, packed with a miscellany of clothes—and he’d thought to add the pair of plimsolls. Then he closed the window and disappeared. There was no coat in the bag, but never mind. In panicking haste, Valerie helped Robyn put on layers of clothes over her pajamas: socks, cord trousers, plimsolls, jumper.</p><p>“I thought he was going to eat me,” Robyn said.</p><p>“Don’t be silly,” Valerie said firmly. She kicked the sleeping bag away out of sight, among the hedge roots.</p><p>“Are we escaping?”</p><p>“We’re having an adventure.”</p><p>And they set out, ducking into the street, hurrying along beside the hedge. By a lucky chance, as soon as they got to the main road there was a taxi nosing through the slush. “How much to King’s Cross?” Valerie asked. She had all the money she’d been saving up to spend on a new dress. She’d have to buy Robyn a train ticket, too. Then she asked the taxi to stop at a post office, where she went inside to send a telegram. She couldn’t telephone Gil; she knew he’d forbid her to bring the child back again. But she couldn’t arrive with Robyn without warning him. “Returning with daughter,” she wrote out on the form. “No fit home for her.” She counted out the shillings from her purse.</p><p>Back in the taxi, making conversation, she asked Robyn where her dollies were. Robyn was stricken—she’d left them behind, under her pillow. It was dusk in the streets already: as they drove on, the colored lights from the shops wheeled slowly across their faces, revealing them as strangers to each other. Valerie was thinking that she might need to summon all this effort of ingenuity one day for some escape of her own, dimly imagined, and that taking on the child made her less free. Robyn sat forward on the seat, tensed with her loss. Awkwardly, Valerie put an arm around her, to reassure her. She said not to worry, they would make new dolls, and better ones. Just for the moment, though, the child was inconsolable. ♦</p>	Tessa Hadley	October 16, 2017 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/16/funny-little-snake	Children	Daughters	Families	Divorce	Stepmothers		Valerie	Third	Children
Meet the President!	<p>“What <span data-page="page_1"></span>you got there, then?”</p><p>The boy didn’t hear the question. He stood at the end of a ruined pier, believing himself quite alone. But now he registered the presence at his back, and turned.</p><p>“What you got there?”</p><p>A very old person, a woman, stood before him, gripping the narrow shoulder of a girl child. Both of them local, typically stunted, dim: they stared up at him stupidly. The boy turned again to the sea. All week long he had been hoping for a clear day to try out the new technology—not new to the world, but new to the boy—and now at last here was a break in the rain. Gray sky met gray sea. Not ideal, but sufficient. Ideally he would be standing on a cairn in Scotland or some other tropical spot, experiencing backlit clarity. Ideally he would be—</p><p>“Is it one of them what you see through?”</p><p>A hand, lousy with blue veins, reached out for the light encircling the boy’s head, as if it were a substantial thing, to be grasped like the handle of a mug.</p><p>“Ooh, look at the green, Aggie. That shows you it’s on.”</p><p>The boy was ready to play. He touched the node on his finger to the node at his temple, raising the volume.</p><p>“Course, he’d have to be somebody, Aggs, cos they don’t give ’em to nobody”—the boy felt the shocking touch of a hand on his own flesh. “Are you somebody, then?”</p><p>She had shuffled around until she stood square in front of him, unavoidable. Hair as white as paper. A long, shapeless black dress, made of some kind of cloth, and what appeared to be a pair of actual glasses. Forty-nine years old, type O, a likelihood of ovarian cancer, some ancient debt infraction—nothing more. A blank, more or less. Same went for the girl: never left the country, eighty-five-per-cent chance of macular degeneration, an uncle on the database, long ago located, eliminated. She would be nine in two days. Melinda Durham and Agatha Hanwell. They shared no more DNA than strangers.</p><p>“Can you see us?” The old woman let go of her charge and waved her hands wildly. The tips of her fingers barely reached the top of the boy’s head. “Are we in it? What are we?”</p><p>The boy, unused to proximity, took a single step forward. Farther he could not go. Beyond was the ocean; above, a mess of weather, clouds closing in on blue wherever blue tried to assert itself. A dozen or so craft darted up and down, diving low like seabirds after a fish, and no bigger than seabirds, skimming the dirty foam, then returning to the heavens, directed by unseen hands. On his first day here the boy had trailed his father on an inspection tour to meet those hands: intent young men at their monitors, over whose shoulders the boy’s father leaned, as he sometimes leaned over the boy to insure he ate breakfast.</p><p>“What d’you call one of them there?”</p><p>The boy tucked his shirt in all round: “AG 12.”</p><p>The old woman snorted as a mark of satisfaction, but did not leave.</p><p>He tried looking the females directly in their dull brown eyes. It was what his mother would have done, a kindly woman with a great mass of waist-length flame-colored hair, famed for her patience with locals. But his mother was long dead, he had never known her, he was losing what little light the day afforded. He blinked twice, said, “Hand to hand.” Then, having a change of heart: “Weaponry.” He looked down at his torso, to which he now attached a quantity of guns.</p><p>“You carry on, lad,” the old woman said. “We won’t get in your way. He can see it all, duck,” she told the girl, who paid her no mind. “Got something in his hands—or thinks he does.”</p><p>She took a packet of tobacco from a deep pocket in the front of her garment and began to roll a cigarette, using the girl as a shield from the wind.</p><p>“Them clouds, dark as bulls. Racing, racing. They always win.” To illustrate, she tried turning Aggie’s eyes to the sky, lifting the child’s chin with a finger, but the girl would only gawk stubbornly at the woman’s elbow. “They’ll dump on us before we even get there. If you didn’t have to, I wouldn’t go, Aggie, no chance, not in this. It’s for you I do it. I’ve been wet and wet and wet. All my life. And I bet he’s looking at blazing suns and people in their what-have-yous and all-togethers! Int yer? Course you are! And who’d blame you?” She laughed so loud the boy heard her. And then the child—who did not laugh, whose pale face, with its triangle chin and enormous, fair-lashed eyes, seemed capable only of astonishment—pulled at his actual leg, forcing him to mute for a moment and listen to her question.</p><p>“Well, I’m Bill Peek,” he replied, and felt very silly, like somebody in an old movie.</p><p>“Bill Peek!” the old woman cried. “Oh, but we’ve had Peeks in Anglia a long time. You’ll find a Peek or two or three down in Sutton Hoo. Bill Peek! You from round here, Bill Peek?”</p><p>His grandparents? Very possibly. Local and English—or his great-grandparents. His hair and eyes and skin and name suggested it.<span data-page="page_2"></span> But it was not a topic likely to engage his father, and the boy himself had never felt any need or desire to pursue it. He was simply global, accompanying his father on his inspections, though usually to livelier spots than this. What a sodden dump it was! Just as everyone had warned him it would be. The only people left in England were the ones who couldn’t leave.</p><p>“From round here, are you? Or maybe a Norfolk one? He looks like a Norfolk one, Aggs, wouldn’t you say?”</p><p>Bill Peek raised his eyes to the encampment on the hill, pretending to follow with great interest those dozen circling, diving craft, as if he, uniquely, as the child of personnel, had nothing to fear from them. But the woman was occupied with her fag and the girl only sang “Bill Peek, Bill Peek, Bill Peek” to herself, and smiled sadly at her own turned-in feet. They were too local even to understand the implied threat. He jumped off the pier onto the deserted beach. It was low tide—it seemed you could walk to Holland. He focussed upon the thousands of tiny spirals on the sand, like miniature turds stretching out to the horizon.</p><p>Felixstowe, England. A Norman village; later, briefly, a resort, made popular by the German royal family; much fishing, once upon a time. A hundred years earlier, almost to the very month, a quaint flood had killed only forty-eight people. Over the years, the place had been serially flooded, mostly abandoned. Now the sad little town had retreated three miles inland and up a hill. Pop.: 850. The boy blinked twice more; he did not care much for history. He narrowed his attention to a single turd. <em>Arenicola marina</em>. Sandworms. Lugworms. These were its coiled castings. Castings? But here he found his interest fading once again. He touched his temple and said, “Blood Head 4.” Then: “Washington.” It was his first time at this level. Another world began to construct itself around Bill Peek, a shining city on a hill.</p><p>“Poor little thing,” Melinda Durham said. She sat on the pier, legs dangling, and pulled the girl into her lap. “Demented with grief she is. We’re going to a laying out. Aggie’s sister is laid out today. Her last and only relation. Course, the cold truth is, Aggie’s sister weren’t much better than trash, and a laying out’s a sight too good for her—she’d be better off laid out on this beach here and left for the gulls. But I ain’t going for <em>her</em>. I do it for Aggie. Aggie knows why. Aggie’s been a great help to me what with one thing and another.”</p><p>While he waited, as incidental music played, the boy idly checked a message from his father: at what time could he be expected back at the encampment? <em>At what time could he be expected</em>. This was a pleasing development, being an inquiry rather than an order. He would be fifteen in May, almost a man! A man who could let another man know when he could be expected, and let him know in his own sweet time, when he had the inclination. He performed some rudimentary stretches and bounced up and down on the balls of his feet.</p><p>“Maud, that was her name. And she was born under the same steeple she’ll be buried under. Twelve years old. But so whorish—” Melinda covered Aggie’s ears, and the girl leaned into the gesture, having mistaken it for affection. “So whorish she looked like a crone. If you lived round here, Bill Peek, you’d’ve <em>known</em> Maud, if you understand me correctly. You would’ve known Maud right up to the Biblical and beyond. Terrible. But Aggie’s cut from quite different sod, thank goodness!” Aggie was released and patted on the head. “And she’s no one left, so here I am, muggins here, taking her to a laying out when I’ve a million other stones to be lifted off the pile.”</p><p>The boy placed a number of grenades about his person. In each chapter of the Pathways Global Institute (in Paris, New York, Shanghai, Nairobi, Jerusalem, Tokyo), the boy had enjoyed debating with friends the question of whether it was better to augment around the “facts on the ground,” incorporating whatever was at hand (“flagging,” it was called, the pleasure being the unpredictability), or to choose spots where there were barely any facts to work around. The boy was of the latter sensibility. He wanted to augment in clean, blank places, where he was free to fully extend, unhindered. He looked down the beach as the oil streaks in the sand were overlaid now with a gleaming pavement, lined on either side by the National Guard, saluting him. It was three miles to the White House. He picked out a large pair of breasts to wear, for reasons of his own, and a long, scaled tail, for purposes of strangulation.</p><p>“Oh, fuck a duck—you wouldn’t do me an awful favor and keep an eye on Aggie just a minute, would you?—I’ve left my rosary! I can’t go to no laying out without it. It’s more than my soul’s worth. Oh, Aggie, how did you ever let me leave without it? She’s a good girl, but she’s thoughtless sometimes—her sister were thoughtless, too. Bill Peek, you will keep an eye on her, won’t you?<span data-page="page_3"></span> I won’t be a moment. We’re shacked up just on that hill by the old Martello tower. Eight minutes I’ll be. No more. Would you do that for me, Bill Peek?”</p><p>Bill Peek nodded his head, once rightward, twice leftward. Knives shot out of his wrists and splayed beautifully like the fronds of a fern.</p><p>It was perhaps twenty minutes later, as he approached the pile of rubble—pounded by enemy craft—that had once been the Monument, that young Bill Peek felt again a presence at his back and turned and found Aggie Hanwell with her fist in her mouth, tears streaming, jaw working up and down in an agonized fashion. He couldn’t hear her over the explosions. Reluctantly, he paused.</p><p>“She ain’t come back.”</p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p>“She went but she ain’t come back!”</p><p>“Who?” he asked, but then scrolled back until he found it. “M. Durham?”</p><p>The girl gave him that same astonished look.</p><p>“My Melly,” she said. “She promised to take me but she went and she ain’t come back!”</p><p>The boy swiftly located M. Durham—as much an expedience as an act of charity—and experienced the novelty of sharing the information with the girl, in the only way she appeared able to receive it. “She’s two miles away,” he said, with his own mouth. “Heading north.”</p><p>Aggie Hanwell sat down on her bum in the wet sand. She rolled something in her hand. The boy looked at it and learned that it was a periwinkle—a snail of the sea! He recoiled, disliking those things which crawled and slithered upon the earth. But this one proved broken, with only a pearlescent nothing inside it.</p><p>“So it was all a lie,” Aggie said, throwing her head back dramatically to consider the sky. “Plus one of them’s got my number. I’ve done nothing wrong but still Melly’s gone and left me and one of them thing’s been following me, since the pier—even before that.”</p><p>“If you’ve done nothing wrong,” Bill Peek said, solemnly parroting his father, “you’ve nothing to worry about. It’s a precise business.” He had been raised to despair of the type of people who spread misinformation about the Program. Yet along with his new maturity had come fresh insight into the complexities of his father’s world. For didn’t those with bad intent on occasion happen to stand beside the good, the innocent, or the underaged? And in those circumstances could precision be entirely guaranteed? “Anyway, they don’t track children. Don’t you understand anything?”</p><p>Hearing this, the girl laughed—a bitter and cynical cackle, at odds with her pale little face—and Bill Peek made the mistake of being, for a moment, rather impressed. But she was only imitating her elders, as he was imitating his.</p><p>“Go home,” he said.</p><p>Instead she set about burrowing her feet into the wet sand.</p><p>“Everyone’s got a good angel and a bad angel,” she explained. “And if it’s a bad angel that picks you out”—she pointed to a craft swooping low—“there’s no escaping it. You’re done for.”</p><p>He listened in wonderment. Of course he’d always known there were people who thought in this way—there was a module you did on them in sixth grade—but he had never met anyone who really harbored what his anthro-soc teacher, Mr. Lin, called “animist beliefs.”</p><p>The girl sighed, scooped up more handfuls of sand, and added them to the two mounds she had made on top of her feet, patting them down, encasing herself up to the ankles. Meanwhile all around her Bill Peek’s scene of fabulous chaos was frozen—a Minotaur sat in the lap of stony Abe Lincoln and a dozen carefully planted I.E.D.s awaited detonation. He was impatient to return.</p><p>“Must advance,” he said, pointing down the long stretch of beach, but she held up her hands, she wanted pulling up. He pulled. Standing, she clung to him, hugging his knees. He felt her face damp against his leg.</p><p>“Oh, it’s awful bad luck to miss a laying out! Melly’s the one knew where to go. She’s got the whole town up here,” she said, tapping her temple, making the boy smile. “Memoried. No one knows town like Melly. She’ll say, ‘This used to be here, but they knocked it down,’ or, ‘There was a pub here with a mark on the wall where the water rose.’ She’s memoried every corner. She’s my friend.”</p><p>“Some friend!” the boy remarked. He succeeded in unpeeling the girl from his body, and strode on down the beach, firefighting a gang of Russian commandoes as they parachuted into view. Alongside him a scurrying shape ran; sometimes a dog, sometimes a droid, sometimes a huddle of rats. Her voice rose out of it.</p><p>“Can I see?”</p><p>Bill Peek disembowelled a fawn to his left. “Do you have an Augmentor?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Do you have a complementary system?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>He knew he was being cruel—but she was ruining his concentration. He stopped running and split the visuals, the better to stare her down.</p><p>“Any system?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Therefore no. No, you can’t.”</p><p>Her nose was pink, a drop of moisture hung from it. She had an innocence that practically begged to be corrupted. Bill Peek could think of more than a few Pathways boys of his acquaintance who wouldn’t hesitate to take her under the next boardwalk and put a finger inside her. And the rest. As the son of personnel, however, Bill Peek<span data-page="page_4"></span> was held to a different standard.</p><p>“Jimmy Kane had one—he was a fella of Maud’s, her main fella. He flew in and then he flew out—you never knew when he’d be flying in again. He was a captain in the Army. He had an old one of them . . . but said it still worked. He said it made her nicer to look at when they were doing it. He was from nowhere, too.”</p><p>“Nowhere?”</p><p>“Like you.”</p><p>Not for the first time the boy was struck by the great human mysteries of this world. He was almost fifteen, almost a man, and the great human mysteries of this world were striking him with satisfying regularity, as was correct for his stage of development. (From the Pathways Global Institute prospectus: “As our students reach tenth grade they begin to gain insight into the great human mysteries of this world, and a special sympathy for locals, the poor, ideologues, and all those who have chosen to limit their own human capital in ways that it can be difficult at times for us to comprehend.”) From the age of six months, when he was first enrolled in the school, he had hit every mark that Pathways expected of its pupils—walking, talking, divesting, monetizing, programming, augmenting—and so it was all the more shocking to find himself face-to-face with an almost nine-year-old so absolutely blind, so lost, so developmentally debased.</p><p>“<em>This</em>”—he indicated Felixstowe, from the beach with its turd castings and broken piers, to the empty-shell buildings and useless flood walls, up to the hill where his father hoped to expect him—“is nowhere. If you can’t move, you’re no one from nowhere. ‘Capital must flow.’ ” (This last was the motto of his school, though she needn’t know that.) “Now, if you’re asking me where I was born, the event of my birth occurred in Bangkok, but wherever I was born I would remain a member of the Incipio Security Group, which employs my father—and within which I have the highest clearance.” He was surprised by the extent of the pleasure this final, outright lie gave him. It was like telling a story, but in a completely new way—a story that could not be verified or checked, and which only total innocence would accept. Only someone with no access of any kind. Never before had he met someone like this, who could move only in tiny local spirals, a turd on a beach.</p><p>Moved, the boy bent down suddenly and touched the girl gently on her face. As he did so he had a hunch that he probably looked like the first prophet of some monotheistic religion, bestowing his blessing on a recent convert, and, upon re-watching the moment and finding this was so, he sent it out, both to Mr. Lin and to his fellow Pathways boys, for peer review. It would surely count toward completion of Module 19, which emphasized empathy for the dispossessed.</p><p>“Where is it you want to go, my child?”</p><p>She lit up with gratitude, her little hand gripped his, the last of her tears rolling into her mouth and down her neck. “St. Jude’s!” she cried. She kept talking as he replayed the moment to himself and added a small note of explanatory context for Mr. Lin, before he refocussed on her stream of prattle: “And I’ll say goodbye to her. And I’ll kiss her on her face and nose. Whatever they said about her she was my own sister and I loved her and she’s going to a better place—I don’t care if she’s stone cold in that church, I’ll hold her!”</p><p>“Not a church,” the boy corrected. “14 Ware Street, built 1950, originally domestic property, situated on a floodplain, condemned for safety. Site of ‘St. Jude’s’—local, outlier congregation. Has no official status.”</p><p>“St. Jude’s is where she’ll be laid out,” she said and squeezed his hand. “And I’ll kiss her no matter how cold she is.”</p><p>The boy shook his head and sighed.</p><p>“We’re going in the same direction. Just follow me. No speaking.” He put his finger to his lips, and she tucked her chin into her neck meekly, seeming to understand. Re-starting, he flagged her effectively, transforming little Aggie Hanwell into his sidekick, his familiar, a sleek reddish fox. He was impressed by the perfect visual reconstruction of the original animal, apparently once common in this part of the world. Renamed Mystus, she provided cover for his left flank and mutely admired Bill Peek as he took the traitor Vice-President hostage and dragged him down the Mall with a knife to his neck.</p><p>After a spell they came to the end of the beach. Here the sand shaded into pebbles and then a rocky cove, and barnacles held on furiously where so much else had been washed away. Above their heads, the craft were finishing their sallies and had clustered like bees, moving as one back to the landing bay at the encampment. Bill Peek and his familiar were also nearing the end of their journey, moments away from kicking in the door to the Oval Office, where—if all went well—they would meet the President and be thanked for their efforts. But at the threshold, unaccountably, Bill Peek’s mind began to wander. Despite the many friends around the world watching (there was a certain amount of kudos granted to<span data-page="page_5"></span> any boy who successfully met the President in good, if not record, time, on his first run-through), he found himself pausing to stroke Mystus and worry about whether his father would revoke his AG after this trip. It had been a bribe and a sop in the first place—it was unregistered. Bill had wanted to stay on at the Tokyo campus for the whole summer, and then move to Norway, before tsunami season, for a pleasant fall. His father had wanted him by his side, here, in the damp, unlit graylands. An AG 12 was the compromise. But these later models were security risks, easily hacked, and the children of personnel were not meant to carry hackable devices. That’s how much my father loves me, Bill Peek thought hopefully, that’s how much he wants me around.</p><p>Previously the boy had believed that the greatest testament to love was the guarantee—which he had had all his life—of total personal security. He could count on one hand the amount of times he’d met a local; radicals were entirely unknown to him; he had never travelled by any mode of transport that held more than four people. But now, almost adult, he had a new thought, saw the matter from a fresh perspective, which he hoped would impress Mr. Lin with its age-appropriate intersectionality. He rested against the Oval Office door and sent his thought to the whole Pathways family: “Daring to risk personal security can be a sign of love, too.” Feeling inspired, he split the visual in order to pause and once more appreciate the human mysteries of this world slash how far he’d come.</p><p>He found that he was resting on a slimy rock, his fingers tangled in the unclean hair follicles of Agatha Hanwell. She saw him looking at her. She said, “Are we there yet?” The full weight of her innocence emboldened him. They were five minutes from Ware Street. Wasn’t that all the time he needed? No matter what lay beyond that door, it would be dispatched by Bill Peek, brutally, beautifully; he would step forward, into his destiny. He would meet the President! He would shake the President’s hand.</p><p>“Follow me.”</p><p>She was quick on the rocks, perhaps even a little quicker than he, moving on all fours like an animal. They took a right, a left, and Bill Peek slit many throats. The blood ran down the walls of the Oval Office and stained the Presidential seal and at the open windows a crowd of cheering, anonymous well-wishers pressed in. At which point Mystus strayed from him and rubbed herself along their bodies, and was stroked and petted in turn.</p><p>“So many people come to see your Maud. Does the soul good.”</p><p>“How are you, Aggie, love? Bearing up?”</p><p>“They took her from the sky. Boom! ‘Public depravity.’ I mean, I ask you!”</p><p>“Come here, Aggs, give us a hug.”</p><p>“Who’s that with her?”</p><p>“Look, that’s the little sis. Saw it all. Poor little thing.”</p><p>“She’s in the back room, child. You go straight through. You’ve more right than anybody.”</p><p>All Bill Peek knew is that many bodies were lying on the ground and a space was being made for him to approach. He stepped forward like a king. The President saluted him. The two men shook hands. But the light was failing, and then failed again; the celebrations were lost in infuriating darkness. . . . The boy touched his temple, hot with rage: a low-ceilinged parlor came into view, with its filthy window, further shaded by a ragged net curtain, the whole musty hovel lit by candles. He couldn’t even extend an arm—there were people everywhere, local, offensive to the nose, to all other senses. He tried to locate Agatha Hanwell, but her precise coördinates were of no use here; she was packed deep into this crowd—he could no more get to her than to the moon. A fat man put a hand on his shoulder and asked, “You in the right place, boy?” A distressing female with few teeth said, “Leave him be.” Bill Peek felt himself being pushed forward, deeper into the darkness. A song was being sung, by human voices, and though each individual sang softly, when placed side by side like this, like rows of wheat in the wind, they formed a weird unity, heavy and light at the same time. “<em>Because I do not hope to turn again</em> . . . <em>Because I do not hope</em> . . .” In one voice, like a great beast moaning. A single craft carrying the right hardware could take out the lot of them, but they seemed to have no fear of that. Swaying, singing.</p><p>Bill Peek touched his sweaty temple and tried to focus on a long message from his father—something about a successful inspection and Mexico in the morning—but he was being pushed by many hands, ever forward, until he reached the back wall where a long box, made of the kind of wood you saw washed up on the beach, sat on a simple table, with candles all around it. The singing grew ever louder. Still, as he passed through their number, it seemed that no man or woman among them sang above a whisper. Then, cutting across it all like a stick through the sand, a child’s voice wailed, an acute, high-pitched sound, such as a small<span data-page="page_final"></span> animal makes when, out of sheer boredom, you break its leg. Onward they pushed him; he saw it all perfectly clearly in the candlelight—the people in black, weeping, and Aggie on her knees by the table, and inside the driftwood box the lifeless body of a real girl, the first object of its kind that young Bill Peek had ever seen. Her hair was red and set in large, infantile curls, her skin very white, and her eyes wide open and green. A slight smile revealed the gaps in her teeth, and suggested secret knowledge, the kind of smile he had seen before on the successful sons of powerful men with full clearance—the boys who never lose. Yet none of it struck him quite as much as the sensation that there was someone or something else in that grim room, both unseen and present, and coming for him as much as for anybody. ♦</p>	Zadie Smith	August 12 & 19, 2013 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/08/12/meet-the-president	Beaches	Books	Children	Crafts	England	Holograms	Bill Peek	Third	Children
Mother’s Day	<p>The trees along Pine Street that every spring bloomed purple flowers had bloomed purple flowers. So what? What was the big deal? It happened every spring. Pammy kept saying, “Look at the flowers, Ma. Ain’t them flowers amazing?” The kids were trying to kiss up. Paulie had flown in, and Pammy had taken her to Mother’s Day lunch and now was holding her hand. Holding her hand! Right on Pine. The girl who once slapped her own mother for attempting to adjust her collar.</p><p>Pammy said, “Ma, these flowers, wow, they really blow me away.”</p><p>Just like Pammy to take her mother to lunch in a sweatshirt with a crossed-out picture of a machine gun on it. What about a nice dress? Or pants suit? At least this time Pammy and Paulie hadn’t been on her about the smoking. Even back when Pammy was taking harp, even back when Paulie’s hair was long and he was dating that Eileen, even after Eileen slept around and Paulie shaved his head, whenever Paulie and Pammy came over they were always on her about the smoking. Which was rude. They had no right. When their father was alive they wouldn’t have dared. When Pammy slapped her hand for adjusting her collar, Paul, Sr., had given her such a wallop.</p><p>The town looked nice. The flags were flying.</p><p>“Ma, did you like your lunch?” Pammy said.</p><p>“I liked it fine,” Alma said.</p><p>At least she didn’t have an old-lady voice. She just had her same voice, like when she was young and nobody had looked better in a tight dress going for cocktails.</p><p>“Ma, I know what,” Pammy said. “How about we walk up Pickle Street?”</p><p>What was Pammy trying to do? Cripple her? They’d been out for two hours already. Paulie’d slept late and missed lunch. He’d just flown in and, boy, were his arms tired. Paul, Sr., had always said that after a trip. Paulie had not said that. Paulie not having his father’s wit. Plus it looked like rain. Black-blue clouds were hanging over the canal bridge.</p><p>“We’re going home,” she said. “You can drive me out to the grave.”</p><p>“Ma,” Pammy said. “We’re not going to the grave, remember?”</p><p>“We are,” she said.</p><p>At the grave she’d say, Paul, dear, everything came out all right. Paulie flew in and Pammy held my hand, and for once they laid off the smoking crap.</p><p>They were passing the Manfrey place. Once, in the Nixon years, lightning had hit the Manfrey cupola. In the morning a portion of cupola lay on the lawn. She’d walked by with Nipper. Paul, Sr., did not walk Nipper. Walking Nipper being too early. Paul, Sr., had been a bit of a drinker. Paul, Sr., drank a bit with great sophistication. At that time, Paul, Sr., was selling a small device used to stimulate tree growth. You attached it to a tree and supposedly the tree flourished. When Paul, Sr., drank a bit with great sophistication he made up lovely words and sometimes bowed. This distinguished-looking gentleman would appear at your door somewhat sloshed and ask, Were your trees slaggard? Were they gublagging behind the other trees? Did they need to be prodderated? And hold up the little device. In this way they had nearly lost the house. Paul, Sr., was charming. But off-putting. In the sales sense. The efficacy of his tree stimulators was nebulous. Paul, Sr., had said so in his low drunk voice on the night that it had appeared most certain they would lose the house.</p><p>“Mother,” he’d said. “The efficacy of my tree stimulators is nebulous.”</p><p>“Ma,” Pammy said.</p><p>“What?” Alma snapped. “What do you want?”</p><p>“You stopped,” Pammy said.</p><p>“Don’t you think I know it?” she said. “My knees hurt. Daughter dragging me all over town.”</p><p>She had not known it. She knew it now, however. They were opposite the shop where the men used to cut pipe. Now it was a Lean&amp;Fit. The time they nearly lost the house, Paulie had come to their bed with a cup of pennies. He was bald these days and sold ad space in the PennySaver. Pammy worked at No Animals Need Die. That was the actual name. Place smelled like hemp. On the shirts and hats for sale were cartoons of cows saying things like “Thanks for Not Slamming a Bolt Through My Head.”</p><p>And as children they’d been so bright. She remembered Paulie’s Achievement Award. One boy had wept when he didn’t get one. But Paulie’d got one. Yet they’d turned out badly. Worked dumb jobs and had never married and were always talking about their feelings.</p><p>Something had spoiled Paulie and Pammy. Well, it wasn’t her. She’d always been firm. Once, she’d left them at the zoo for disobeying. When she’d told them to stop feeding the giraffe they’d continued. She’d left them at the zoo and gone for a cocktail, and when she returned Pammy and Paulie were standing repentant at the front gate, zoo balloons deflated. That had been a good lesson in obedience. A month later, at Ed Pedloski’s funeral, when, with a single harsh look, she’d ordered them to march past the open coffin, they’d marched past the open coffin lickety-split, no shenanigans.</p><p>Poor Ed had looked terrible, having been found after several days on his kitchen floor.</p><p>“Ma, you<span data-page="page_2"></span> O.K.?” Pammy said.</p><p>“Don’t be ridiculous,” Alma said.</p><p>In the early days she and Paul, Sr., had done it every which way. Afterward they’d lie on the floor discussing what colors to paint the walls. But then the children came. And they were bad. They cried and complained, they pooped at idiotic random times, they stepped on broken glass, they’d wake from their naps and pull down the window shades as she lay on the floor with Paul, Sr., not yet having done it any which way, and she’d have to rise exasperated, which would spoil everything, and when she came back Paul, Sr., would be out in the distant part of the yard having a minuscule perschnoggle.</p><p>Soon Paul, Sr., was staying out all night. Who could blame him? Home was no fun. Due to Pammy and Paulie. Drastic measures were required. She bought the wildest underthings. Started smoking again. Once, she let Paul, Sr., spank her bare bottom as she stood in just heels at the refrigerator. Once, in the yard, she crouched down, schnockered, waiting to leap out at Paul, Sr. And, leaping out, found him pantsless. That was part of it. The craziness. Part of their grand love. Like when she’d find Paul, Sr., passed out on the porch and have to help him to bed. That was also part of their grand love. Even that time he very funnily called her Milly. One night she and Paul, Sr., stood outside, at a window, drinks in hand, watching Paulie and Pammy wander from room to room, frantically trying to find them. That had—that had been in fun. That had been funny. When they finally went back in, the kids were so relieved. Pammy burst into tears, and Paulie began pounding Paul, Sr., so fiercely in the groin with his tiny fists that he had to be sent to—</p><p>Well, he certainly had not been sent to sleep in the garden shed in the dark of night. As he always claimed. They would not have done that. They had—probably they’d laughed it off. In their free-spirited way. Then sent him to bed. For hitting. After which, probably, he’d run out and hidden in that shed. Rebelliously. They’d searched and searched. Searching and searching, heroically, they’d finally found him in the shed, sleeping naughtily across a fertilizer bag, tears streaking the dirt on his—</p><p>Why had he been crying when he was supposedly hiding rebelliously?</p><p>That was all a long time ago.</p><p>She wasn’t getting in the fricking time machine about it.</p><p>Sky was black now over the library.</p><p>If Pammy got her caught out in the rain she would honest to God tear Pammy a new one.</p><p>One Fourth of July, Paul, Sr., had groped her in the mums. He’d liked that. He’d been craving more wildness. O.K., pal, here it is. That did the trick. Around the time of the groping-in-the-mums one ceased hearing the name Milly, ditto Carol Meninger, ditto Evelyn Whoever. One briefly ceased hearing those names and smelling those strange perfumes during that fleeting victorious period of victory-by-wildness. Where had the kids been that magical Fourth of July? Somewhere happy with sparklers, probably. Two sparklers had approached. Then paused. Then departed pronto. Well, that would teach them to spy. That would teach them that adults needed their private time.</p><p>“Behold, kiddies,” Paul, Sr., had slurred drunkenly into her bare back. “Welcome to your painful eyeful.”</p><p>Soon after that wild Fourth came another near-loss-of-house. All wildness ceased. In the absence of wildness the names/perfumes resumed.</p><p>No. A person misremembered. They’d worked shoulder-to-shoulder to save the house, and the entire question of names/perfumes had permanently receded, both of them finding it humorous that anyone could possibly think that Paul, Sr., would even consider—</p><p>She was so tired.</p><p>Stupid Pammy.</p><p>Inconsiderate Pammy.</p><p>“Home,” she said.</p><p>Up ahead, across Pine, sweeping her walk—was that?</p><p>It was.</p><p>Debi Hather. Good God. Was she ever old.</p><p>The strange trashy girl in high school. Big hippie. Tiny head, curly hair, no chest. Look at her over there, still weird: Asian blouse, pants with ties at the ankles, bird-skinny. Who did she think she was, Gandhi or whoever? Mrs. Gandhi?</p><p>Hippie Grammie?</p><p>Sweeping like a banshee in front of that same tiny former carriage house she’d lived in since she was a girl. With her oddball parents. Mandy and Randy. Both had limps. Different limps. When they walked down the street it was like a freaking dance party.</p><p>Now, hang on a <em>briefen</em> short second there, Eisenstein, Paul, Sr., said in her mind. Let’s poise a hyperthetical: Say you were born to gimps and grew up in a tiny house, and never had <em>und potten</em> to piss in. Mightn’t you have turned out a strange lost gal with twelve or so marriages behind you and a tragic runaway daughter?</p><p>No, she answered. I wouldn’t have.</p><p>You know that for a certainty? Paul, Sr., said. Well, maybe I’m just dull. Perhaps I fail to grasp your immensely higher logic. Maybe, having lived a perfect life, you’ve got all the answers.</p><p>Don’t.</p><p>Do not.</p><p>Do not defend that one there.</p><p>I merely pose the query, he said.</p><p>He was bearing down on her in that way of his, not even giving the other person a chance to—</p><p>Wong or white, snook? he said. Clock’s ticking! Answer, please!</p><p>Well, how<span data-page="page_3"></span> should she know? Who she’d be if she weren’t her? Why would you want to even know that? It didn’t amount to anything.</p><p>“Ma, you want to go over, say hi?” Pammy said. “She’s an old friend, right?”</p><p>“Well, she’s old,” Alma said. “But she’s no friend of mine.”</p><p>“Ma, God,” Pammy said.</p><p>“We never had nothing to do with her,” Alma said. “Big hippie. Never meant nothing to us.”</p><p>Not much.</p><p>Not much she hadn’t.</p><p>Zowie! Here came Alma Carlson. Up Pine. Daughter in tow. Pammy or Kimmie or whoever. She’d seen the son, Paulie, at Wegman’s yesterday, arms full of flowers. For Alma (!). Not sure how <em>that</em> worked: Mean Old Thing (Alma) gets Mother’s Day flowers; Nice, Generous Mom (her, Debi!) gets—</p><p>Lord, what a face: shrivelled apple. Drawstring purse pulled tight.</p><p>When was God or whoever going to lower the boom? On a meanie like that? Or did she just get to live out her life, mean as all getout? Oh, God, Schmod, she, Debi, wasn’t a big believer in God or Hell or any of that male-based crap. She’d been no angel herself, having done (yes) a few drugs in her day, and also she didn’t exactly love the idea of showing up at the pearly gates or whatnot and having St. Whoever look her up in his book and go, Whoa, hey, I was just sitting here tabulating the number of guys you had in your life, and, yikes, can you wait here a second while I go check with God on what the limit is?</p><p><em>Sweep</em>, <em>sweep</em>.</p><p>(Why did we use that word when the actual sound was more like <em>swep</em>?)</p><p><em>Swep</em>, <em>swep</em>.</p><p>Because, O.K., yes, she’d loved men. And they’d loved her. Back in the day. For her? It was a form of joyous overflow. Like that art guy on TV who loved to paint so much that sometimes his wife got peeved, and he’d go, holding up his brush, “Joyous overflow, Ruthie! Mea culpa!” She’d been like that. But with sleeping with guys. Ha! She’d enjoyed every last one of them. Even the sleazes. Especially the sleazes! That salesman from Ohio! With his little blindfolds? What had <em>that</em> been about? Did he carry them everywhere? Apparently! But, God bless him, that was just <em>him</em>, that was his <em>thing</em>. Everyone had a thing, or several things, and her view was, if you loved the universe (which she did, or liked to think she did, or, anyway, sure <em>tried</em> to), you had to love <em>all of it</em>. Even Mr. Ohio (Tom? Tim?) with his little blindfold case. Where was he now? He’d been like fifteen years older than her. So he’d be . . . what? In a home? Dead? Having his own interesting conversation with St. Whoever? Re the blindfolds? Re the not exactly stopping when she’d asked—</p><p>But even that—you learned something from everything. Or, at least, she did. What she’d learned from Mr. Ohio was—</p><p>Well, she wasn’t sure.</p><p>Don’t date guys from Ohio.</p><p>Ha.</p><p>What a hoot.</p><p><em>Swep</em>.</p><p>Tim/Tom from Ohio had been followed by who? Whom? Carl, then Tobin, then the Lawrence/Gary combo. After that it got blurry. Lord, what a roster! She’d really lived. Had not discriminated between tall/short, nerdy/cool, married/not married, whatever. No blockages. No hangups. If you’re interested in me, I thank you for that, I bow to that part of you that bows to me, let’s get it on. Ha. No, really, she recanted exactly <em>none</em> of it. Why recant openness to the moment? Bring it! Even now, bring it! Open, open, open! She ought to run across Pine and give Alma a hug. That would freak the old bitch out.</p><p>But no. If she’d learned anything in her life it was: you had to accept people the way they were.</p><p>Like Vicky. Her daughter. Whoever Vicky had been at any given moment, she, Debi, had accepted it. When Vicky wanted to be a bookworm and wear those big cloddy boots and memorize everything about the French Revolution and always be tidying up the house and scrubbing the toilets and whatnot, she’d been like, Go for it, kiddo, I accept you. When Vicky wanted to mow the lawn because the parade was this weekend, and the whole town would see how long their grass was (as if <em>that</em> were a thing), have at it, <em>amiga</em>, even though you’re only like eight, reach way up and dig in with your cloddy boots and push that big heavy mower, I won’t be embarrassed about it at all.</p><p>Whatever Vicky had wanted to be, that had been fine with her.</p><p>Only wouldn’t it have been cool if what Vicky had wanted to be was a less subservient, more out-there type of girl, so self-assured that nothing ever threw her? Somehow she’d got stuck with the wrong kid. Which made for some tension. Vicky was so <em>uptight</em>. Everything had to be <em>perfect</em>. Like once Vicky brought over this nice young guy, Rob, and she, Debi, made them mac-and-cheese, but there was no milk, as she’d been getting the runaround from Phil, or maybe it was Dennis, and was a little distracted and hadn’t been to the store in a week or two, so she made it with strawberry yogurt, and the kids declined to eat it, and she pointed out (just being honest) that they must be<span data-page="page_4"></span> a couple of pretty privileged humans if they were turning up their noses at what would pass, in ninety per cent of the world, for a fucking <em>feast</em>, and at the F-word Rob (the son of <em>surgeons</em>) had blanched or blushed or whatever (basically looked like he was about to throw up and/or fall over from shock), and Vicky had started stuttering, and all that time Vicky—she remembered this in particular, this detail being so classically <em>Vicky</em> (big self-sabotager)—had kept her <em>retainer</em> on, like a harmonica holder. With a boy over! What was <em>that</em> about?</p><p>So, yes: tense. Tense between them. Tenser and tenser. Finally, senior year, Vicky had pulled this really skillful tension-release move. Of bolting. Running off. With that little punk Al Fowler and his stringbean cousin. Al came back a few months later, said they’d left her in Phoenix, she was being a total bitch.</p><p>Two weeks after that, a postcard: “Ma I’m fine don’t try to find me.”</p><p>And that was that.</p><p>Thirty-two years ago.</p><p>Not a word since.</p><p><em>Swep</em>.</p><p>It was what it was.</p><p>But you know what? Actually? She felt good about it. She did. She’d raised an independent young woman. A young woman so intent on getting what she needed she hadn’t even bothered to say goodbye. To her own mother. That was bold. That was awesome. She’d raised a warrior princess. Because if Vicky <em>had</em> said goodbye Debi would have tried to talk her out of it. She’d loved that kid so much. She would have said, like, O.K., look, agreed, I’m a mess, there are too many men in my life, I’m not always available to help you with—whatever, algebra or whatnot—but give me another chance, and I’ll be more focussed on <em>you</em> and <em>your</em> needs, and will totally disavow who <em>I</em> am (a person always trying to say <em>yes</em> to life) and will do my best (hereby resolved!) to start saying <em>no</em> to life, and very fakely pouring myself into that constricting mold you seem to prefer me in (“Perfect Robotic Mother”), so that nothing I do will ever challenge you in the least or make you step even an inch outside your tiny restrictive comfort—</p><p>Alma was paused now across the street. Glaring at her. As if stuck.</p><p>What’s up, kid? What do you want? A bow? A salute? A wave?</p><p>Here you go, pal.</p><p>Care to wave back, Your Majesty?</p><p>No?</p><p>Fine.</p><p>Far be it from her to judge. Anyone. At any time. To judge was to dominate. To place yourself above another. Which she refused to do. Some would. Many did.</p><p>Not her.</p><p>Although wouldn’t it be a hoot when Alma kicked the bucket and St. Whoever was like, Why so mean? Why so proud? Why such a hypocrite? Did you not find life beautiful? Where was your <em>heart</em>? Why did you squander your precious life force trying to possess, control, <em>interfere</em>?</p><p>And Alma, newly dead, would stand there, stunned, like, I’m having a realization right now. Who was correct? Debi. Who was wrong? Me, Alma. Then they’d show the movie of her life, and Alma would see what a fuckhound Paul was and that would really drive it all home.</p><p>Would she, Debi, be standing nearby, inside Heaven, looking on, amused? No. Because she was going to outlive Alma.</p><p>Ha.</p><p>No. Let’s say she was dead. She’d be like, I knew you in life, Alma. Do you remember me?</p><p>Gosh, Debi, hi, I do, Alma would say. And I am so sorry. I was always a super-snoot to you.</p><p>Yes, you were, she’d say. But I forgive you.</p><p>And St. Whoever would look over, all impressed, like, Wow, even though she always treated you like crap, you are being totally cool to her right now.</p><p>But then again you fucked my husband, Alma would say. Like a gazillion times. According to that movie I just now watched. Even when I was in the hospital having Pammy.</p><p>Does that come as a surprise to you? St. Whoever would say. About your husband?</p><p>It does, yes, Alma would say. I lived in a state of self-imposed blindness, never seeking truth.</p><p>That’s too bad, St. Whoever would say. That’s some bad juju right there. What is the greater sin, do you think, adultery or standing in the way of true love?</p><p>I don’t know, Alma would say.</p><p>Standing in the way of true love, St. Whoever would say.</p><p>But he was my <em>husband</em>, Alma would say.</p><p>Well, marriage is just a shallow cultural tradition, St. Whoever would say. At least, it is to us up here.</p><p>She fucked him and fucked him, Alma would say, all crestfallen. Right under my nose. And I never knew.</p><p>And yet here I am in Heaven, Debi would say. Think about it.</p><p>Ha. That had all just popped out.</p><p>The creative mind, wow.</p><p>Especially hers.</p><p>Well, Paul had deserved better. Than Alma. He was so sweet. You got the feeling that, in being a fuckhound, he was just acting on his true nature. He took so much joy in it, flattered you so sincerely after, never ignored you in public, like so many did, but always lit up when he saw you and sometimes even gave you a wink, with Alma standing right there, which was weirdly delicious, because Alma (she had to admit it) had always had this<span data-page="page_5"></span> sort of <em>glamour</em>, being one of the older girls and (oh, she could give her this much) really pretty. One time, at some sort of yard party, Paul had given Debi that wink and they’d snuck off to a pool shed or some such, and afterward, when he rejoined Alma, who was (as she so often was back then, ha ha) looking worried, Paul put his hand right on Alma’s ass while giving her, Debi, a second wink, and Alma had brightened so sweetly at his hand on her ass, as if it really <em>meant</em> something to her, that, thinking of that pathetic little brightening now, she, Debi, felt a twinge of sisterhood, as in “Men are pigs, sister, are they not?,” although, at the time, not so much, because she’d just been dumped by either Derek or Clive, and that second wink (which meant, as she took it, “<em>Das Wifen</em> has no clue how bondingly naughty it was for you to go down on me just now while sitting on that tub of chlorine”) had just made her really, really happy.</p><p>Could that guy ever talk! “I am maximally ardent <em>pour toi</em>,” he’d said. She’d written that one down. In her Krazee Jernel. Those were the days! You did whoever, then wrote about it in your Krazee Jernel.</p><p>How could Alma not have known? What a fucker Paul had been? Literally? Debi, Linda, Milly K., that Iranian gal, both Porter sisters, Mag Kelly, Evelyn Sonderstrom. And those were just the ones she personally knew about! Everyone knew. How could Alma not know? You’d walk around town and there’d be tall pale nerdy Paul sneaking out of some house, or leading some gal (her, Debi, ha, guilty as charged) around back of St. Jude’s for a quickie, humming “Kumbaya” ironically. A few days after that, he’d sent her a bracelet. Nice bracelet, actually. Still had it. She should donate it. To a women’s shelter. Jesus, who had she <em>been</em> back then? Doinking a married guy? Behind a church?</p><p>No, you know what? She loved that woman. <em>Praised</em> that woman. That woman she’d been: authentic, spontaneous, never thought twice. About anything.</p><p>Just <em>leapt</em>.</p><p>Sometimes it was so frustrating! To have been born in the wrong time! In the future, she was pretty sure, people would be open and free, and fuck whoever they wanted, and live communally, all responsibilities shared, and if you dug cooking and cleaning and whatnot you’d do that, or if you were more creative, and felt more authentic hanging out with others, offering counsel re their problems, smoking a little hash to go deeper, you’d do that. Nobody would own anything or anyone. Everyone would do exactly what he liked and nobody would gossip about anyone or look down on anyone or consider anyone slutty, and all the houses would be exactly the same size, and if someone started to build some fancy addition, <em>bang</em>, everyone would be right there, going, <em>No you don</em>’<em>t</em>, <em>we are all equal here</em>, and if the person made a fuss about it, they’d simply—well, there’d be some sort of council. That would very fairly and systematically bring that élitist down. To their level. Make her live in a smaller house. For penance. And some of that wiser subgroup who had chosen to give counsel and smoke hash might symbolically take over the oppressor’s house. Just temporarily. And her husband. Until she was genuinely sorry. And if the élitist resisted, and refused to be genuinely sorry (as judged by them, the wiser subgroup), she could stay in that much smaller house until she relented, while the wiser group gathered outside, taunting her, enacting a sort of virtuous blockade, until she was nearly dying of hunger and—</p><p>It was so unfair. She’d loved Paul and Paul had loved her, but she’d never got to live with him for even a single minute, and then he’d broken it off, and she’d had to drive by his house every day on her way to that stupid receptionist job, watching that ugly new addition go up (and up and up), and sometimes there’d be Alma, standing cross-armed amid the framing, smugly smoking.</p><p>And yet.</p><p>Who’d triumphed? Who was happy? Who was happy right now? Was Alma? She didn’t look very happy.</p><p>She, Debi, was happy.</p><p>Happy in this moment, just as it was. Wind picking up, clouds dark over the Rec, left heel out of her slipper: perfect.</p><p>Game, set, match: Debi.</p><p>Life was harsh, people said. But no. She disagreed. Life was wise. Life <em>compensated</em>. The love of your life broke it off, and many years passed, and your kid ran off, and that about killed you, but then, laid low, you were forced to take stock, see what had been good in your life, see what had been best, and when your answer was “Paul. Paul was the best thing that ever happened to me,” you drifted back to him, sought him out, sort of lured him back into it, into you, and what did you get? The happiest year of your life. Of both your lives. He said so. “I’ve never been so happy. That’s the truth.” His exact words. So she had that. Then he died. Just her luck.</p><p>She couldn’t exactly show up at Chasen-Winney for visiting hours, so she’d snuck out to the grave a few<span data-page="page_6"></span> days later, bawling her eyes out. Then here came Alma. As always. The Interferer, the Truncator. In that sweet red Granada that Paul had just bought her. For her birthday. Ouch. Off she, Debi, had scurried, through the woods, ruining her new black pumps, because (who knew?) there was a <em>swamp</em> back there, eventually stumbling out, like some sort of dispirited ghost, at Wendy’s, where she’d had a milkshake, clay-red mud pooling up around her wrecked shoes, that mopping kid looking over at her, like, Lady, it’s weird that you’re crying in Wendy’s. Please leave, so I can clean your shit up.</p><p>And then she’d had to call Carl from work to drive her back to the graveyard to get her Dart.</p><p>The end.</p><p>Alone ever since.</p><p><em>Swep</em>.</p><p>“Ma, jeez, wave back,” Pammy said. “You’re acting nuts.”</p><p>I don’t believe I will, Alma thought.</p><p>“She’s just some old lady,” Pammy said. “Why hurt her feelings? Anyways, that’s what I think.”</p><p>“That’s because you don’t know shit about anything,” Alma said. “Look at you. What have you ever done?”</p><p>The breeze was suddenly cold, and leaves were skittering around.</p><p>Oh, great. Now Pammy was mad. Boo-hoo. Pammy was touchy. Dainty. Who knew why? She’d always treated Pammy-Putt square.</p><p>Ha. Pammy-Putt. She’d almost forgotten they used to call her that. Pammy-Putt. With the pigtails. At the end of one pigtail a pink tie and at the end of the other a yellow. Because Pammy-Putt wanted it like that. Little Pammy-Putt, standing on the footstool, confidently directing the pigtailing. She hadn’t thought of that in—she could smell that kid’s head now. Sort of sweet. Cloverish. Where had that smell gone? Where had that confident little gal—</p><p>Once, Pammy-Putt came home from second grade asking what a <em>laughingstock</em> was. And what was a <em>philanderer</em>? Who’d said those things? Alma demanded. Who’d been telling those filthy lies? She’d had a few nips. So was forceful. Pammy wouldn’t cough up a name. So she’d had Pammy stand on one foot awhile. Then Pammy-Putt got her mouth good and scrubbed with soap for disobeying a direct—</p><p>The church bells at St. Caspian’s rang once, twice, three times.</p><p>Now here came the rain. Perfect. Stupid Pammy. Eight blocks from home. Her knees were shot. What’s the plan, Pam? You carrying me? Pammy had a bad back. Pammy wasn’t carrying shit.</p><p>Some little hail-thingies came bouncing up off the sidewalk.</p><p>Pretty.</p><p>Ouch. Not pretty.</p><p>Hey! Damn! What the—</p><p>“Ma, we better run for it,” Pammy said.</p><p>Run? You run. I can’t, dummy, I haven’t run in—</p><p>Then she was. Running. Kind of. Behind Pammy. God, the shuffling funny way they ran now. The hail stung her arms like wasps. Wasps coming straight down. A lemon-sized hail-thingie smashed on the sidewalk in front of them like a snow cone.</p><p>Holy crap, if that hit a person?</p><p>Pammy had her sweatshirt off now and was holding it up. Over Alma’s head. Lord, what a kid. Standing there in her bra, bare pink arms up. So her ma wouldn’t get zoinked. Hair full of the smaller-size hail-thingies, like the plastic beadlets on them old Catholic—</p><p>She felt a rush of tenderness for Pammy.</p><p>Something clipped Pammy in the head, and a red mini-divot appeared at her hairline. Pammy seemed stunned. Too stunned to move. A tree? By the Ubernicks’. She pushed Pammy over by the tree. That was better. No, it wasn’t. The hail was cutting right down through the branches now. A shower of snapped branches crashed down on the Ubernicks’ fence: one, two, threefourfive. Jesus, they had to get out of here. One more branch came down, caught her on the shoulder. Hey, that hurt, clown! Like the time Karl Metz had whacked her with that hammer.</p><p>Someone was calling her name.</p><p>From across the street.</p><p>The hail-thingies bouncing off Debi’s black umbrella looked like sweat flying off a cartoon-guy’s head when he was supposed to be worried. Paul, Sr., had once shown her a porn like that. A cartoon porn. The one Paulie later found. Guy so worried, watching his wife have at it with a big sailor or—</p><p>It wouldn’t do. Wouldn’t do having Debi help. Or would it? It might. It wouldn’t. Paul had liked that one too much. Of all of them, he’d liked her best and stayed at her longest and gone back to her way after all the others were done. It was humiliating. That he should stay longest with the trashiest, strangest of all, always speaking kindly of her, as if he actually might—</p><p>Old man. Stupid old man. Old man in love. Old man so happy, in his boxers, in front of the fan, telling her all about it, like she was supposed to be happy, happy for him, happy for—</p><p>She waved Debi off.</p><p>We don’t need you, slut. We won’t have you.</p><p>She leaned against the Ubernicks’ fence. Dirty fence. Someone should paint it.</p><p>“Ma?” Pammy said, trickle of blood running down her face. “You O.K.? Ma?”</p><p>She pushed Pammy off. She couldn’t breathe. When pushed off, Pammy stayed off. Pammy was like that. Sweet but weak. No bounceback. You could push her right off.</p><p>The fence gave way. The ground came up. Ouch. Cheap fence. She ought to sue those stupid Uber—</p><p>She was on the ground now, severed bike pedal huge in her sight, ant crawling along<span data-page="page_7"></span> it. The fence was up. Still up. Hadn’t given way. Only she had. Why the hell was she on the ground?</p><p>Oh, God, something with her heart, something with her—</p><p>The church bells at St. Caspian’s rang once, twice, three times.</p><p>Rain coming. What a drag.</p><p>She’d be stuck inside all day.</p><p>Across Pine, the Denisons’ sunflowers were bending in the breeze. Alma and what’s-her-name were standing hunched over like a couple of lady trolls. Mom troll and daughter troll, out on the troll town. On Troll Mother’s Day. How nice. How sweet. How weird.</p><p>One last <em>swep</em>.</p><p>Here it came.</p><p>Let it rain! Jesus, what a deluge! Bring it! Yes! Gorgeous! Memo from Mother Nature: I can be one crazy dame. Don’t piss me off, I shall instantaneously make Pine Street a river and back up the gutters and cast forth (whoa! dang!) a torrent of tiny pinging crystals, which you humans call “hail,” but which I, Mother Nature, call “my wondrous display,” which shall resound or rebound to the music I play, such that they shall—whoa! dang! fuck!—ricochet up off the rain-slick black street and come bouncing back as high as your waist, falling alike on the lowly and the—</p><p>Walnuts!</p><p>Golf balls!</p><p>Sheesh!</p><p>Damn!</p><p>How was Alma doing over there? Not great. Getting pounded. Ha! There you go, kid. There’s an example of world-serving-as-teacher. Try snooting your way out of this one, Your Majesty.</p><p>From somewhere came the sound of a parade, that distant-drum sound, which was weird, because wouldn’t it have been cancelled? On account of the hail? Only it wasn’t a parade; it was the sound the biggest hailstones yet made smashing down on (yikes!) the Ubernicks’ Fiesta, the Neillys’ trash can, which—oof!—tumped over (as if knocked unconscious) and rolled directly out onto Pine.</p><p>Pammy or Cammie or whoever had her shirt off now and was making a tent of it, over Alma.</p><p>Over her mother.</p><p>Kind of sweet, actually.</p><p>Oh, hell’s bells, hang on, somewhere in this mess she must have a—</p><p>She stepped in, grabbed Dad’s duck-handled umbrella from the rack, stepped out.</p><p>Because who was she? She was Debi. Who was Debi? Debi was generous, a generous soul. She was known for that—she gave and gave and reached out to others, no matter how badly they’d treated her, even a meanie like Alma, who (yes, O.K., she admitted it) she’d often wished dead, so that she might have a decent chance at the man she loved and a real house and all the things you were supposed to get in this world—but, no, she didn’t wish Alma dead anymore, because she, Debi, was <em>love</em>, was <em>forgiveness</em>, was <em>goodness</em>, was <em>light;</em> where there was need there was Debi, which was why she was about to do what she was about to—</p><p>She stepped out, umbrella up, yelled across.</p><p>Wait.</p><p>Wait a minute.</p><p>Had Alma waved her off?</p><p>She had. Oh, my God. You have got to be kidding. What nerve! What balls! Still queen? Peasant girl still too lowly? To come fetch you, Your Highness?</p><p>Stick it, Alma.</p><p>Let this be a lesson to you.</p><p><em>There is some shit I will not eat</em>.</p><p>Because she, Debi, was also a person who had the wisdom to let the world teach the evil ones a lesson while she stood calmly by, watching/trusting the cosmos.</p><p>She stepped back inside, slammed the door, shot the umbrella into the stand, retreated to the middle room, Mom and Dad’s old room, angrily pulled her tax things from the file cabinet, sat shuffling the forms uselessly around, thinking of how strange it was (beautiful, really, a mysterious unsought blessing) that, after a lifetime of being everybody’s joke (easy lay, jilted lover, discarded mom), she was finally (in the eleventh hour) learning to frigging stand up for herself.</p><p>She stayed in there about fifteen minutes, fuming, getting absolutely nothing done, until she heard the first ambulance arrive and leapt to the window, heart in her throat, and watched as, without even trying the shocking-paddles, they pulled the sheet up over Alma’s head and loaded her in.</p><p>Debi’s mind lurched forward, sputtered, went (momentarily) quiet.</p><p>Alma got hold of a fence slat. To pull—pull herself out. Of this. Pain. Something new was happening now. The tightness in her chest was worse. Jesus. Like labor with Paulie. Then it went past that, to labor with Pammy, and she was giving birth to something bigger than Pammy, out her chest.</p><p>God, oh God.</p><p><em>Pop!</em> is how she would have described it had she still been able to describe.</p><p><em>Pop</em>.</p><p>A number of little beings came now. God, get back. You didn’t know whether to pet them or kick them. As they gazed up at her intently, she saw they were saying, <em>Careful</em>, <em>girlie</em>, <em>careful</em>.</p><p>Then their boss-being came: a man.</p><p>Paul, Sr.</p><p>Looking so handsome.</p><p>“Did you finally wake up, dear?” she said. “And love the right person? The one who knew you longest and understood you best?”</p><p>Looking at him, she saw the answer was no.</p><p>Still no.</p><p>The little beings condensed into two. Boy and a girl. Paul tapped them on the head and they turned into babies. Who stood cowering beside Paul. Giving her the stink eye. Like he was guarding them. From what? From her? In a pig’s ass! It was his fault! He<span data-page="page_final"></span> never let us be a family!</p><p>“Now will you accept me as I am?” Paul said.</p><p>What? What a crock! How about you accept <em>me</em> as <em>I</em> am? Treat me nice. Like a wife. A real wife. Forsake all others. Love just <em>me</em>. Is that too much to ask?</p><p>She saw it was still a no and always would be.</p><p>It hurt. So much. Again. Well, if he wanted a fight, she knew how to fight. She liked it. She was good at it. She’d make him pay. The way she always had. You’d think he’d know that by—</p><p>She looked down. Her hands were glowing. Glowing red.</p><p>“This has nothing to do with him,” the girl baby said. “How do <em>you</em> want to be?”</p><p>How could that baby talk so well? She was like a little genius. In a diaper. And what did she mean? It had everything to do with him. He’d done it all. Turned everything bad. Before Paul had messed with her, she’d been a smiling little dear sniffing lilacs on graduation day, swinging her diploma by one corner. It was Paul. Paul who’d made her hands this way. She went to wipe her eyes and started her hair on fire.</p><p>No problem.</p><p>Didn’t hurt.</p><p>Much.</p><p>Now Paul was gone. The babies looked lost. She should pick them up. She went for the boy. His eyes got wide at her hot hands. He toddled away. She went for the girl. She toddled away. It was like when you dropped a piece of paper on a windy day and it grew a mind bent on eluding you. She stood still. The babies drifted back. They wanted her. But she had the hand problem. She went for the boy. Who toddled away. She went for the girl. Who toddled away.</p><p>Then it happened again.</p><p>And again.</p><p>For like a hundred years.</p><p>A stump appeared. At some point.</p><p>At least now she could sit.</p><p>She sat trying to figure it out.</p><p>It seemed she was meant to admit that she was wrong. But she wasn’t. If she was wrong about this, there was no right.</p><p>Maybe she could fake it.</p><p>“O.K., O.K.,” she said aloud. “I was wrong. The whole time. About everything.”</p><p>Hands still hot.</p><p>The stump began rising. Lifting her above the babies. Then: a terrible bark-cackling. The beings were back. With big old teeth.</p><p>Here they came, scrambling hyena-like across a vast plain.</p><p>Real baby-eaters.</p><p>Lord, so fast. She’d have to hoist the babies up. She reached down, grabbed the boy, singed his little arm.</p><p>How to do it, how to do it, how to get her hands to cool?</p><p>“Whose fault was it?” the girl baby asked.</p><p>“His!” Alma cried. “His, his, his!”</p><p>Her arms went hot right up to the elbows. Big bully! Whoever’d made her this way, unable to lie, was jerking her around now because she wouldn’t lie.</p><p>The hyena-beings were closing in, all meat-breath and yellow teeth.</p><p>“Whose?” the girl baby said. “Whose fault?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” she cried desperately. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I really don’t! Mine? My fault?”</p><p>“No,” the girl baby said.</p><p>What the hell? Fine, forget the babies, she’d keep the hot hands. She was what she was. No one could blame her. As long as she was Alma, she’d be mad. She had a right. Did she <em>want</em> to be mad? No. What she wanted to be was her, younger. Her, non-mad. Her, not yet mad. Pre-Paul. Smelling lilacs, swinging that diploma. No, even before that: so young she wanted nothing yet, liked nothing, disliked nothing. No, before that: before she was even Alma, because Alma would always find Paul, love Paul, and Paul would always be Paul.</p><p>It came to her, and then was happening: it would be fixed when she stopped being Alma.</p><p>Her arms and hands went cool and pale, perfectly normal.</p><p>She reached down, hauled the babies up.</p><p>“Who do you <em>want</em> to be?” the girl baby whispered into her ear as the stump rose just high enough to keep them safe from the hyena-beings bark-cackling below.</p><p>It was like waiting at the top of the Alpine in that little wooden car, unable to believe that what was about to happen was about to happen, and then, even as you thought, God, oh God, this cannot possibly—</p><p>“Nobody even close to home in there,” the paramedic named Henry said to the paramedic named Claire.</p><p>Which was rude, Claire thought. But actually, no, it was fine: the daughter was out of earshot, sobbing against a tree. ♦</p>	George Saunders	February 8 & 15, 2016 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/02/08/mothers-day-fiction-george-saunders	Books	Children	Daughters	Love Affairs	Marriages	Memories	Alma	Third	Children
Signal	<p>I tried to give the children an etiquette lesson while we were waiting at King’s Cross on December 30th.</p><p>“You aren’t allowed to ask for the Wi-Fi password before you say hello,” I said. “That’s the main thing.”</p><p>“Uncle Mike won’t care,” said Toby, who was nine.</p><p>“He’s nice,” said Mia, who was seven.</p><p>“Both of those things are true,” I said. “Uncle Mike is nice, and he wouldn’t care, but this is a life lesson. It’s just not what you do. You say hello, you chat for a bit, and then you ask for the Wi-Fi password. It’s just one of the rules.”</p><p>“Fear? That’s the other guy’s problem,” Toby said. We had recently let him stay up too late to watch “Trading Places,” and this line had made a profound impact.</p><p>Michael wasn’t my oldest friend and he wasn’t my closest friend, but he was older than any of the ones who were closer and closer than any of the ones who were older, so he had a special status, as part of the furniture of my life, the kind of friend who when you’re asked how you met you have to think for a while to remember. What he certainly was, though, unequivocally and by a huge margin, was my richest friend. Michael was loaded, seriously and unambiguously loaded. He was the kind of rich that even other people who were rich considered rich. He had made the money himself. It was all the more impressive because Michael seemed barely to have noticed. His peers and friends and rivals and colleagues were all amazed by the fact that Mike was now some kind of gazillionaire, but it didn’t seem to make much impression on Michael himself.</p><p>He’d drifted through Cambridge doing something scientific—engineering or maths, I think it was. I’d always thought that, like me, he was going to be an academic, but Michael had got a first and then stumbled into the City, and then shuffled or ambled through an escalating series of jobs in finance before “going off to try something a bit different,” and at that point it became clear that he had ascended to some new stratosphere of international wealth. The first sign was when he invited us to join him on holiday for a week, and that turned out to mean a helicopter pickup in Battersea taking us to a private jet at Northolt, taking us to a yacht the size of a municipal tennis facility, and a week’s cruising in the Med. And still it was never clear how Michael had done what he’d done. This was a characteristic that had been salient from the time we first met, at university, his ambient, all-purpose, omnidirectional vagueness. It was a well-meaning vagueness, but it could also be highly irritating, and there were certain situations in which it more or less guaranteed disaster, such as anything involving social life.</p><p>This was shaping up to be another of those occasions. Michael had “bought a little place,” as he put it, which, after he mentioned the address and I did a certain amount of cyberstalking, turned out to mean an estate of several thousand acres in North Yorkshire. The previous owner had suddenly died and the estate had been sold, in the flattering and far from accurate language of the only newspaper report, to a “mystery financier.” Michael had invited us to go up for New Year’s Eve about a month earlier and Kate and I couldn’t resist, despite knowing that, while the setting was guaranteed to be amazing, from the social point of view it was likely to be chaotic, or hard work, or both. On the other hand, we knew that halfway through the alleged holidays we’d be hallucinating with fatigue, and three days with someone else looking after our lovely but exhausting little ones would feel like the kind of thing that should be available on the National Health Service.</p><p>The trip up north felt like punishment for our hubristic attempt to change holiday routine. King’s Cross was a maelstrom. The stress was magnified by the fact that Michael had said, by text, only that we’d be met at the station, without saying exactly where or by whom. Network Rail seemed to pride itself on displaying platform information at the last possible moment, so we were quivering like greyhounds as we waited to run to the train. Toby and Mia hadn’t eaten and were holiday-cranky, and were demanding a trip to the Harry Potter Shop and to Platform 9¾. We didn’t know what we’d be doing at the house, or how fancy it would be, and as a result had overpacked. It was a perfect storm of travel stress and bad omens. Kate looked at me.</p><p>“This is a look of mute reproach,” she said.</p><p>“Yep,” I said. “Sorry. We’ll wait for the platform info, get to our seats, and hope it sorts itself out at the other end.”</p><p>“Unless he just forgot.”</p><p>“No, he never forgets,” I said, which was true: Michael might mis- or dis-organize things, but he never plain forgot them.</p><p>The rest of the journey was both better and worse than I had expected. There were as many people standing as sitting, and when I say standing I mean lurching, swaying, listening to music at the perfect volume<span data-page="page_2"></span> to irritate everyone within a five-metre radius. Add to that overheating, an unexplained twenty-minute delay after Peterborough, and two motion-sickness-prone children. We got off at York and, in the general mayhem, Kate found a driver carrying a sign with a misspelled version of our surname. The subsequent ninety-minute car trip through the Yorkshire dark, stopping only twice, for children’s pee and vomit breaks, was a week at Jumeirah Dubai by comparison.</p><p>The driveway of Michael’s big house was so long that even after we got there it took a while to get there. The four of us came out of the cold into a double-height entrance hallway, to be greeted by no one at all, apart from a very, very tall man, at least six feet five, who was looking at his mobile phone as if he was struggling to get reception, and more interested in that than in any other form of human interaction. His response to a family of four bursting through the door was to do nothing except scowl at us, then drift toward the side hallway. The rudeness was compounded by an air of complete coldness and disconnection, as if he couldn’t have cared less whether we lived or died.</p><p>“Hello,” Toby said. “Very nice to meet you. My name is Toby. How do you do? Also, would you mind awfully telling me the Wi-Fi password?”</p><p>While Kate and I spluttered and glared at our firstborn, the man continued to walk away and vanished around the corner. Silence settled in the entrance hall of the big house. There was a stag’s head on the far wall. Large portraits of formally dressed people from previous centuries frowned from above the unlit fireplace. Presumably, they were ancestors of the previous owner. The unwelcoming, inhospitable, eerie quiet loomed and grew. It seemed, for a moment, as if we didn’t really exist. It seemed, for a moment, as if coming here for the holiday had been a very bad idea indeed.</p><p>Then, as in a farce, from the other side of the hall came four members of the household staff in uniform; a smartly dressed couple in early middle age arguing heatedly in French; and our host, who was carrying a pair of roller skates and a copy of a book called “Option Volatility &amp; Pricing,” by Sheldon Natenberg, thickly interleaved with Post-it notes.</p><p>“The four-fifteen,” Michael said. He hadn’t forgotten that we were arriving, but he had forgotten that we would be arriving at that exact moment, so he was too distracted to greet us or smile or say hello. “Pickup at, say, four-thirty,” he said to himself. “Ninety minutes across the moors. A few extra minutes for other journey variables. Six-thirty.” He looked at his watch. “Yes!” And then suddenly there was the sweet smile and the abrupt sense of warmth and intimacy, which was why, after all, people did love him. “Yes!” he said and hugged Mia and then Toby and then Kate and me. He hugged like a natural non-toucher who had taken professional instruction in how to overcome his instincts and hug, and then found, greatly to his own surprise, that he liked it. Which, in fact, was what he was, and the reason I know is that I gave him the course, “I Hate Hugging: Overcoming Your Fear of Intimacy Through Touch,” as a fortieth-birthday present.</p><p>After that, everything became better. I don’t mean better from the social point of view, because Michael still didn’t know how to introduce people, and, that evening, as we tried to work out who was who, it became clear that he had done exactly what we suspected, and invited an essentially random group consisting of us, a large selection of work acquaintances who didn’t know one another, and a few people he’d barely met but had asked at the last minute.</p><p>It seemed that there were roughly two dozen of us. Even the numbers were unclear and appeared to fluctuate from meal to meal, and there was never any seating plan or organization or itinerary or sense that anyone had thought about how to make the whole thing work. Balancing that, making the event feel like a lovely escape from reality, was the wonderfulness of the house itself, and the openhandedness with which it was run. The house looked big from the front, but we quickly realized that it was much bigger still, built like a ship with its narrow end facing the lawn and the drive. The bulk of the building stretched out backward and included, from a tired parent’s point of view, every possible amenity you could think of. There was a video-game room, there was a retro-gaming room, there was a home cinema, there was a bouncy castle in a heated and covered area outdoors. There was a swimming pool; there was a multisized inventory of bicycles. There was a dedicated children’s library, with books ascending in age range from the floor level upward.</p><p>Michael gave us the tour, in his habitual style (“Um—pinball machine”).</p><p>“I’ve never seen so much stuff for kids—it’s like a kids’ hotel,” I said.</p><p>“Previous owner. Mad about them,” Michael said. “I like it, means I don’t have to think about what kids want. I know that sounds a bit selfish, but you know what I mean.”</p><p>I did. “It’s brilliant!” Kate whispered to me. She was right, it<span data-page="page_3"></span> was brilliant. And that was the great thing about the house, the fact that it was so functional, so thought-through, that it seemed to be looking after you of its own accord. Also, a small but crucial detail, the Internet connections were very poor. There was broadband—I mean, it wasn’t Tora Bora—but the walls were thick and the frame of the building had a metal component, which meant that the Wi-Fi was so erratic that it was the same as not working. There was next to no 3G or mobile data. That was luxurious, too—not for the few poor souls who were forced to roam the halls looking for mobile reception, but for us. I gave up on the Wi-Fi and stopped checking my phone. It was a holiday in itself to feel so out of touch, so uncontactable.</p><p>As for the children, we could more or less leave them to it. The school holidays had been going on for two and a half weeks already, and we were drained and resourceless from endless days of full-contact parenting. Here, that wasn’t an issue. We sat with them while they ate their tea and then left them to a Disneython in the children’s TV room. Then I wrangled them off to bed, a little hyper from the excitement and novelty—I mean me as well as the children—but still manageable. I needed one of the staff to help me find our room, up two flights of stairs, down two corridors, round a corner and then back again, unexpectedly, after all that twisting and turning, at the front of the house, overlooking the drive. The kids’ very big room had a connecting door to our enormous one. We did faces and teeth, a perfunctory lullaby, I adjusted the lights so that they were low enough for Toby and high enough for Mia, and then I was back downstairs for dinner.</p><p>Conversation with this roomful of strangers was easier after the second drink. As the prune-and-Armagnac soufflé was served, Toby came down, announcing that he was worried and couldn’t sleep. He seemed more scared than usual for his mid-sleep waking, but then it was a very big, very strange, very unfamiliar house. I was perhaps too quick to think nothing of it.</p><p>I took Toby up to bed. On the way, I complimented him on having managed to find the dining room. He said that one of the other guests, the tall man we’d seen looking for a mobile-phone signal in the entrance hallway, had shown him.</p><p>“He was on his mobile the whole time,” Toby said. “It was a bit weird.”</p><p>Looking back, all I can say in my defense is that it would have been very inconvenient to pay more attention to my sudden sense of unease. Easier to keep my head down and concentrate on having a good time. I found my way to the bedrooms by turning left at a huge pot of poinsettias, and when Toby fell back onto his bed he was asleep by the second bounce.</p><p>The next day started well. The children got themselves up and, after making a determined but mercifully short attempt to get us up, too, went off in search of breakfast—did I mention that there was something called a nursery, which was a separate children’s dining room? We slept in until after nine, an extravagance of unprecedented dimensions. We were woken by the subliminal awareness that somewhere in this huge mansion somebody was cooking bacon.</p><p>There was a moment of incongruity when it turned out that, in the middle of all this lavishness, we couldn’t open the curtains. They were soft and thick and hugely heavy, but there was no obvious pulley or cord to get them apart. The very definition of a First World problem: unopenable curtains. Luckily, just as I was about to give up, Toby and Mia returned from breakfast. Toby saw what I was doing and, trying to suppress his manifest sense of triumph, pressed a little button by the side of the bed. The curtains silently glided apart and we were looking out at a vista of lawn, oaks, and cloudy sky, down the driveway on which we’d arrived the day before. The lawns were pristine and stretched into the middle distance.</p><p>“I wish you’d been good at maths instead of English,” Kate said.</p><p>“How did you know how to do that, darling?” I asked Toby. I had already noticed that one of the defining features of the house was that there were gadgets everywhere. Mostly buttons. The previous owner had evidently been button-mad. Everything from the curtains in the home cinema (oh, yes, forgot to mention, there were curtains) to the reclining mechanism on the seats in the spa (oh, yes, forgot to mention the spa) to the sliding door through to our dressing room (oh, yes, forgot to mention the dressing room) operated by buttons.</p><p>“The tall man told me,” said Toby. “He knew how it works.” Again, I felt uneasy, and again I ignored it.</p><p>At breakfast, there was that same sense of two dozen strangers thrown together by an indifferent destiny, and I had the impression that people were present who hadn’t been at dinner the night before, and vice versa. No matter: the luxury was what mattered, what counted, what felt real. Toby and Mia had already disappeared off elsewhere. People<span data-page="page_4"></span> muttered in desultory conversations and flicked through newspapers. Toward the end of the meal, Michael stood up at one end of the table and tapped a knife against a glass.</p><p>“Um,” he said. I tried not to catch Kate’s eye. “There isn’t really a plan. For the day. Sort of, um, do whatever you, um, feel like. I thought we might go sort of shooting, you know, pheasants, so I’m going to do that and any of you who’d like to, um, do that can come too, um, at eleven or so, and have some lunch and so on.”</p><p>So that’s what we did. First, I went to find our host for a quiet word, which in a house this size was not straightforward. Eventually, I was steered by one of the staff to his office. Michael was sitting at a desk with “Option Volatility &amp; Pricing” propped up in front of him, writing on a Post-it note.</p><p>“There’s no futures market for onions,” he said. “Gerald Ford had it banned when he was a congressman for Michigan. The Onion Futures Act was passed in 1958. It’s the main reason onion prices are so volatile. Are you coming shooting?”</p><p>I said that I was.</p><p>“We have to bury some of them,” he said, then, seeing that I had no idea what he was talking about, went on, “The pheasants. We shoot so many there’s just no market. A market failure of a sort. Market for shooting but not for eating. So they get buried, plowed under by a tractor. I’m trying to find a way of giving them away. Strange thought, a food you literally can’t give away. I forgot to ask: how was the trip up?”</p><p>“Fine,” I lied. Then I counted to five, a technique I often employed with Michael, since if I changed the subject too quickly it would end up taking even longer: his face would look like what a rebooting computer’s face would look like, if it had one. <em>Four . . . five.</em></p><p>“Michael,” I asked, “just wondering, who is the very tall man?”</p><p>“I thought I’d said,” Michael replied, visibly returning from his reveries about the international onion market and pheasant mass burial. “Hector. He works for me. Well, sort of. He’d probably say he works ‘with’ me. I’ve noticed that that’s a thing now, people say they work ‘with’ you, not ‘for’ you. They must think it sounds . . .” He faded out again.</p><p>“Hector,” I said.</p><p>“Oh, yes, he’s a data-mining person. Sort of, takes a haystack and digs out the needles.”</p><p>“I’d like to have a word with Hector,” I said. “Also, do you know if he has kids? I know he hasn’t got any kids here, but does he have kids in general?”</p><p>“Um . . . yes. By a previous marriage. They came on the yacht once. The ex-wife seemed to be extremely cross with him, you sort of wondered why they were married. They’re with her this Christmas. Boy and a girl.” Michael got up and came round his desk.</p><p>I felt a sense of relief. Tall Hector was missing his children, so his interest in mine could easily be explained by that, and his wandering around semi-Aspergerishly on his phone when we’d first arrived would be accounted for by the kind of work he did: he was that type of person. Still, I felt that I should meet him. Michael took me on a tour of the public rooms (sitting room, library, salon, reading room, billiard room), and then we knocked on the door of Hector’s suite, all without result.</p><p>“Probably gone for a walk. Some of them did. If he doesn’t come shooting, or we don’t bump into him in the course of things, I’ll introduce you at dinner.”</p><p>Toby and Mia didn’t want to watch grownups shoot, so Kate gave them her mobile and gave the woman in charge of the house instructions not to allow them out but to let them play video games or watch films or whatever until we got back. We headed off in a convoy of Land Rovers to an exposed patch of high ground a few miles away. I think slightly more than half our fellow-guests came. The beaters and drivers or whatever they’re called were all in place. A reassuringly huge set of picnic baskets was arranged across trestle tables. Some of the party, who had clearly been forewarned, wore spectacularly complete English shooting drag, tweed waistcoats and jackets and caps and trousers and so on. A few of us, Kate and me very much included, were in jeans and trainers. The lugubrious man in charge of the shoot did not look impressed. He held out a bag and said, “Draw a peg.” We did: I was No. 4, Kate No. 9. We set up with shotguns at our appointed spots. I introduced myself to the men on either side of me. One of them was a Hungarian former physicist who worked for Michael in some capacity that he either could not or would not explain, and who spoke what you’d have thought was an unemployably small amount of English. I don’t know who the man on the other side of me was, because he didn’t say anything. The pheasants were driven toward us, and we shot them, with varying degrees<span data-page="page_5"></span> of competence. The argumentative Frenchwoman gave a small squeak every time her shotgun went off—and hit more pheasants than anyone else. I’d done this only once before, and set myself the target of hitting a single pheasant, which eventually, some way into the second hour, I did. While we were shooting, the clouds turned dark and threatened rain, but it stayed dry.</p><p>Lunch was—perhaps a macabre touch, but I appreciated it—pheasant sandwiches. Also blinis with caviar, made to order on a spirit stove, salad of salsify and chopped egg, custard tart, Billecart-Salmon rosé. The small talk continued to be hard work, but the shooting made it easier, because if the person you were talking to was hard going you could always point at the sky, say <em>bang!</em>, mime a pheasant falling to earth, and hold up a single finger. I did this with my Hungarian physicist. He looked at me, nodded slowly, and held up four fingers. I thought, Yeah, right. After lunch, we were given new pegs and shot some more pheasants. I got another one.</p><p>Parental guilt, largely dormant while we were on the shoot, began to kick in on the way back, but, when we got to the house, a short unfrantic search found Toby and Mia parked in front of a “Star Wars” film in the TV room. In order to keep the level of digital distraction sufficiently intense, Toby had picked up an iPad—not his, a house iPad—and was playing a side game of Plants vs. Zombies.</p><p>“What did you have for lunch?” Kate asked.</p><p>“Beans,” they said in unison.</p><p>“Did you get bored?” I asked them as they sat side by side in matching reclining chairs, their legs not reaching to the end of the footrests.</p><p>“It’s ‘Star Wars,’ ” Toby said, as if to a simpleton. “We’re on the second one now.”</p><p>Kate and I exchanged a guilty look. We seemed to be doing a lot of that. We were having a good time, but it would also be possible to construct a case that we were the worst parents in the world.</p><p>“It was clever of you to get the new film and set up the screen and everything.”</p><p>“The tall man did it.”</p><p>Kate and I looked at each other and shrugged. Hector was lonely and missing his children. It made sense. But then Kate noticed something, and that was when the holiday went irrecoverably wrong.</p><p>“Your hair is wet,” she said. “You went for a swim?”</p><p>“Yup,” Toby said. “The tall man took us.”</p><p>“The tall man went swimming with you.”</p><p>“Yes. No. He didn’t get in. We went to the pool and wanted to go swimming, but there were no grownups there so we couldn’t, but then the tall man came and he let us in because he could reach the lock thing and then he waited by the side while we swam and then he went away. He was on his phone the whole time. He’s always on his phone.”</p><p>“The tall man was on his phone? Was he.” I tried to keep my voice level. “Did he look like he was filming you?”</p><p>“Maybe. I dunno. Maybe not. He kept moving his phone about. Even when we were in the changing room he was waving the phone about.”</p><p>I felt ill. I suddenly made a connection—the sight of Toby pressing the home button on the iPad was what did it.</p><p>“When the tall man told you how to make the curtains open in our bedroom, remember that? Pressing that button thingy? Did he just tell you, or did he come into the room and show you?”</p><p>I knew what Toby was going to say.</p><p>“We were looking and couldn’t find it, and he came in and showed us. He was on his phone then, too, when he came in our room. Like I said, he’s always on his phone. He never says anything, he just keeps looking at his phone.”</p><p>I knew something was wrong. I went at speed to look for Michael. I found him back in his office with his textbook. I told him we needed to find Hector, right away. He got up and came with me and we did the same circuit we had done earlier in the day. The house seemed to have refilled with guests during the afternoon, as people came back from whatever pursuits they’d been pursuing and started looking forward to dinner. Michael did a lot of smiling and nodding as we passed people in the corridors, the salon, the sitting room.</p><p>We found Hector in the library. A swarthy man with smooth dark hair was sitting in a red leather armchair with a copy of the <em>Financial Times</em> and a cup of tea. At a single glance, I could tell that he wasn’t the man we had seen in the hallway when we first arrived. “Hector!” Michael said. “Can I introduce my old friend David?”</p><p>Hector bounced to his feet. He was, at a generous estimate, five feet seven. I took his hand so distractedly I can’t have failed to seem rude. Then I said, “Excuse me” and dragged Michael out of the room.</p><p>“Michael, what the hell? I said the tall man. In fact, I said the very tall man. I was extremely specific. The whole point was how tall he is.”</p><p>Michael blinked at<span data-page="page_6"></span> me. “Hector is tall. Unusually so. He is Bolivian, and they are the second-shortest people in the world. Average male height is 1.6 metres, or five feet two. Hector is many centimetres taller than that. If he were Dutch and was that much taller than the national average he would be six feet eight. He could be a professional basketball player!”</p><p>I took a breath and wrestled for a moment with the desire to punch my close old friend in the face. <em>Three . . . four . . . five.</em></p><p>“O.K., Michael, here’s the thing. One of your guests has been behaving, let’s just use that all-purpose word ‘inappropriately’ with my children. Going into their room at night, taking them for a swim, coming into the children’s room when they’re watching a film. O.K.? That clear enough for you? The person doing that is the tall guest. The one who is genuinely tall by any sane person’s standards, not your bloody data person who could in some parallel universe be a Dutch basketball player if it weren’t for the fact that in real life he’s actually a fucking Bolivian dwarf.”</p><p>Michael was completely still, usually a sign that he was thinking hard.</p><p>“Very tall,” he said.</p><p>“Jesus, Michael? How clear do you want it to be? Yes, very tall.”</p><p>He thought a bit more.</p><p>“No,” he eventually said.</p><p>“What do you mean, no?”</p><p>“There are no guests that could be reasonably described as very tall. Taking that to mean, significantly in excess of six feet. I’m not sure that you yourself aren’t the tallest man here.”</p><p>That punch-old-friend-in-face feeling came back over me.</p><p>“Look: we saw him. When we arrived, he was right there in the hallway. In fact, we saw him before we saw you. A rude cold tall man. He went out one way just before you came in from the other side.”</p><p>“No,” Michael said again. “I’m sorry, but that doesn’t fit my recollection. You were alone when I came in—I mean, except for some of the house people who were there to show you to your room and whatnot.”</p><p>“Michael, I know social life and small talk and all that stuff aren’t really your thing, but is it possible you have somebody here you don’t know about? Somebody you accidentally invited in a casual moment and then forgot about? Copied in on an e-mail by mistake? Had a few drinks, blurted out a New Year’s invitation, and they took you up on it without your realizing?”</p><p>“No,” he said, yet again. “I’m sorry, but no. There is no possibility that there is a guest here I don’t know about.”</p><p>We both fell silent. It was easy to imagine how somebody could be moving around the house without being fully identified, since we were all essentially strangers to one another. The fact that this somebody was not a guest was what I found most disturbing. This meant that there was a man roaming around who wasn’t supposed to be here, and who was taking an unsolicited interest in a nine-year-old boy and a seven-year-old girl, especially when there were no adults around. Michael and I came to no conclusion, and I could tell he thought that we had not seen quite what I knew we’d seen when we arrived, and also that the children were exaggerating or lying or had got imaginatively stuck on an inaccurate description of somebody, probably a member of staff. To be fair to him, I might have thought the same thing, if I hadn’t seen the tall man with my own eyes.</p><p>That night was New Year’s Eve. A big evening was planned, with dinner and then a huge bonfire, where we were supposed to gather to toast the arrival of January 1st. I decided to skip all of it. After talking to Michael, I went to see Kate and we decided that it was too late to leave, but we would not let the children out of our sight for the rest of the day. Kate sat with them while they ate their supper and then went to dress for dinner while I read them a story and got them settled. Then I took up position in an armchair opposite the doorway, turned off the light, and just sat there. It felt like an expiation, a penance for I don’t quite know what. The leather chair squeaked when I moved, and the children murmured complaints for the first quarter of an hour, but once they’d fallen asleep I was free to wriggle about.</p><p>Time passed slowly. Although we were at the opposite end of the house and on the first floor, I could sense the big dinner party, the thrum and vibration of company and cooking and coming and going around a big crowded table. The bedroom was warm, and I alternated between feeling drowsy and anxiously, jerkily awake. Toby and Mia took turns muttering and shifting in their sleep. After a couple of hours, I could hear voices and movement; dinner had finished. Kate came into the room, pantomiming cat-burglarishly as she tiptoed in. She went through into our room, changed into many layers of warm clothing, came back to kiss the children once again, and headed off into Phase II of the celebrations. Noise came and went as doors opened and closed, and<span data-page="page_7"></span> there were subtle drafts as guests went through the big doors at the front of the house. Then it grew properly quiet again. I sat and fidgeted and daydreamed, never managing to be either entirely comfortable or uncomfortable. I thought about the identity of the tall man. I thought about Michael and the ways in which he had and hadn’t changed. I thought about the lectures I was giving next term, and how sick of them I was, and whether or not I could be bothered to write another course. I remembered back to the time I’d written these, in the first year of my first job, two decades ago, while Michael and I were sharing a flat, when nothing about the idea of being in my rich old friend’s huge house with my two children asleep in the room, and my wife outside at a bonfire, would have seemed in any way imaginable. I thought about the ways in which I liked my life and the ways in which I was disappointed by it.</p><p>I may have fallen asleep. I’m not sure. What happened next was in the margin between dreams and full consciousness. I knew where I was and what I was doing, but my volition seemed to have been dialled down so that I could not move or speak. I saw the handle of the door, directly across from where I was sitting, start to move. It was easy to tell, because it was an irregular wooden handle and the pattern of light shifted on it as it turned. The door began, very gradually, to open. The figure in the doorway was backlit from the light in the hall, and I couldn’t see its face, but I could see that it was a man. A tall man. Slowly and in complete silence, he came into the middle of the room. He was holding a phone in his right hand, and when he got to the middle of the room he lifted it up to his face. For the first time, I could see his eyes. In the reflected light of the phone, they were completely white. There was no pupil and no iris. I ordered myself to stand, but couldn’t. I felt as if there were nothing left of me but a compound of fear and helplessness.</p><p>The man walked across to Toby’s bed and stood over my sleeping son. He held the phone out over Toby and moved it up and down. He looked at the phone and shook his head. Then he crossed to Mia’s side of the room. He held the phone out again. There was a faint murmur, as if he was whispering to himself. He kept looking down at the children and then back at his phone. He never looked at me. After standing by Mia’s bed for what felt like a long time, he shook his head again and went back to the middle of the room. Then he bowed his head for a moment, as if in prayer or resignation, and walked out of the bedroom. The door closed smoothly and silently. There was no noise of footsteps, but there was a regular tapping noise that hadn’t been there before. It took me a few seconds to realize that it was my heartbeat, and that I was now, if I hadn’t previously been, fully awake. I got up and ran to the door and opened it. The corridor was empty. Through the window at the far end of the hallway, facing over the back of the house, I could see the distant flames of the New Year’s celebratory bonfire. I ran to the window, from which the corridor forked left and right to the two wings of the house. There was nobody to be seen.</p><p>We left before breakfast. There were no trains, so I had asked Michael’s driver, the one who’d picked us up, if he would, as a private arrangement between him and me, take us all the way home. We agreed on a rate of a pound a mile, which at the time I felt was the best two hundred and fifty pounds I would ever spend. I would have said goodbye to Michael if I had seen him, but he wasn’t up yet, so I didn’t. We carried our own bags downstairs at seven o’clock, and the driver was waiting. He helped Kate and me shove our cases into the trunk.</p><p>The car set off down the long driveway. It had been cold overnight, and a hard frost had settled on the lawns and on the gravel, so the driver went slowly. When we got a few hundred yards from the house, my phone suddenly blossomed with texts and messages and missed calls. I took it out and looked: nothing important, just the electronic detritus of modern life. The driver laughed.</p><p>“That always happens,” he said. “Used to drive the previous owner mad. Did everything he could to get reception inside, and none of it worked. He’d wander about the house, cursing the weak signal. He hated it, because he was mad about his gadgets. We used to say the two loves of his life were his gadgets and his children. And the sad thing was, that was how he died. He was driving up here, tried to send a text to say he was<span data-page="page_final"></span> running late. Texting and driving—bad combination. Car turned over, he died. When they cut him out of the car, phone was still in his hand.”</p><p>“Stop the car,” I said. We crunched to a halt. I found myself breathing heavily. I undid my seat belt and got out. The grass was stiff with frost. I leaned down to my open door and said, “The previous owner—was he a tall man?” but I didn’t wait for an answer, because I knew what it would be. I stood and turned and looked back at the house. Standing at the window of the children’s bedroom, a familiar shape appeared in silhouette. I couldn’t see him clearly, but there was a sharp flash of light, and then another, and then another. I realized that the light was coming from something in his hands, moving from side to side, catching the early-morning sun and dazzling it back at us, as he turned and moved and shifted, always moving, always adjusting, forever straining for that elusive thing, forever seeking, trapped in a moment that would never end, trying to find a signal. ♦</p>	John Lanchester	April 3, 2017 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/03/signal-john-lanchester	Children	Internet	Parenting				Unnamed	First	Children
The Abandonment	<p>When he returned to the bagel place, there was the usual line, but his hope dwindled with every face that wasn’t hers. He went around the block for the dozenth time. After that, he came untethered and wandered south.</p><p>Heedless at the corners, he was nearly hit by a cab. He turned right for no reason, and on that block, as he walked, some invisible industrial fan seemed to whir violently, sending up trash. Suddenly, before his eyes, there was an aircraft carrier.</p><p>There was motion and transition everywhere, the urgent, churning city, the cry of a siren fading around the block. At the Empire State Building, they tried to get him to take a tour.</p><p>He and his wife had married in Cuba (by way of Nicaragua) four years earlier, long before the embargo was lifted. They had thrilled to the risk, the style, of kicking off their days under staid old matrimony in such rebel fashion. There was a priest, and a punto band, and the beach, and the stars, and the northern wind, and everything about that night was emblematic of how they hoped to shape the years. Now they would divorce. Well, so what? Sooner or later, everyone got divorced.</p><p>Knowing it was useless—she was gone, gone—he threw his cell phone into a trash can. When he came to his senses and returned for it, he searched and searched, but he had the wrong street corner.</p><p>Cyclists yelled at him on the Brooklyn Bridge. He found himself gripping something with fierce resolve. Looking down, he discovered a glossy postcard advertising two-for-one drinks during happy hour at a gentlemen’s club. He tried putting it away, but there was no back pocket. He was wearing his gray linen pajama pants. What did it matter? It was over. Nothing mattered.</p><p>He had known better than to marry. He’d seen his parents hurt each other, and leave, and hurt and leave others, the casual lovers, the stepparents. But he gave it a shot anyway, and it ended pretty much as he imagined, with him wandering the streets in tears.</p><p>It was no surprise where he wound up. He hoped to find her there. How he loved her—her face, her smile. He took a deep breath and entered the lobby.</p><p>“Who is it?” she asked through an ancient intercom.</p><p>“It’s Nick,” he said, and there followed the longest pause of his life. He had second thoughts. Was he presentable enough? Could he make the right impression? Another minute went by before she buzzed him in.</p><p>The elevator, an old cat hibernating on some upper floor, rattled to life when he called it and roared down to him. The doors opened, and he stepped forward with his head down . . . and a second later stepped back with his head up, as a family of four charged out—the father first, with the stride of a bandleader, then an excitable boy in a Viking hat blasting enemies with a caulk gun, then a German shepherd, then an older brother wearing athletic knee-highs and a soccer jersey as long as a gown, followed at last by Mom, stuck, with her rumpled flannel shirt and sweatpants, in the wrong family in the wrong season, crying out for Bill to be careful with the tomatoes.</p><p>“Oh, my God,” she said, and stopped and stared. They had switched places: he was inside the elevator, and she was looking at him from the lobby. “I thought that was you.” She was gawking. She was tongue-tied. “You are just . . . <em>awesome</em>.”</p><p>“Thank you,” he said, pressing the button to hurry the door along.</p><p>“I mean it—I just <em>love</em> you.”</p><p>“Thanks.”</p><p>She finally came to her senses, and a hand shot up to her mouth. “Oh, I’m so embarrassed!” she said. The door began to close. She waved. “Bye!”</p><p>On his way up, he put the family out of mind and returned to thinking about her—her face, her smile.</p><p>He stepped off the elevator, and there she was, on the phone, propping the apartment door open. One strap of her denim overalls hung off her shoulder, and when she saw him she smiled happily. Then he neared, and her happiness faded. She palmed the mouthpiece. “Is something wrong?” she said.</p><p>“She’s gone.”</p><p>“Who’s gone?”</p><p>“My wife,” he said.</p><p>She frowned, waved him in, and hurried to get off the phone.</p><p>He moved inside, out of the way of the closing door. How many times in the past had he stood like this, on the brink, with the merciless eyes of a child? He took in the Santa Claus welcome mat many months out of season, the wicker basket against the far wall spilling over with sandals and tennis shoes, the lacquered console table on which the house keys and loose change had been tossed . . . and all the many colors, and vibes, and impressions, and the hundred other ways these perfect strangers chose to live. On, astonishingly, six other occasions, when his parents met other people, and fell in love, and married, and ordered the instant integration of two families’ lives, their laundry, and their lore (and, to often disastrous effect, their DNA)—the Morgans, followed by the Dinardos and the Teahans, on his mother’s side; the Winklows, the Andersons, and that insufferable Lee clan, on his<span data-page="page_2"></span> father’s—he had stood like this, appraising and rejecting, and wanting nothing more than to return to the bunk bed in his first room, where all the linens and the wall shadows had been under a single, steady proprietorship. For as soon as his parents were married and moved in, and all the painful adjustments were made, they were divorcing again and moving out.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” she said. “This will just take another minute.”</p><p>“Are you alone?” he asked.</p><p>She raised a finger and looked away as she wrapped things up with customer service.</p><p>A different stranger might have fled, but, as he was easy in unfamiliar surroundings—one of the virtues of his childhood—he made himself at home and casually took in the state of the apartment. It was a mess. There were toys everywhere, puzzle pieces communing with cereal flakes under the table, and a pink knit blanket on the hardwood floor which she presently swooped down on with furious efficiency (pocketing the cell phone at last) and folded as they approached the door leading into the next room.</p><p>“I can’t believe it,” she was saying. “It’s really you!”</p><p>“It’s really me,” he said. “Were you painting?”</p><p>“Oh, trying to.” She put her finger to her lips. “We have to go through the baby’s room to get to the living room,” she whispered. “It’s the crazy way this apartment was designed. Try not to wake her!”</p><p>More family clutter awaited them in the living room. The table lamp was on in daylight, and there were cups on top of coasters. Wheeled toys on leads had been dropped mid-pull. A box of crayons had fallen in front of the sofa and fanned out around a carton of dried-out diaper wipes. She hurried to clear a spot for him, heaping stray items on top of a toy bin. He sat down and came up holding a yo-yo. She plucked it from his hand and, before sitting down next to him, gave it an underhand toss and hit the top of a beanbag.</p><p>“So what happened?” she asked.</p><p>“She went out this morning for bagels,” he said. “We have this routine on Sunday mornings—one of us runs out for bagels and the newspaper, and we spend the morning in bed.”</p><p>“Oh, my God,” she said. “People still do that?”</p><p>“But she never came home. I called and I called. She never picked up. She didn’t reply to my texts. I waited—I thought maybe she was taking a walk, you know, to clear her head, or whatever. But I don’t think so.”</p><p>“Did you guys have a fight or something?”</p><p>“This has been a long time coming,” he said.</p><p>“I’m sorry to hear that,” she said. “Marriage is so hard.”</p><p>“And, who knows, maybe she <em>is</em> out on a walk.”</p><p>“How long has it been?”</p><p>“Four hours?” he said. “Maybe five?”</p><p>“That’s kind of a long walk,” she said.</p><p>He had met her at the Arts Fund annual gala, in a d.j.’d ballroom in the Paramount hotel, in midtown. Two grown women in diapers and pigtails were led around the crowd on a single leash before dinner, and men in mascara shook hands with spiky rings on all ten fingers. They were seated next to each other at a table that included Stephanie Savage and Ryan McGinley. She was Calarusso’s sometime assistant, there that night to see that the great man ate his soup. During appetizers, Nick learned that she painted in her spare time. By dessert, she was showing him thumbnails of her most recent work and promising to watch his series (if she could find the time to stream it on Netflix). It was not one of the shows that her friends were always telling her she just had to watch.</p><p>After the thanks were doled out and the speeches concluded, Calarusso demanded to go home, and she went off to find him a car. The enormous painter, to whom Nick had not been introduced, turned to him and said, with tasteless relish, “The poor girl. She’s about to burn her life to the ground and she doesn’t even know it.”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>Calarusso’s eyes got wider and gleamed with mischief. “The husband’s grown fat.”</p><p>An hour later, with Calarusso gone, she suddenly confessed that it had been a little more than a million years since she was last out of the house, and she had overdone it. She had had too much to drink and needed to get home.</p><p>“Let me drop you off,” he said.</p><p>“No, it’s O.K. I can take the subway.”</p><p>“Don’t be silly,” he said. “I have a car waiting outside.”</p><p>He had hoped that they would continue their conversation, but she fell asleep and slept straight through the sudden stops, the thundering starts, the potholes exploding beneath them like mortar bombs. Waiting for her at home, he imagined, was everything anyone could ever want, and she no longer saw much appeal in a stranger. She was above that now. He admired her for it. Her only vice these days? Stolen sleep.</p><p>When the car pulled up to her building, he woke her gently, and she opened her eyes and took a deep breath. For a split second, she probably wondered where on earth she was and how she had got there.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” she said. “How long have I been asleep?”</p><p>“Since midtown, more<span data-page="page_3"></span> or less.”</p><p>“Oh, I’m so sorry.”</p><p>“Don’t be,” he said.</p><p>“Thank you,” she said. “You’re very sweet.”</p><p>She said good night and stepped out of the car. That was four days ago.</p><p>“I knew it was coming,” he said to her now. “I predicted it: eventually, she would leave me. She had to. Day to day, things were just too . . . too . . . ”</p><p>“What? Awful?”</p><p>“Do you know what she does?” he asked incredulously. “First of all, there are flowers. She brings flowers into the house, just to have them around. Then, when they die, instead of just tossing them, she hangs them up to dry and then takes the petals off and puts the petals in these Japanese bowls and then places the bowls here and there around the house.”</p><p>She waited.</p><p>“Who does that?” he asked her.</p><p>She laughed in agreement. “I don’t know,” she said. “I take it you guys don’t have kids!”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Nobody’s drying flowers around here,” she said. “Dried flowers wouldn’t make it past breakfast.”</p><p>“And then she makes everything smell nice. There are pleasant little pockets everywhere you go. A little pocket of lemon here in the foyer. A little sachet of lavender near the bathtub. A little candle of verbena in the kitchen. Do you know what that’s like?”</p><p>“We have pockets like that around here,” she said, “but of rotten milk and urine, usually.” She laughed.</p><p>“I love your apartment,” he said.</p><p>She looked around, mock startled. “<em>Why</em>?” she asked. She laughed again. “No, it is a nice apartment. It’s just too small for us. But rent is so crazy.”</p><p>“I love how lived-in it is.”</p><p>“Oh, it’s lived-in, all right. Sometimes it feels like Homer and Langley decided to have children.” She picked up a squeeze toy—for a child? a pet?—and made it squeak before tossing it after the yo-yo.</p><p>“This is also where you work?”</p><p>“Every free minute of every day,” she replied.</p><p>“You’re very driven.”</p><p>“No,” she said. “Just terrified.”</p><p>“Of what?”</p><p>“Of never finishing another painting. Of losing myself to motherhood. Of going completely out of my fucking mind.”</p><p>“I’m so sorry to barge in on you like this,” he said. “You’re probably trying to get some work done while the baby naps, and here I show up without even calling.”</p><p>“Please,” she said. “I’m happy to see you.”</p><p>“You have a nice home,” he said. “So full of life. Nothing at all like my apartment.”</p><p>“Where it’s clean, you mean? And everything smells nice? And it’s quiet? And you can hear yourself think?”</p><p>She laughed at herself, or perhaps for his sake, to reassure him, but the mirth drained from her face soon enough, and then she looked around again at the disarray.</p><p>“From the outside,” she said, “it must look like a pretty good life, like a fulfilled life—which it is. But, when you’re plunked down in the middle of it, sometimes it just feels like time fleeing.”</p><p>“I love you,” he said.</p><p>She pulled back. “Pardon?”</p><p>“No, just this life, I mean. Your apartment. The mess, even. I love the . . . I really love rooms like this one, where you can practically hear the children playing, and the washing machine going, and you can smell the banana bread baking in the oven. You really feel the love in this room, that’s all I meant. You and your husband have three kids, is that right?”</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>“Where is he now?”</p><p>But she had gone silent.</p><p>She was the real thing. He could not simply say “I love you” and look at her until she melted. Calarusso was wrong. She had resolve, and self-respect. She would not just run off with the latest man who flattered her, as his mother had done, or tape the children up for transport in a used box, to test the advantages of a different address.</p><p>“Listen, I’m sorry,” he said. “I didn’t mean to give you the wrong impression. Naomi—that’s my wife—she’s not some insane person who needs to have everything perfectly in place all the time. Our apartment gets plenty messy. But let me tell you something she does do without fail every day. She makes the bed. Now, I wasn’t taught to make the bed every day. Some of my stepparents hated that about me, and I didn’t make the bed on purpose half the time just to get back at them. But then I got married, and, for some reason, I’d look at the bed Naomi had made and I’d see, you know, not kindness, not . . . whatever. I’d see spite! I’d think she’d made the bed deliberately to criticize me, or to prove how much more considerate she was than me, or some other stupid thing, and I resented her for it. For making the bed! We’d get into these fights, I’d bring up the bed, she’d look at me, like, What are you talking about? What does making the bed have to do with anything? And then, one day, it just dawned on me. She’s not making the bed to get back at me. She’s making the bed because she likes a made bed. She wants our lives, our shared life together, to be pleasant. I had never thought about that before, the fact that I had a shared life.”</p><p>“You<span data-page="page_4"></span> should have kids,” she said. “Then you know it’s shared.”</p><p>“I was telling you about how my apartment smells good,” he said. “Well, when I was a kid, right, and into my teens, and into my twenties, even, I was surrounded—this will sound weird, now that I’m about to say it out loud—by all of these strange people’s smells, the different odors of different families. I mean the soaps they had in their bathrooms. Their coat closets, their family recipes. The breath their sofas let out when you sat down on them. And then the grosser things—how they left the bathroom, what they gave off when you got too close. It wasn’t always repugnant, just foreign, and I didn’t want the foreign. I wanted the familiar. That’s what family is: what’s familiar. And every new house I went to, every new family I joined, they had all these scents that weren’t familiar. I could no longer say what would have been familiar. I just knew that it was nowhere present in those houses. So, when Naomi and I got married, and I had to adjust to a whole new set of scents—and, you know, <em>things</em>, possessions, wall hangings, whatever—I was just, like, no. What was the point of being married if I just had to keep adjusting? I wouldn’t do it, I refused. In my head, I mean. Those were Naomi’s things, not mine. What was mine? I had no idea, really. I just knew, in my head, I would not give in. So we fought. We fought like cats and dogs. Until one day I realized that her scents had <em>become</em> my scents. They were <em>my</em> scents. This was my life. Why was I sabotaging it? I finally knew what was mine.”</p><p>He stopped talking. She narrowed her eyes and looked at him intently. “Huh,” she said. Something in his monologue had provoked her. She looked away. She even stood up, crossed her arms, and started to pace back and forth. She seemed to have forgotten entirely about his blurting out that he loved her. She came to a stop and said, “It’s the exact opposite with me.”</p><p>“How so?”</p><p>“Well, I used to have my own odors—that’s a funny way of putting it. You know what I mean. My own life. But it’s the kids’ life now, it’s the kids’ odors. They’ve blotted everything else out. God only knows what I smell like now.” He expected her to laugh, but she didn’t. It wasn’t meant to be a joke. “Do you know how hard it is some days just to find time to take a shower and put on lotion? Will I ever take a bath again? I don’t know. Will I ever smell of perfume again? Will I ever paint something that’s worth a damn?”</p><p>“What does your husband say?” he asked.</p><p>“About what?”</p><p>He wasn’t sure, and shrugged. “Your painting. Your desire to take a bath.”</p><p>“He and I have our ups and downs,” she said. “Like any couple.”</p><p>Returning to the sofa, she folded the white onesie that had suddenly appeared in her hands, setting it down absent-mindedly on a pile of children’s books. “Anyway,” she said.</p><p>“It’s worse now,” he said. “I might have been better off never figuring it out.”</p><p>“Figuring what out?”</p><p>“What’s mine.”</p><p>“That’s worse than not knowing?”</p><p>“Perfect terror,” he said.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Because now I know what there is to lose.”</p><p>He had returned to the fact of Naomi’s abandonment and all the loss he had suffered when she hadn’t come back to the apartment that morning.</p><p>“It’s more than just a made bed,” he said. “We talked, the two of us. We shared things. No one in my family ever talked. They shouted, they slammed doors, and then they filed for divorce. My mother had one of her wedding receptions in a McDonald’s. That’s how casual these things were. But Naomi and me, we made dinner together every night I wasn’t on set. We planned things. We did things.”</p><p>“And now that’s over?”</p><p>“Over completely.”</p><p>“But you loved her.”</p><p>“I did, yes, very much. I never used to live for my life. I lived to prove something, and to get revenge. But my life was a small, mean thing. Then, somewhere along the way, it became everything. That was terrifying.”</p><p>“But beautiful, too,” she said, fingering her wedding ring. “Not sure I do that.”</p><p>“You don’t live for your life?”</p><p>“I don’t know what I live for,” she said. “I live to neglect the other half of things.”</p><p>“What’s the other half of things?”</p><p>“Well, for instance. When I’m painting, I’m not taking care of my kids. And when I’m taking care of my kids I’m not painting. That pretty much guarantees that I don’t do either very well, and every night I sort of hate myself for it.”</p><p>“And your husband?” he said. “What do you neglect when you’re with him?”</p><p>“Calarusso, for one,” she said. “And other things. Friends. Museums. Life.” She laughed.</p><p>“He doesn’t like museums?”</p><p>“It isn’t that he doesn’t like them,” she said. “It’s that we never go to them. If we do anything together, it’s watch TV. You probably don’t watch TV, do you? Oh, that’s a stupid question—you’re <em>on</em> TV. But you know what I mean. With your wife. When you’re both tired. As the thing two people do. To be together.”<span data-page="page_5"></span></p><p>“I know what you mean,” he said. “But, no, Naomi preferred to do other things. Dinners, plays. She was with me on Corsica last year when I was filming this absolutely terrible independent movie, and I remember we got out of the car and walked down these ancient crumbling stairs to the beach, and we had this long swim, but when we came back the car was surrounded by all of these wild boars. Rutting like crazy—it was really funny. But scary, too, you know? This man from Marseille began honking his horn and somehow led them away. We’d still be there to this day if it weren’t for him.”</p><p>She didn’t seem to know how to respond to this story. “Sounds romantic,” she said.</p><p>“Romantic?”</p><p>“I just mean Corsica.”</p><p>“Oh, I guess it was,” he said. “But, you know, looking back, it wasn’t the travel we did. It was the fact that we were <em>polite</em> to each other. Where I come from, no one was ever polite. If I’m being honest, she taught me how to live.”</p><p>“This is a <em>mortal</em> woman we’re talking about, right?”</p><p>He laughed. “Oh, look,” he said. “She had her flaws, trust me.”</p><p>“Like?”</p><p>He gave the question some thought. “She doesn’t have nearly the sense of humor you do,” he said. “Or the richness.”</p><p>“Richness?”</p><p>He didn’t know how to answer, and the question hung in the air. She got to her feet again, walked to the middle of the room, and with her back to him stood thinking.</p><p>“She sounds amazing,” she said at last, “and you should fight for her. Wherever she is, find her and fight for her. For your sake.”</p><p>“But it’s too late,” he said. “We exhausted something, working through it. You try to make it work, but something gets ruined along the way. I tried her patience too many times. There’s nothing I could say now, and nothing I could do.”</p><p>“You have to beg her. You have to vow to change, and then change.”</p><p>“I have changed. Completely. She just doesn’t see it. To her, I’ll always be that bratty kid who couldn’t bring himself to make the necessary adjustments. Do you know how easy it is to get pigeonholed by the person you’re married to, and then you just can’t get out of it?”</p><p>“Oh, God, yes,” she said.</p><p>“That doomed us. We were always going to be the same people to each other, no matter how much we changed.” He gestured around the apartment. “I never considered her capable of any of this, for instance.”</p><p>“Any of what?” she asked. “The mess? The madness?”</p><p>“No, no,” he said. “The . . . the nurture. The wholeness of your lives. How there’s goodness behind every little thing in sight. Your husband must feel the same way.”</p><p>“Oh, sure,” she said. “He can’t shut up about it. He’s always romancing me for everything he finds on the living-room floor. Are you kidding me?”</p><p>“The minute I walked in,” he said, “I thought, Here is how life is best lived. Everywhere you look, there’s a sign of life. And you created it. It’s amazing. It’s like . . . like a garden in here. No, hear me out,” he said, when she had raised her eyebrows skeptically. “And what you are growing, here, and there, and over there, are little moments, and the little moments make your memories, and the memories make a life that can’t be taken away from you by anyone or anything, not other people’s fickleness, not even death. In the long run, you know, that’s better than bowls of dried flowers, or whatever.”</p><p>“I don’t know,” she said. “I’m pretty intrigued by those bowls.”</p><p>When he had finished, she came back to the sofa, curled one leg under her and sat down, looking at him with (he thought) a sexy pucker to her mouth, eyes narrowed, and held his gaze a beat longer than was strictly necessary.</p><p>“And what about love?” she asked.</p><p>“Love is everywhere in this house,” he said. “Everywhere.”</p><p>“I don’t mean that kind of love,” she said. “Don’t be seduced by the children’s toys.”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“What do you mean, what do I mean? I mean love. I mean . . . what <em>do</em> I mean? O.K., it’s like this,” she said. “Do you see that toy over there? It’s some kind of caped lion. But also a digital clock. I’m not really sure what the hell it is, to be honest. But when Micah—that’s my oldest—when Micah first got that caped lion-clock thing, it was everything to him. I mean, it was the most precious thing on earth. He went around all day hugging it to his chest. But now he never plays with it. Ever. You know what he plays with?”</p><p>She plucked off the floor a spent roll of toilet paper with a twisted rubber band taped to it. “This.”</p><p>She waggled the toilet roll, and the strap of her overalls fell off her shoulder again.</p><p>“And that’s what my husband has become, to me, and what I have become to my husband. He and I both remember, sort of, way back before kids, that we had something, but in all honesty now, after the kids go to bed, we go right back to playing with our toilet rolls. Oh,<span data-page="page_6"></span> my God,” she said. “I can’t believe that just came out of my mouth.”</p><p>“And what is your husband’s toilet roll?”</p><p>“His iPhone,” she said without hesitation.</p><p>“And yours?”</p><p>“Whatever I’m painting at the moment,” she said. “You worry about losing everything. I worry about wanting to hold on to it. Some days, I just don’t want to hold on to it.”</p><p>“You’re unhappy,” he said.</p><p>She was forced to look away, but turned back quickly and looked at him as if she were seeing him there for the first time. “How did you get in here?” she asked him, smiling. “Did I let you in?” He remained still, staring at her with his chin lowered, a faint smile curling the ends of his mouth. “It must be those eyes,” she said more quietly than before. “Those eyes are hard to say no to.”</p><p>So she was susceptible, after all. She had not fallen asleep on their ride to Brooklyn because she was above it all. She was not what the state of her apartment had suggested: a mother through and through. Calarusso had not been wrong.</p><p>His disappointment in her was sharp but brief, and bound up with excitement. He reached across the sofa and slowly lifted the denim strap to her shoulder. “Maybe I should be going,” he whispered.</p><p>She nodded. “Maybe you should.”</p><p>Neither of them moved.</p><p>“I can’t seem to bring myself to.”</p><p>“Seems you can’t.”</p><p>“The truth is, I want to stay.”</p><p>“Why?” she whispered. “Is it all the sippy cups?”</p><p>He smiled. “No.”</p><p>“The wide selection of Little Golden Books?”</p><p>“It’s you,” he said. “It’s this. It’s all of this.”</p><p>“I’m flattered.”</p><p>“I’m serious.”</p><p>“But you’re still in love with your wife,” she said. “Aren’t you?”</p><p>He would always love her, he admitted. But it had been so much worse in days past, when he drifted, crying, down dead industrial blocks, and strangers removed their earbuds to ask him if he was all right. Oh, yes, it had been much worse. This morning was an afterthought, a fainthearted performance, the death rattle, and, when he came to his senses, what had he done? He had walked straight over the bridge to her.</p><p>“This is the life I want!” he said. “I want you!”</p><p>“Are you sure it’s me,” she asked, “and not some fantasy you’ve constructed around my life?”</p><p>Then he told her that there was a woman who kept recurring in his dreams. “She shows up every few months, always while I’m in transit. I’m on a boat, or an airplane, and she just happens to be seated next to me. We talk, and then she looks at me, and I wake up. I’m always sad to wake up. I’ve had this dream for twenty-five years, ever since I was a kid, and I’ve always just believed that she was a figment of my imagination. Until I sat down next to you at dinner four nights ago.”</p><p>“We weren’t in transit.”</p><p>“I drove you home.”</p><p>“Does that count?”</p><p>“I’m counting it. And do you remember the name of the painting Calarusso auctioned that night?”</p><p>“ ‘Across the Waters to Saint-Tropez.’ ”</p><p>“While we were on the bridge, a favorite song of mine came on the radio. An old song called ‘San Tropez.’ ”</p><p>“Hey, I know that song,” she said. She sang the first two lines. “That one?”</p><p>“ ‘And you’re leading me down to the place by the sea,’ ” he sang. “That’s the one.”</p><p>They shared another look, and then she kissed him. After the first few tentative kisses, she crossed a leg over his lap and straddled him.</p><p>When they broke off, she looked at him from only a few inches away.</p><p>“Oh, my God,” she said. And she suddenly threw her head back and laughed. “This isn’t happening.”</p><p>“Yes,” he said. “It is.”</p><p>They kissed again, and afterward began a series of goodbyes, for her husband would be home from the park soon with the boys and the dog in tow, and everyone would be hot and cranky and in need of a snack, and it would be better, she said to him, thinking vaguely of the future, that he not be seen, not known, yet. They had every intention of getting up from the sofa but remained there, kissing more freely now, and between kisses he shared with her more of his childhood, and recommended that no one act rashly, for the sake of the children.</p><p>“No, yeah, of course. No one’s going to . . . no one’s doing anything stupid,” she said. “But, listen . . . ”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Well, I don’t know,” she said. “I just . . . I just know that I have to paint, that’s all.”</p><p>“Of course you do,” he said. “Always. We’ll make sure of it.”</p><p>Another ten minutes passed, and now it was imperative that she send him on his way. But they stole another minute, and when they left off kissing again she backtracked, saying it could never work out between them, because he was used to an apartment that smelled nice, where you could read the paper on a Sunday morning, and not a pigsty, where toys were scattered everywhere.</p><p>“But I can’t live like that anymore,” he said. “It’s too precious. I need a good mess.”</p><p>“That’s too bad,” she said, “because I wouldn’t mind a<span data-page="page_7"></span> little verbena in my life.”</p><p>“Oh, well, that I can do,” he said.</p><p>Then it was time, they <em>had</em> to get up, and four daring and exquisite minutes later they did. Holding hands this time, they returned through the baby’s room to the front door. The baby stirred, then let out a cry—and then it didn’t matter how carefully she shut the door behind her. Nap time was over. “Shit,” she said.</p><p>“Go,” he said. “Take care of him. I’ll see myself out.”</p><p>“It’s a her,” she said, and they kissed a final time. He was halfway out the door when she called him back and hurried across the room.</p><p>“Maybe I should just tell him,” she said.</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>“My husband,” she said. “Doesn’t he deserve to know?”</p><p>“What would you tell him?”</p><p>She thought about it. “I don’t know,” she said, and caught herself. “What’s even happening?!”</p><p>“Nothing,” he said. “And everything. Maybe you should. I don’t know—whatever you think is best.”</p><p>She leaned into him to steal one final kiss. Then he left the apartment and walked toward the elevator, which disgorged an unhappy man, two hot and sullen boys, and a Jack Russell terrier panting from the heat.</p><p>He had arrived there in the depths of despair, but was leaving now wordless with joy. At the station, he had to jump the turnstile. Bystanders wondered what luck had made his day, even if he might begin to talk to himself and laugh out loud and scare them right off the train. He was, after all, wearing pajama bottoms. Looking down at them, he was suddenly worried that, the farther away he got, the more she would wonder what on earth had possessed her to kiss a man who had showed up out of the blue in his pajamas. He would have liked to text her, or even call her, for some reassurance—and to recapitulate every sentiment of the past hour and then, as the conversation meandered, to exchange the bolder impressions that each must have of the other, which could come spilling out now that they had broken through to a new level of intimacy. Ah, what happiness! To have found her at last, someone who would never leave. But he couldn’t text or call, because he had thrown away his phone.</p><p>The doorman loaned him a spare key, but it must not have been the right one or something, because, though it slid inside the lock just fine, it wouldn’t turn. He was about to give up when he heard footsteps, and a few seconds later the door opened from the inside. Surprised, he stood up straight.</p><p>“Oh,” he said. “You’re home.”</p><p>She turned on high-arched feet and padded away soundlessly, disappearing into the bedroom. He stood there a minute with the door open, feeling the cool settled calm of the rooms filling up with dusk. He turned back to the door and shut it. He stood there a minute longer. Finally, he shuffled across the apartment and stood on the brink of the bedroom, looking in. She was packing an overnight bag that lay open on the bed.</p><p>“You thought I had left,” she said.</p><p>He nodded, looking sheepish.</p><p>“But you see now I didn’t.” She dropped a camisole on the bed and held up her arms. “How many times, Nick?”</p><p>“I really did think you were gone this time,” he said.</p><p>“I don’t doubt that,” she said. She turned to the dresser, but only to stand there at an open drawer, stirring things around uncertainly.</p><p>“You’re not leaving now, are you?”</p><p>“What choice do I have? We’ve talked about this and talked about it,” she said, sounding tired. “I thought we were making progress.”</p><p>“We were,” he said. “We are.”</p><p>“And your cell phone?”</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>“You call that progress?”</p><p>She shook her head. “I ran into Trish at the bagel place,” she explained. “Charles is going back to Texas. No one will say a word to Marie about the baby. And then she tells me that she and Teddy are getting married and she wants me to be her maid of honor. Before I know it, we’re in that little bridal shop around the corner. I just lost track of time. That’s it, Nick. That’s all.”</p><p>“I tried to call you.”</p><p>“My phone was here!”</p><p>“I kept texting you.”</p><p>“I was just running out for bagels!”</p><p>Exasperated, she sat down on the bed. Feeling stupid, he drifted away.</p><p>Not long after, from the guest bedroom, he saw the light go on in the kitchen. He heard her taking things down from the shelves. The refrigerator door opened and closed. A minute later, she began to chop. When something hit the pan and sizzled—he pictured her running her finger down the length of the blade, sliding the garlic into the hot oil—he was reminded of what, in fact, was best in life. It was Naomi’s garlic crackling, the smell filling the apartment, and the bottle of wine she would open. That beat all else, the garlic and the wine, hands down. Could she blame him for going out of his mind at the thought of it ending?</p><p>He walked to the kitchen and stood in the doorway gloomily and waited for her to speak.</p><p>“Who was it this time?” she asked finally, without looking up.</p><p>He shrugged. “Someone I met at<span data-page="page_final"></span> the gala.”</p><p>She lifted her head. To look at him, she had to move the hair out of her eyes, which she did awkwardly, with the wrist of the hand holding the knife. “You just abandon me, Nick,” she said. “I never know where you’ve gone.”</p><p>“I never really go anywhere,” he said.</p><p>“You drive me so crazy,” she said.</p><p>But she sighed, and the fight seemed to leave her body. Still shaking her head in dismay, she allowed a little smile. Without another word, he stepped into the kitchen and pulled down his own knife and took up an onion. He chopped diligently, he chopped for his life, and by the time dinner was ready all had been forgiven. ♦</p>	Joshua Ferris	August 1, 2016 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/08/01/the-abandonment-by-joshua-ferris	Actors	Bohemians	Books	Children	Love Affairs	Marriage	Nick	Third	Children
The Casserole	<p>We <span data-page="page_1"></span>waited under the cottonwoods for the ferry to come back across the Missouri River. But the heat still throbbed from the metal of our car, and it turned out to be better to stand close to the water. The river seemed so big, its incongruous whisper belying its steady speed. Clouds of swallows chased insects over the water, and doves rested in the shadows. My wife kept touching her forehead with a Kleenex and staring across at the ferry, as if to hurry its return. We could see the ferryman chatting with his passengers, which only increased her agitation. We were heading from our home in Livingston to Ellie’s family ranch to celebrate our twenty-fifth wedding anniversary. Twenty-five years and no children: her parents had stopped interrogating us about that. They assumed that it was a physical problem that some clinic could solve, but we didn’t want children. We lacked the courage to tell them that. We both liked children; we just didn’t want any ourselves. There were children everywhere, and we saw no reason to start our own brand. Young couples plunge into parenthood and about half the time they end up with some ghastly problem on their hands. We thought we’d leave that to others. But my in-laws were elderly and they had the usual views of hereditary landowners: they longed for an heir. They had acquired their land from my wife’s grandfather and, with it, a belief in family values that did not stand up to scrutiny, since most ranches these days were the scene of bitter inheritance battles. But even if my wife had had siblings she would not have been part of this sort of trouble, as she had never—at least, not since adolescence—wanted to pursue ranch life, rural life, agricultural life. She would have said to a sibling, “Take it! It’s all yours. I’m out of here.” There would have been an element of posturing in this, because she was very attached to the land; she just didn’t want to own it or do anything with it. Neither did I.</p><p>The thing was that we were quite poor. We were both grade-school teachers, and owning a house had been the extent of our indulgences. We loved our house and our work and were suitably grateful for both, though Ellie felt that if I hadn’t been so hellbent on retiring the mortgage we might have done a few more things for fun. My in-laws couldn’t believe that we had no interest in owning a ranch that was worth millions. But they wouldn’t have allowed us to sell it. We’d be stuck with it if we went along with them, which we weren’t about to do, and so now <em>they</em> were stuck with it: cows, farming equipment, fences—the whole enchilada. And they were getting old. The ranch was going to eat them alive, and they knew it. The fences would fall down; the cows would get out; the neighbors, old friends, would start to think of them as a problem. Once across this river, we’d be heading for a very sad story.</p><p>Well, not that sad. They’d had their day and it was almost over. That’s how it is for everybody. They liked to be seen as heroic strivers, alone on the unforgiving prairie, but they could have handed the ranch over, no strings attached, and headed for Arizona; after the sale, there would have been plenty for everybody. I had an extensive collection of West Coast jazz records, including the usual suspects, Gerry Mulligan, Chet Baker, Stan Getz, and so on—not everybody has Wardell Gray and Buddy Collette, but I did—and if I’d had a bit more dough I could have added a room on to our house specifically to house this collection, with an appropriate sound system. But when I complained about things like this to Ellie, she just said, “Cue the violins.”</p><p>It looked as though our appallingly high-mileage compact car was going to be the only one going on the ferry. My wife and I sat in the front, while the back seat was filled with her belongings, as was the trunk. I had no idea why she’d felt called upon to bring this exalted volume of luggage, unless it was to store things on the ranch that were cluttering up our little house. I could have asked, but I just didn’t feel like it.</p><p>“I think he’s turning around,” Ellie said, and I came out of my trance. The cable groaned next to us, and, across the river, I could see the ferry finally moving our way. Ellie was looking forward to this visit. I certainly was not. The ranch was where she had grown up, a nature lover. Despite all its deficiencies, it was her place on earth. [cartoon id="a16838"]</p><p>We watched the ferry tack across the Missouri, tugging at an angle to the cable, then landing with a broad thump on the ramp. The ferryman, who was far too young for the wide red suspenders he affected, motioned us forward, and I drove our piece-of-shit car onto the dock.</p><p>While we crossed, my wife stood on the ferry deck, looking out at the river, smiling and sighing at the swallows circling the current. I told her that they were just after the bugs. She said she understood that, but they looked beautiful <em>whatever</em> they were doing, all<span data-page="page_final"></span> right? I’ve long had trouble with people picking out some detail of the landscape and pretending it’s the whole story, as though, in this case, the blue light around those speeding birds could do anything to mask the desolation of the country north of the river, a land I traverse holding my nose.</p><p>“Aren’t you going to get out of the car?” she asked.</p><p>“Who’s supposed to drive it off the ferry?”</p><p>I looked away from my wife and turned on the radio: no signal. I thought about her peculiar cheer today. I supposed it was the prospect of seeing her mother and father, of revisiting the scenes of her childhood, which she had done often enough to prove the utter heroism of my patience. Though, in recent times, we had talked less and less, which begged the question: what was there to talk about? We worked and we saved. We saved quite a bit more than Ellie would have, had she been in charge of things. What was becoming a comfortable nest egg would have disappeared in jaunts to Belize or some other place, where Ellie could show more of the body she was so proud of to anyone and everyone. She once had the nerve to point out that all this saving up for old age was remarkable for someone who had so much contempt for the elderly. I said, “Ha-ha-ha.” She was going to have to settle for wiggling her butt in the school corridors until the inevitable day when the damn thing sagged.</p><p>At last we landed, and I drove off. Ellie was having a lively chat with the ferryman, and she took her time getting back in the car. I stared straight through the windshield until she got around to it. When she climbed in, with a sort of bounce, she exclaimed, “He grew up on the neighbor’s place, the Showalters’. He’s a Showalter. Graduated from Winnett, where I went.”</p><p>“Ah, so.”</p><p>The ranch was no more than half an hour from the ferry. Ellie’s excitement grew along the route. Here is a sampler of her exclamations:</p><p><strong>·</strong> “Look at all the antelope! There must be a hundred of them!”</p><p><strong>·</strong> “Oh, I can smell the sage now!”</p><p><strong>·</strong> “This road looks like a silver ribbon!”</p><p><strong>·</strong> “Those are all redtail hawks, just riding that thermal!”</p><p><strong>·</strong> “Larkspur!”</p><p><strong>·</strong> “What a grass year! Can you imagine what Dad’s calves will look like?”</p><p>To this last, I said, “No.” I honestly thought she was getting manic as we approached the ranch. Ellie is an enthusiast, but this went well beyond her usual behavior. I don’t know if she detected my concern, but she seemed to catch herself and clam up; she was talking less, but I could still feel her glee from my position at the wheel. I wondered if the situation called for a pill.</p><p>I drove under the ranch gate, with its iron brand hanging overhead—two inverted “V”s, known in the graceful local vernacular as “the squaw tits.” Dad, as I had long felt obliged to call him, and his wife, Mom, stood at the edge of the yard, framed from behind by their bitter little clapboard house. Dad was in full regalia: Stetson hat, leather vest, cowboy boots, and—this was new—a six-gun. Mom was dressed more conventionally, except for the lace-up boots with her wash dress and the lunch pail she was holding. Believe me, it was Methuselah and his bride at the Grand Ole Opry.</p><p>There was something about their expressions that I didn’t like. It was my turn to keep busy, as I tried to elicit signs of life from this tableau, which now included my sombre wife. Dad helped me unload Ellie’s considerable luggage, and, once it was all out on the ground, Mom handed me the lunch pail. “What’s this?” I asked.</p><p>“Something to eat on the way home. A casserole.”</p><p>I turned to Ellie. Tears filled her eyes. I felt that this could have been handled in another way—without Dad’s hand on the gun, and so forth. I think, at times like this, your first concern is to hang on to a shred of dignity. If I had a leg to stand on, it was that Ellie was upset and I was not. What kind of idiot puts a casserole in a lunch pail?</p><p>After I got back on the ferry, the thought that I was headed . . . home—well, I was not entirely comfortable with this thought, and I didn’t enjoy the ferryman staring at me, either, or asking if someone had shot my dog. I just stared out at the river, hardly a ripple in it, and miles to go before the next bend. ♦</p>	Thomas McGuane	September 10, 2012 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/09/10/the-casserole	Anniversaries	Childhood	Children	Ferries	Marriage	Missouri	Unnamed	First	Children
The Driver	<p>Mrs. <span data-page="page_1"></span>Quantrill lived in a beautiful old Prairie-style house built in the twenties, which she had restored to its original elegance with Mr. Quantrill, a patent attorney attached to Montana’s burgeoning natural-gas industry. Mrs. Quantrill had raised all kinds of hell getting the house listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The Quantrills were known for their philanthropy and for elegant parties, featuring such high jinks as horses in the living room and mock gunfights on the lawn. Hereditary landowners who no longer lived on their land, they plied it for energy leases. They hung on to their cattle brands long after the last cow had gone down the road, beautiful single-iron brands from territorial days. When their son, Spencer, inherited the house many years later, he demolished it and replaced it with storage units. Even these fell into disrepair, and it was hard to know if they produced any income, because Spencer, who’d temporarily lived in one of the units, had long since moved away.</p><p>Such was Mrs. Quantrill’s standing that her appearance in the grade-school principal’s office, with the then nine-year-old Spencer in tow, required a bit of fanfare, which she provided by doffing her coat and abruptly removing her lovely gloves a finger at a time. Back then, before such people concealed their prominence, it was not unusual to dress up even for small occasions such as this one. Mrs. Quantrill was the tallest person in the room and very thin, with unblinking blue eyes. Spencer hovered beside her as Mr. Cooper, the principal, in a tan suit and referee’s whistle, directed them to two chairs, then sidled behind his desk and sat down, fingers laced under his chin.</p><p>“Hi, Spencer.”</p><p>“Hi.”</p><p>“Thank you for coming, Mrs. Quantrill. Spencer’s struggling. Aren’t you, Spencer?”</p><p>“I guess so.”</p><p>Spencer sat with his tennis shoes one atop the other and pushed his hair across his forehead. He seemed not to know what to do with his feet, his eyes, or his hands.</p><p>“Struggling how?” Mrs. Quantrill asked sharply.</p><p>“You describe it, Spencer.”</p><p>“Can’t pay attention?” He looked to his mother to see if that was the correct answer.</p><p>“What’s the whistle for?” she asked the principal.</p><p>Mr. Cooper fingered the whistle as though noticing it for the first time and declined to answer. “I think Spencer wants to participate and enjoy things, but he often seems . . . stunned.”</p><p>“Stunned?” Mrs. Quantrill said. “Hardly.” Spencer reversed the order of his tennis shoes, placing his left foot on top of his right.</p><p>“Anyway, I think it might be in Spencer’s best interest to let him enjoy a spell in special ed—get the pressure off him a bit and let him spread his wings.”</p><p>“<em>Special ed</em>?” Mrs. Quantrill got to her feet, eyes flashing, plucked her coat from the back of her chair, and said, “Over my dead body.”</p><p>“I see. What do you think is best?”</p><p>“I’ll raise his standards in my own way. I have tickets to Bayreuth, and I shall take Spencer with me this year. No one leaves Wagner unimproved.”</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>“Wagner!”</p><p>“Ah.”</p><p>In the car, Mrs. Quantrill spoke non-stop. She glanced down Main Street and remarked, “What a hole.” It was nearly dark, and most of the small businesses there were being closed and locked by their owners. “Mr. Cooper means well, Spencer. He wants to help you, and he’s correct in noticing that your grades are not what they should be. That wretched water-bed outlet is finally going out of business! But we all develop at different speeds, and though I was tall and strong and popular at your age, your father was small and fearful, and just look how he turned out. The mighty oak, single acorn, et cetera. And, my angel, you’re going to love Bayreuth, this year especially, because we will see ‘Parsifal,’ and you’ll find out why Mommy calls you that, and you will be strengthened and return to school with something new that will be felt by everyone—students, teachers, and even nice Mr. Cooper, with that dopey whistle, who thought you should be in special ed. So let’s break the news to Daddy: it’s summer in Bavaria for all of us. Look, Spencer, there’s that place where Daddy bought those Italian snow tires. Why did Daddy think Italians would know how to make snow tires? When he slid off the road in front of the airport, he found out how much they know! You probably think I was pretty rude to the principal, what’s his name, but no, Spencer, I was only being direct. I’m not a bad person. I thought the faster he knew my feelings the better. I’m just going to let this policeman pass me. I don’t like feeling that I’m being followed, no matter who it is. Spencer, you’re too quiet, and it makes me think you’re disapproving. Are you asleep back there?”</p><p>After watching his mother leave the school parking lot without him, Spencer first considered going back into the school, but trying to explain to Mr. Cooper or anyone else how his mother just got caught up in her thoughts seemed to be beyond him. He was sure that if he waited she would eventually realize she had forgotten him, but standing there alone would have people wondering about him, so he set out walking, though it<span data-page="page_2"></span> was almost dark and getting cold. If she hadn’t driven off so fast, he would have been in his bedroom by now with his aquarium light turned on, the guppies and angelfish swimming around the bubbler or darting for the flakes of food he dropped.</p><p>He hadn’t seen this street before. Of all the houses along it, only two had lights bright enough to show where the sidewalk was. Spencer looked back and tried to remember how many turns he had made and why he thought he had been heading toward more lights instead of fewer. He stopped. His hat was in his desk at school, and his head was getting cold, but the idea of knocking on a stranger’s door to ask for a hat swept him with shyness and desperation.</p><p>A car turned onto the dark end of the street, and as its headlights hit Spencer it slowed to a crawl. Its lights were so bright that he covered his eyes until the car drew alongside him. Still blinded, Spencer could see no more than the outline of a man’s head in the driver’s window. It seemed a long time before the driver spoke. “Hello, son, you look like you could use a ride. Care to hop in?”</p><p>When Spencer opened the door to get in, the interior light came on, showing an older man with a white crewcut that stood straight up, wearing a buttoned sweater with a picture of an elk in its wool. Spencer got only a quick look, because when he closed the door the light went off and the man was just an outline again.</p><p>“Where are we headed, young man?”</p><p>Spencer didn’t know what to say and so said nothing.</p><p>“Better tell me where or I’ll run out of gas idling here like this.” [cartoon id="a19225"]</p><p>Spencer felt anxious trying to come up with a plausible answer. The driver had put the car in gear but took it out again and sat back and crossed his arms. Under pressure, Spencer wanted to blink. Finally, he said, “Bayreuth.”</p><p>“Buy-Rite? Jeez, that’s way on the other side of town. And it’s closed. Is someone picking you up at Buy-Rite?”</p><p>Spencer couldn’t speak.</p><p>“I wish you’d say something. You want to play the radio? You want me to play the radio? O.K., no radio.”</p><p>It occurred to Spencer that this was like school: he was always tongue-tied just when people wanted to help him. It would all get worked out at Bayreuth, he told himself, even if it was closed at this hour. His mother would take over the situation. She hadn’t meant to forget him and would soon have him back with his aquarium. Today was Thursday, and sometimes on Fridays his father brought him a fish in a water-filled zip-lock bag. Last time, it had been a Siamese fighting fish upside down in the bag, and it had had to go down the toilet. Then his dad had done some research and explained to Spencer that until they got a better bubbler they really couldn’t get another fish. So they got one with a little deep-sea diver with bubbles coming out of his helmet, but so far no new fish.</p><p>The car stopped under the “<em class="small">LIVE WELL—PHARMACY—PHOTO CENTER</em>” sign. “Is this it?” No one in sight. The pulsing red neon reflected off the dashboard and lit the side of the driver’s face. Spencer needed his mother here to do the talking.</p><p>He managed, “Maybe not.”</p><p>“Son, you gotta help me. Where do you want to go? I was supposed to be at the Legion ten minutes ago.”</p><p>“Maybe back to the school.”</p><p>“School is closed, too! O.K., please don’t cry. I shouldn’t have raised my voice, but this is getting to be a problem. There’s a Buy Rite Auto on the frontage road. That sound like it? No?” The driver gripped the wheel hard, then rested his head on it. “Please tell me where to take you. Stop, don’t open the glove compartment!”</p><p>“Is it loaded?”</p><p>“Yes, yes, put it back now. I have a permit for that. I need it. I’m a travelling salesman. Thank you.”</p><p>“Someday, I’ll have a gun.” And a big mustache, he thought.</p><p>“When you’re old enough and have received proper training. So, now where are we headed? Son, tell me the truth, do you actually want to go home?”</p><p>“There’s the road,” Spencer said, pointing to a road that angled off to the west, a road he had never seen before.</p><p>“How far?”</p><p>“It’s quite a ways.”</p><p>Soon, all the houses dropped away into the dark. It was possible to see the shapes of bluffs and, well back from the road and barely different from the stars, the occasional yard light at a ranch. A jackrabbit paused, lit up in the headlights, then vanished. For a while, the only sound was the pop of bugs against the windshield. The car came to a stop in the middle of the road, and the driver scratched his crewcut frantically with both hands, then covered his face. “I can see it now—kidnapping, child molester, the whole nine yards. Son, you have to get out of the car.” When he uncovered his face, Spencer was playing with the gun again.</p><p>“Oh, boy, how were you raised, anyway? That’s not a plaything.” The man reached over and took the gun from<span data-page="page_final"></span> Spencer. “I tried to help you. My conscience is clear. Out you go.” Spencer gripped the seat and didn’t budge. He wanted to keep going down the road. The man’s voice came in a roar. “Get the fuck out now before I hit you over the head! You’re starting to scare me.”</p><p>Spencer opened the door, hoping the driver would change his mind, then got out and closed the door. He had wanted to speak, but as he searched through his mind nothing came to him. It was wonderful how the night smelled and how huge the stars seemed as the car pulled slowly away, pushing open a strip of road with its headlights. Once the sound of its motor had faded, a roar of insects filled the emptiness. Spencer was very still as he followed his happiness to its source and smiled to think, No one knows where I am. The driver was a nice man, but maybe this is better.</p><p>Then the lights of the distant car seemed to circle, and Spencer saw that it was coming back. He looked quickly to his left and to his right, but he couldn’t move.</p><p>The driver leaned over to thrust open the passenger door. “Get in.”</p><p>Spencer did so and closed the door.</p><p>“Son, I can’t leave you out here by yourself. Something might happen to you.”</p><p>“I wasn’t scared.”</p><p>“You don’t know enough to be scared! God almighty!” As the car pulled forward, Spencer looked longingly into the dark. He thought of his mother and wondered if she would remember to feed the fish. He pictured them at the surface of the aquarium looking up at him, expecting to be fed. “As soon as we get to some town, I’m going to find a phone. Yes sirree, Bob, I’m gonna find me a phone and figure out where you belong.”</p><p>They crossed a creek on a noisy bridge where telephone poles had been stacked. Just beyond was an empty house and a car on blocks, then the road climbed slowly on a straightaway toward the first lights they had seen in a long time. As they approached, the driver slowed down, holding the top of his head with one hand: a sheriff’s car was parked there, and several officers stood on either side of the road near it. “An accident? Doesn’t seem like there’s enough cars to have one.” The driver rolled his window down. “But this is good, son. Maybe you’ll talk to these fellers.”</p><p>Two officers came to the driver’s door. They looked hard through the window at Spencer, glanced at each other, pulled open the door, dragged the driver onto the road, and handcuffed him behind his back. The opposite door opened, and Spencer was swept into the arms of a burly deputy. There were lights everywhere, and Spencer cried, but not for the reasons the worried lawmen believed.</p><p>On the radio, in the papers, but mostly in people’s mouths, news of the kidnapper ballooned. In town, the driver’s relatives were dismayed to learn of this side of his character and anxious to put some distance between them and him. The interrogator from Helena was delayed by a passing hailstorm, and by the time he got to the town jail the driver had done away with himself, an expression that Spencer failed to understand and which his mother explained by using her hands to illustrate a bird flying off. Even so, he suspected that he was being misled. Now the newscasters were full of questions as to whether it had been mothball- or golf-ball-size hail. A widow up at Ten Mile went on TV with a hailstone the size of a grapefruit, but subsequent investigation revealed it to be something from her freezer. ♦</p>	Thomas McGuane	September 28, 2015 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane	Children	Drivers	Kidnappings	Meetings	Montana		Spencer	Third	Children
The High Divide	<p>At <span data-page="page_1"></span>the Home I'd get up early, when the Sisters were still asleep, and head to the ancient Chinese man's store. The ancient Chinese man was a brown, knotted, shrivelled man who looked like a chunk of gingerroot and ran one of those tiny stores that sell grapefruits, wine, and toilet paper, and no one can ever figure out how they survive. But he survived, he figured it out. His ancient Chinese wife was a little twig of a woman who sat in a chair and never said a word. He spoke only enough English to conduct business, to say hello and goodbye, to make change, although every morning, when I came for my grapefruit, I tried to teach him some useful vocabulary.</p><p>I came out of the gray drizzle through the glass door with the old Fishback Appliance Repair sign still stencilled on it, a copper cowbell clanging above me, and the store was cold, the lights weren't even on. I went to the bin and picked through the grapefruits and found one that wasn't bad, a yellow ball, soft and square from sitting too long in the box, and then I went to the counter. The Chinese man wasn't there. His tiny branchlike wife was sitting in her chair, all bent up. I searched my pockets for show, knowing all along that I'd be a little short. I came up with twenty-seven cents, half a paper clip, a pen cap, and a ball of blue lint. I put the money in her hand and she stared at it. By the lonesome sound my nickels and pennies made when she sorted them into their slots I also knew that the till was empty.</p><p>I looked behind her through the beaded curtain to the small apartment behind the shop. Next to the kitchen sink was an apple with a bite out of it, the bite turned brown like an old laugh.</p><p>I held my grapefruit, tossed it up in the air, caught it.</p><p>Where is he? I asked.</p><p>She was chewing on a slice of ginger and offered me a piece, which I accepted. In the morning, they chewed ginger instead of drinking coffee.</p><p>Husband? I said.</p><p>She blinked and spat on the floor.</p><p><em>Meiyou xiwang</em>, she said. <em>Meiyou xiwang</em>.</p><p>She folded her hands, tangling the tiny brown roots together. <em>Meiyou xiwang</em>, she said, touching her heart, and sending her hands flying apart. Her singsong voice beat an echo against the bare walls. Her hands flapped like a bat. I shook my head. <em>Meiyou xiwang</em>, she insisted. Huh? I said, but I knew we could go on forever not making any sense. She hugged herself, like she was cold. I didn't know what to say. She'd travelled all this way, she'd left China and crossed the ocean and come to Bremerton and opened a little store and put grapefruit in the bins and Mogen David on the shelves, but she'd gone too far, because now she couldn't tell anybody what was happening to her anymore.</p><p>I had two projects at the Home. I was reading the encyclopedia, working through the whole circle of learning available to man, as the introduction said. I'd started with Ignatius Loyola, because I'm named after him, and the Inquisition, and this led me right into the topic of torture.</p><p>My other project involved learning Latin so I could be an altar boy. I got the idea one morning at Sacred Heart while I was staring at the cold altar and the Cross and winking at the nailed-up Christ to see if he'd wink back. Our priest said that he didn't go for the vernacular because it was vulgar. If you were God Eternal, he said, would you want to listen to such yowling? He said that everything in the Church was a sign for something else, and a priest was a man who knew all the signs, but an altar boy knew a few of them, too. I looked around the sanctuary. With the snowy marble slab of altar, the gilt dome of the tabernacle and its tiny doors, the chalices and cruets, the fresh-cut flowers, the sparkling candlelight, the sanctuary was like a foreign country, and if I knew the language I could go there.</p><p>Several times I read the Missal as far as the Minor Elevation, the part of the Mass just after you pray for the dead. <em>Per omnia saecula saeculorum</em>. <em>Amen</em>. World without end. Amen. But I was trying to learn Latin with phonetics—the Missal was Latin on one side, English on the other—and, needless to say, my comprehension was zero, and I was always finding myself back at the beginning, starting over. <em>Per omnia saecula saeculorum</em>, <em>amen!</em></p><p>Most of our schoolwork focussed on how to get into Heaven. Sister Eulalia, the catechism nun, taught us about sin and the opportunities for salvation. She was a short, wide old woman with thick glasses and blue eyes that drifted behind them like tropical fish. She kept calling Jesus the Holy Victim and the Word Made Flesh and the Unspotted Sacrifice. She said that sacrifice didn't mean to kill but to make holy. We are made in the image of God's great mystery but through our ignorance and despair our vision is clouded. Salvation, she told us, is our presence in a bright light where we at last become the perfect<span data-page="page_2"></span> image and reflection of our Creator.</p><p>We saw a slide show on the scapular. A boy was riding by a gas station on his bicycle. A man was pumping gas and a family was waiting in a car. Then the gas station was blowing up and the boy was flying through the air. Everybody died but the boy, who was wearing his scapular. Sister Eulalia passed around blank order forms and said to fill them out and bring $2.50 if you thought it was prudent to have a scapular for yourself. I'd spent all my money on grapefruits, though.</p><p>At night, in bed, I practiced my prayers. We had to memorize so many at the Home: Our Father, Hail Mary, Glory Be, Act of Faith, of Hope, of Love, of Contrition. Praying either put me to sleep or made me think of girls. Once, I passed a girl a note during class and Sister Josephine, the discipline nun, intercepted it and said someone my age doesn't know the least thing about love and shouldn't use that word the way I did. That kind of love is special, she said. It's a rare gift from God, it's the consummation of a union, and it's certainly nothing for children. Sister Josephine called it The Marriage Act. It's embarrassing for me to admit, but she made me cry, she was yelling so much. I never sent another note. Still, I attached a vague feeling of hope to different girls, a feeling of, I don't know, of whatever, that came out, some nights, when I said prayers.</p><p>We had to learn the prayers because we prayed for everything: we prayed for food, we prayed for sleep, we prayed for new basketballs. Three times a day, Sister Catherine, the food nun, took us to the church cafeteria for our meals. Volunteer ladies served us—they were all old and kind and had science-fiction hair, clouds of blue gas, burning white-hot rocket fuel, explosions of atomic frizz. I loved the endless stacks of white bread and the cold slabs of butter. When the nuns said I was underfoot, I went downstairs and studied the encyclopedias or read Latin or went outside and shot buses with my pump gun. Buses passed the Home every twenty-six minutes. I built up my arm pitching rocks at a tree until a circle of pulpy white wood was exposed in the bark. One afternoon I planted a sunflower in a milk carton.</p><p>I longed to go somewhere but there wasn't anywhere good that I knew of. Then one day I found the public-school yard.</p><p>What're you doing here, you stupid shit? asked one kid, a pudgy boy with skin like a baby.</p><p>He and some other boys pushed around me in a circle.</p><p>The pudge said, Who are you?</p><p>When I didn't answer, he said, You're one of those orphan bastards, right?</p><p>The boys crowded in closer and I was afraid to speak. People could tell you were from the Home by your haircut. We were all shaved up like the Dalai Lama.</p><p>Finally, I smiled and mumbled, If you say so.</p><p>What? the pudge said. I didn't hear you.</p><p>The circle of boys cinched like a knot. Their looming heads were way up in the sky.</p><p>Yeah, I said.</p><p>After that I sat below the monkey bars and chewed a butter sandwich and watched pudge-boy and his gang over by the water fountain with some girls and I knew I was going to have to kick his ass sooner or later. Everything else was new and strange but this seemed predictable and something I could rely on.</p><p>That spring the pudge had the nerve to try out for baseball. He wore brand-new cleats and threw like a fem and his mitt, also brand-new, very orange and stiff, wouldn't close. He might as well have been standing in right field with a piece of toast. He dropped everything. The second day of practice, we had an intrasquad game and I nailed him three times. I just chose places on his fat body and threw the ball at them. Eventually, pudge-boy was afraid to stand in the batter's box. The coach thought I had a control problem but I didn't. My control was perfect.</p><p>I whiffed nine guys and made the team and the pudge was cut. He walked away, crying. I ran down the hill and jumped on his back. I hit him in the face and the neck and beat on his ear over and over. You hear that? I shouted. You hear that, you fat fucker? Now that I had him alone I was insane. The pudge rolled away on the grass, holding his ear. Blood was coming out. He was bawling, and I hawked a gob of spit right into his black, wailing mouth and said, You bastard.</p><p>That night, I was asleep with the encyclopedia pitched like a tent over my nose when Sister Celestine, the head nun, came in.</p><p>Why weren't you at dinner?</p><p>I could hear the polished rocks of Sister Celestine's rosary rattling as she worried them between her fingers.</p><p>She pulled the encyclopedia off my head.</p><p>Won't you talk? Sister said.</p><p>She tucked a dry, stray shaft of hair back beneath her habit. Maybe you'd feel more comfortable making a confession?</p><p>I picked at the fuzzballs on my blanket.</p><p>I just got off<span data-page="page_3"></span> the phone with that boy's mother, she said.</p><p>She touched a cut on my lip and took a deep breath. She said you called him a name. Do you know what that name means?</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>She took off her scapular and put it around my neck. Two small pieces of brown wool hung on a cord, one in back, the other in front.</p><p>I rubbed the wool between my finger and thumb.</p><p>It's not magic, she said.</p><p>No?</p><p>More like a sign, she said, that helps guide people—she paused—like us. When you pray to it you never say Amen, because the prayer is continuous. It doesn't have an end. Before I received my calling, she said, I used to be a lot like you. I felt trapped. It was like I lived in a dark little corner of my own mind. She sighed. Ignatius, do you know what the opposite of love is?</p><p>Hate, I said.</p><p>Despair, Sister said. Despair is the opposite of love.</p><p>When the pudge came to the yard, he was obviously beat up and everybody wanted to know what happened. Before I could say anything, he came charging across the lot and said, Truce, truce. We shook hands and sat under the monkey bars, which had become my private territory.</p><p>I thought Catholics were pansies, he said.</p><p>Ignatius Loyola was a warrior, I said.</p><p>That's a weird name, the pudge said. My name's Donny.</p><p>Ignatius, I told him.</p><p>I'm sorry I called you a bastard, Donny said. He peeled a strip of red rubber off his tennis shoe and stretched and snapped it in the air. Then he put it in his mouth and chewed on it.</p><p>You should meet my dad, he said.</p><p>My dad used to race pigeons, I said. He had about a hundred of them.</p><p>Donny looked impressed. How do you race pigeons? he asked.</p><p>You just drive out to the country and let them go—they always find their way back to the coop. You can use pigeons to send messages.</p><p>My dad ate a pigeon once, Donny said. In France.</p><p>Donny told me about the Eurekan Territory, which was something he'd made up on summer vacation. The Eurekan Territory came from Eureka, California, where he had relatives he didn't like. All they did was drink greyhounds, he said, and talk about people you didn't know. They were always slapping their knees and saying Gosh, isn't that funny? when nothing was funny.</p><p>Donny wasn't a Catholic but I let him wear my scapular, which he kept on calling a spatula.</p><p>You should come over to our house, Donny said. It's big. My dad rakes it in.</p><p>I said, You want to go see my dad?</p><p>Donny looked at me. Where? he said.</p><p>What do you mean, where?</p><p>Isn't he dead?</p><p>Follow me, I said.</p><p>St. Jude's Hospital was a huge old brick building. A hurricane fence caged in a patio that was scattered with benches and garbage cans. We walked around the fence, plucking the cold wires with our fingers.</p><p>My dad was sitting on a bench with a loaf of bread and an orange. He wore a paper nightgown with snaps in the back. His eyes were like blown fuses, and dry white yuck made a crust around his mouth. Wind ruffled his hair. It was too cold to be outside in a paper outfit.</p><p>Don't you want a sweater? I said.</p><p>I climbed up the chain-link fence.</p><p>This is my friend Donny, I said. Donny, this is my dad, Tony Banner.</p><p>Dad was barefoot on one foot and wore a foam-rubber slipper on the other. He grabbed the fence and the links shivered. He looked out west, toward the Olympic Mountains, and we looked, too. It was getting dark.</p><p>Hey, Dad?</p><p>What?</p><p>He dropped a piece of bread through the fence, and a couple of cooing pigeons bobbed along the gutter and fought each other for it. They were ugly pigeons, dirty like a sidewalk. They were right under me and Donny's feet. I kicked one in the head. It fell over, and beat the dirt with its wings.</p><p>I'm learning quite a lot of prayers at school, I said.</p><p>That got him to laugh. The cuts on his hands were healing. That last week at our house he emptied all the soup cans in the garage and kept the rusty nails in his pockets. One morning for breakfast he served me a bowl of nails with milk and then squeezed a fistful of them in his hand until blood came out. He kept saying with his voice very loud and fast, I got the nails, I got the nails right here, boy—where's my cross, eh? Now he was gentle. He pushed bread through the fence until the loaf was gone and the pigeons flew away, except the one I'd kicked.</p><p>I gotta go home and eat, Donny said to me.</p><p>Donny's gotta go home and eat, I told my dad, translating for him. I've got to go eat, too.</p><p>I turned around once, real quick, and he was gripping the fence, looking off nowhere, then Donny and I crawled through a hole in the hedge.</p><p>Donny's dad asked us, Who wants to get the hell out of here? Who wants to go hiking in the Olympics? I'd spent most of my summer at Donny's<span data-page="page_4"></span> house, so I knew his parents. Mrs. Cheetam was a beautiful woman with silver-and-gold hair. Mr. Cheetam was a travelling salesman and wasn't home much but it was true, he raked it in. They bought Donny everything. Donny told me he had a sister who died of leukemia. He played me a cassette of her last farewell. Near the end of the tape she said, Donny? I love you, remember that. I want you to know that wherever I am, and wherever you are, I'll be watching. I'll be with you always. I love you. Do you hear me? Donny?</p><p>When she said that—I love you. Do you hear me? Donny?—I got a lonely sort of chill.</p><p>We're now leaving the Eurekan Territory! Donny said as we drove away, and I said, That's right. Goodbye, Eurekan Territory!</p><p>Mr. Cheetam listened to different tapes from a big collection he kept in a suitcase. They were old radio shows, and one I liked was called "The Shadow": Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? Mr. Cheetam and Donny knew all the words and talked right along with the tapes. The Shadow knows, they said, ha ha ha!</p><p>Later Donny woke up and asked, Where are we? Mr. Cheetam said, You see that river there, Donny? That's the Quinault River, and we're going to hike up along what's called the High Divide, and when we get to the top we'll be at the source of that river. You'll be able to skip right over it, he said, so remember how big it is now. Donny asked, What if we see the Sasquatch? I said we'd be famous, if we captured it. Or took a picture, Donny said. But I don't want to see it, he added. We parked at the ranger station and signed in. It was silent and we could hear our feet crunching the gravel. We cinched up our pack straps and looked at each other. This is it, Mr. Cheetam said. He looked up the trail. This is where we separate the men from the boys.</p><p>After about an hour, we cut off the main path and headed toward the river. This is where I buried my dad, Mr. Cheetam explained. I always visit once a year. Right beside the river was a tree, hanging over the water and shadowing everything. Initials were carved in the tree on the side facing the river. B.C. is Billy Cheetam, Donny said. That's my grandpa. Is he under the tree? I asked. No, no, Mr. Cheetam laughed. He was cremated and I scattered his ashes in the river. But this is the spot, he said. The river was deep and wide at that point. Mr. Cheetam asked if he and Donny could be alone to think and remember and I hiked back out to the main trail. I sat against a fallen log until Donny came back. He talks to him, Donny said. What's he say? I asked, but Donny didn't know.</p><p>Our first camp was disappointing because we could hear Boy Scouts hooting and farting around, a troop of about sixty in green uniforms with red or yellow hankies around their necks. It was like the Army, with pup tents everywhere. Mr. Cheetam said not to worry, higher up there won't be any Scouts.</p><p>We found wood and lit a campfire and made dinner—beef Stroganoff—and I sopped up all the gravy with my fingers. We washed the pots and pans with pebbles and sand in the river. Mr. Cheetam drank whiskey from a silver flask, wiping his lips and saying, Aaahhh, this is living!</p><p>The Boy Scouts sounded off with taps. Donny and I shared a smokewood stogie—a kind of gray stick you could smoke—and when it was quiet Mr. Cheetam cupped his hands around his mouth and moaned, Who stole my Golden Arm? Whooooo stoooole myyyy Goool-den Aaaarm? You could hear his voice echoing in the forest. Whoo stooole my Gooolden Aaarm? You did! Mr. Cheetam shouted, grabbing Donny. We crawled into our tents and I started laughing and Donny got hysterical, too. Mr. Cheetam had a different tent and told us to shut up.</p><p>Donny whispered how he hated the Japs and never wanted to be captured by them—they knew how to make you talk. I told him about the Inquisition and all the tortures they'd invented for getting confessions.</p><p>They had this one thing called the press, I said. If you were accused of a crime and didn't make a plea, the King ordered you to lie down. Then he piled rocks on you until you confessed the truth or got crushed.</p><p>How big were the rocks? Donny asked.</p><p>I don't know.</p><p>What if you had thirty—what if you had a hundred—no, wait, what if you had a thousand rocks on you and then you decided to tell the truth?</p><p>You could, I said. But if you said you <em>didn't</em> do anything, the King didn't want to hear that, and he'd just go ahead with another rock, until you admitted you <em>did</em> do it.</p><p>Donny hesitated, and I thought I understood.</p><p>I know, I said. <em>I know</em>.</p><p>At the next camp, only two people were around, a man and a woman, who were sitting naked on a rock in the river when we first arrived, but kept to themselves afterward. Donny and Mr. Cheetam<span data-page="page_5"></span> fished for a while but quit after Donny's hook got caught in the trees too many times. Mr. Cheetam said, Don't worry about it, Donny. It's no good down here. Higher up the water's colder and we'll catch tons of rainbows, maybe some Dolly Varden.</p><p>We ate a great meal of dehydrated chicken tetrazzini and pilot biscuits and chocolate for dessert. Donny and I shared more smokewood. Now and then we added sticks to the fire and the light breathed out and made a circle around us. I love getting away from it all, Mr. Cheetam said.</p><p>He tipped back his flask and in the bright curved silver I could see the fire flaming up.</p><p>Once upon a time, Mr. Cheetam said, there was a boy and girl who were very much in love.</p><p>Where was this? Donny asked.</p><p>Oh, Mr. Cheetam said, it doesn't matter, does it? Love's the same everywhere you go, so let's just make up a place.</p><p>How about the Eurekan Territory? I said.</p><p>O.K., Mr. Cheetam said. The Eurekan Territory, that's where they were in love. It was a small place, and everybody knew everybody else, so eventually people figured out this boy and girl had a thing going. You know what a thing is, right?</p><p>Donny said he did.</p><p>Good for you, Mr. Cheetam said. Well, this thing was frowned on by everyone. People took different sides, against the boy, or against the girl, everybody blaming everybody else. But the boy and girl were madly in love and you can't stop love, not when it's the real thing.</p><p>He went to his pack and pulled out a big bottle and refilled his flask. When he came back he said, You know what that's like, to have a real thing?</p><p>Donny said, Yeah, I know.</p><p>I mean really real, Mr. Cheetam said.</p><p>How real? I said.</p><p>Mr. Cheetam ignored me. To hell with what anybody thinks, these kids, these lovers, said. So one night the boy meets the girl on the edge of town and they drive up a dark winding road to a lover's leap. They can see everything from up there, but they're not looking. No siree, Bob. The boy and the girl sit in the car, spooning, as we used to call it back in the day—making out, and listening to love songs on the radio, until one of the songs is interrupted by a special bulletin. A prisoner has escaped!</p><p>Does the prisoner have hooks instead of hands? I asked.</p><p>Yeah, Mr. Cheetam said, that's the guy.</p><p>How'd you know? Donny asked.</p><p>I knew because the story wasn't true. The girl hears something outside, and the boy says, Oh, baby baby, don't worry, we're way up here above everything, we're safe. The boy tries to get at the girl, and the girl keeps hearing something outside. Eventually it's no fun, and they go home. When the boy opens the door for the girl to drop her out he finds a hook clawing and banging at the door handle, just clinging there, ripped right off the prisoner's arm.</p><p>Mr. Cheetam didn't scare me, but Donny was scared.</p><p>We were quiet for a minute, and then I told them about when my dad was driving in his car. The other car came out of nowhere, I said. And my dad was hanging half out the door. His foot was stuck under the clutch and his head was banging on the road. He was dragged about two hundred feet. He was in the hospital for a month. My mom died.</p><p>No one said anything, so I added, That's a true life story.</p><p>You don't think mine was? Mr. Cheetam asked. He looked at me strangely and winked.</p><p>Well, I said, yeah, I do. I know it is. I heard about those lovers before.</p><p>Mr. Cheetam stood up, stretched, and fell down. Donny and I looked at each other, then we got in our sleeping bags.</p><p>Your dad sure enjoys whiskey, I said.</p><p>In the middle of the night, Donny said, Hey, you hear that?</p><p>Come off it, I said.</p><p>I swear I heard something.</p><p>There's nothing out there, I said, but Donny went over to sleep in his dad's tent anyway.</p><p>We reached a sign that pointed different ways: the High Divide and the Low Divide. We took the high, up and up. There were fewer trees, and we climbed on loose rock called scree, and the air was thinner. Donny had an ugly blister on his heel and complained, and Mr. Cheetam got impatient with him. Just pull yourself up and get going, he said. Don't fall behind.</p><p>Finally we crossed a field full of pink and yellow wildflowers, and at the far end, where the path ended, was a lake. The surface was perfectly clear and placid and we could see ourselves.</p><p>Here we are, Mr. Cheetam said.</p><p>Skinny-dipping, Donny said.</p><p>First things first, girls, Mr. Cheetam said, so we hopped to, setting up camp and scrounging enough wood for the night.</p><p>Donny and I stripped naked and jumped off the cliffs. No one else was around but when we swam and shouted and splashed our voices bounced back and forth off the rocks. Ricochet, we yelled. We dove and dove. Then we lay on a hot flat rock. I noticed that Donny had hair on his balls and he probably<span data-page="page_6"></span> noticed so did I. You want to smoke a stogerooni? Donny asked. Nah, later, I said. We were stretched out and quiet: blue sky, yellow sun, white mountain—everything was perfect but Donny got antsy doing nothing for so long and took another dip. He came up fast and said, A fish! I saw a fish! And he got his fishing pole and caught a rainbow, like pulling a prayer from the water.</p><p>Good work, Donny, Mr. Cheetam said.</p><p>The fish wasn't all the way dead yet and Mr. Cheetam had to slap its head against a rock. Blood came out the eyes. The knife blade sank into the skin with a ripping sound. What do we do with the guts? I asked. Toss 'em in the lake, Mr. Cheetam said. We don't want any animals coming into camp. Bears? Donny said. It's not impossible, Mr. Cheetam said, but not likely, either. Maybe the Sasquatch, Donny said. Mr. Cheetam said to shut up about that damned Sasquatch. It's time you grow up, he said, shaking Donny's arm. Jesus, Donny said, rubbing himself.</p><p>Mr. Cheetam wrapped the fillets in foil and set them on the fire. It was soft out now, not dark but not light, either. Our shadows were weak around the fire, and Mt. Olympus was tinged pink and purple, and the wind died down.</p><p>Hey, I said, what about the Quinault?</p><p>Yeah, the Quinault! Donny said. You said I'd get to walk across it.</p><p>Oh crap, what was I thinking? Mr. Cheetam asked himself. You already did and I forgot, God damn it!</p><p>We ran back through the darkening wildflowers. We found a little stream about a foot wide and three inches deep that you would never think was a river but it was. There's your mighty Quinault, Donny, Mr. Cheetam said. Donny asked if we built a dam would the river dry up below and Mr. Cheetam laughed, saying, No, I'm afraid it doesn't work that way. We bent down and drank and splashed our faces in the water. We listened to the little river, trickling in a whisper. It was almost like nothing.</p><p>The fish was all burned to hell when we got back to camp. Donny was upset and kept whining. I'm sorry, Mr. Cheetam said, but things happen. What can I say? Then he offered, Tomorrow? You want to stay another day? Donny looked at me, then said, Stay! Stay! O.K., Mr. Cheetam said, I think we've got everything we need—plenty of provisions—and we'll catch some more fish.</p><p>After dinner, Mr. Cheetam drew out his flask again. His face was like my dad's had been in the last days, rough and black. One night toward the end I'd found him, my dad, in our broom closet. He had all his Bob Dylan records out and was writing new lyrics on them with a nail. Other things happened that I prefer to keep to myself. All week his loud voice was like the echo of thoughts he'd had a long time ago. Then one morning at the very end I heard him calling me in the rain. He was on top of our house in boxer shorts, yelling. Our neighbor tried to drive him off the roof by throwing a pot of geraniums at him. My dad started ripping apart the chimney and pitching bricks down on me and everybody else on the front lawn. We had to call the authorities. For a while he thought he was Jesus in a hospital called St. Judas, but it was really St. Jude's and my dad, of course, wasn't Jesus. The same people who took him to the hospital brought me to the Home. I hadn't eaten in three days.</p><p>Nearby we saw field mice hopping around, and Mr. Cheetam said that we'd better keep our packs inside the tents tonight. He hooked his arm around Donny's neck and said, How'd you like to go to California?</p><p>Not Eureka, Donny said.</p><p>No, Mr. Cheetam said, L.A.</p><p>Donny said he didn't know anything about L.A. Mr. Cheetam fussed with the fire, arranging the coals. When that goes out that's it until morning, he said. He tipped back the flask. Then he capped it and said, That's it for that, too. He stretched and groaned and walked out where the firelight failed. I heard him whistling in the dark.</p><p>Son? Mr. Cheetam said.</p><p>What? Donny asked.</p><p>Come on over here a minute, Mr. Cheetam said.</p><p>They were in the shadows. I heard Donny say, What does Mom think?</p><p>That's the thing, Mr. Cheetam said. Your mother would stay.</p><p>I don't know, Donny said. How long would we be gone?</p><p>Donald, Mr. Cheetam said, don't be stupid. We're divorcing, your mom and I. You see, we won't come back—we'll live in a brand-new house there.</p><p>Donny begged, But why?</p><p>Donald, come on. You see how things are.</p><p>The two of them were quiet and staring ahead, like their next thoughts might fall out of the sky.</p><p>What can I say? Mr. Cheetam said.</p><p>Nothing, Donny said.</p><p>I love you, Donald. You know that.</p><p>I crawled inside our tent. A little while later, Donny got in his bag, buried down inside. He was crying and choking. I whispered, Donny, hey, hey Donny? Donny? I think I hear something out there. Do you hear it? Let's go look! I hugged my arm around<span data-page="page_final"></span> him and he started jerking in his bag and sat up and cried to me, Here's your stupid spatula! Then he crossed over into Mr. Cheetam's tent but kept crying and begging even louder for no divorce.</p><p>Look, I heard Mr. Cheetam say, after your sister died— His voice fell apart. That's too easy, he said. I've met someone else. He was quiet a minute. That's the truth.</p><p>I thought the crying would go on forever, but eventually Donny must have fallen asleep.</p><p>I turned over and over in my sleeping bag, and then I put on Sister Celestine's scapular and grabbed the flashlight and crawled out of the tent. The fire made a hiss and I kicked the last few embers around in the bed of ash. Mr. Cheetam snorted in his sleep and I heard Donny say, Dad? and Mr. Cheetam say, What? but there was nothing after that, even though I stood outside their tent a long time, listening.</p><p>I aimed my flashlight ahead to the flat rock rim of the lake and followed the narrow beam up there. I sat, dangling my feet, and snapped off the light. I think I was feeling sorry for myself. Suddenly it felt like we'd been gone for ages. Was it Sunday? I gathered up ten rocks for a rosary, to count my prayers. I rattled them in my hands and started the Our Father but my voice was weird. I shook the rocks in my fist like dice. I threw one in the lake, and a little while later I heard the splash. Circles opened out where the stone had vanished. I thought of saying something in Latin but couldn't recall a single word, except amen. I yelled out, A-men! and heard back, Hey-men, hey-men, hey-men, smaller and smaller.</p><p>I stretched out on the rock. Sister Celestine's scapular was old, the wool worn soft from handling. Once, at the Home, I had climbed the stairs, six flights up from my room in the basement, to see where she lived. We weren't supposed to go up there. I saw why. Hosiery hung from the water pipes. Candy wrappers were crumpled on the floor. A black habit lay like an empty sack beside the bed. The bed was unmade, and I could see the hollow where Sister Celestine slept. A pale-green blanket and a thin yellow top sheet had been twisted into a tight braid and kicked off the end of the mattress. The only decoration was a black wooden crucifix, nailed on the wall above the bed like a permanent shadow.</p><p>I was still lying there when Donny and Mr. Cheetam came running up the rock in their undies. Hey, what's going on? they asked. They said they'd heard me shouting and were afraid I'd got lost or seen something.</p><p>Maybe the Sasquatch, Donny said.</p><p>God damn it, Donald, there is no such thing, Mr. Cheetam said. That's just a myth.</p><p>Oh yeah, Donny said. How do you know?</p><p>Don't worry, I said. It was nothing.</p><p>You sure? Donny said.</p><p>It was nothing, I said. I'm sure.</p><p>A wind was blowing and it was a little cold on that rock. Nobody knew what to say.</p><p>See out there? Above Mt. Olympus? That green star? Mr. Cheetam said, pointing. We all looked—a vague white shadow, a green light. It's not really a star. That's a planet—that's Venus, Mr. Cheetam said. The goddess of love.</p><p>That's just a <em>myth</em>, Donny said, looking at his father. Bastard.</p><p>I didn't hear you, Mr. Cheetam said. What did you say?</p><p>Nothing, Donny said.</p><p>Nothing? It didn't sound like nothing to me.</p><p>I pitched another rock in the lake, way out there, as far as possible. We all listened. Across the water a circle spread out, wider and wider. Then, shaking with cold, Donny folded his arms around himself and yelled out, Hey, and we heard back, Hey, hey, hey, and then I yelled out, Hey, and even Mr. Cheetam joined in, and we kept hearing back, Hey, hey, hey, like there were millions of us everywhere. ♦</p>	Charles D'Ambrosio	February 3, 2003 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/02/03/the-high-divide	Automobiles - Accidents	Camping	Catholic Church	Children	Divorce	Echoes	Unnamed	First	Children
The Knocking	<p>Upstairs, <span data-page="page_1"></span>he stops for a moment, just to let the tension build, and then he begins again, softer at first, going east to west and then east again, heading toward the Fifth Avenue side of the building, pausing to get his bearings, to look out at the view, to taunt me, I imagine, before going back into motion for a few minutes, setting the pace with a pendulous movement, following the delineation of the apartment walls—his the same as mine, exactly the same—and then there is another pause, and I lean back and study the ceiling and hear, far off, the sound of knocking in his kitchen, until eventually, maybe five minutes, maybe more, he comes back and begins again persistent and steady, without the usual aggression, as if he had forgotten me, set me aside, put away his desire for vengeance, offering a reprieve from the nature of his knocking. Maybe a five-minute reprieve, more or less, because it is impossible to guess how long these quiet moments will last when they open up overhead, since I know, as I wait, that the knocking will begin again, if not in the form of his tapping heel, then as some other kind of knocking: perhaps the sound of the hammer he uses to pound nails (he’s a big nail pounder; he’ll hang pictures at all hours), or the rubbery thud of his printer at work (he’s a big printer, scrolling out documents in the wee hours of the morning, at dusk, and at dawn), or the thump of his mattress hitting the slats, accompanied by the wheeze of springs (the wheeze not officially a knocking, but functioning as a kind of arabesque, a grace note to the mattress knocks that arrive after he’s done some easeful swaying in his bed).</p><p>Other sounds, too, that might be included in the knocking family accumulate in my mind this afternoon, an entire cornucopia of noises stretching back to the day I moved in, two years ago—pot/pan banging, dull plaster thud, bubbling water dribble, the claw-scratch titter that continued for a week, the incessant moaning, and the grief-filled swooning sound that arose intermittently and at first sounded human but then, in the course of a few days, took on a mechanistic, reproduced quality that made me certain it was a recording, a tape loop of some sort. He was that kind of knocker. He was willing to go beyond the call of duty to find a way to make a new noise and then to repeat it endlessly. He was the kind of knocker who would learn a fresh technique, a manner of landing his heel on the floor, of lifting his toes and letting them rattle a board, and work with a calisthenic efficiency—all bones and sinew—to transmit the sound via the uncarpeted prewar floorboards of his apartment, woody, resonant oak, solid enough to withstand the harder strikes. He not only took knocking seriously but went beyond that, to a realm of pure belief in the idea that by being persistent and knocking only for the sake of knocking—in other words, blanking me at least temporarily out of his consciousness, and in doing so forgetting the impulse (our brief meeting in the hall) for starting to knock in the first place—he could increase his level of concentration, achieve rapture, and, in turn, strengthen his ability to sustain the knocking over the long run. By casting off that original impetus (our brief hallway exchange that was not really a friendly greeting but a curt nod of heads, in which it seemed to me that we agreed to a mutual distaste for each other while, at the same time, our stories—in one of those fleeting, New York-style flashes—were conveyed), he could hit the floor with his heels while I, below, heard him and knew that he was doing so driven by a faith that went beyond retribution. (I’d tried, long ago, to return the knocks, pounding the ceiling with a broom handle, getting up on a stepladder to follow the footfalls, only to find that, as the one below, I was unable to fend off the knocking; because to knock up is not the same as to knock down, and any sound that resides at the feet most certainly isn’t the same as a sound that comes down upon the head.)</p><p>Theoretically, there is still debate about the nature of the knock in relation to the listener, of course, and one can easily postulate that a knock not heard is not a knock but, rather, a sound, pure and simple, and that to qualify as an official knock the sound not only must be heard but also must arrive in the ears with an annoying quality. To be sure, there are gentle knocks, sweet knocks, but those usually fall into the category of soft rappings: the late-night arrival, the lover-to-lover, message-through-the-wall (often adulterous) tap; the old-school, salesman-at-the-door, Fuller Brush five-knuckle rap—a deep anachronism now, replaced long ago by the doorbell, which, in turn, has been replaced by the telephone ring. To the recipient of the knock, all theories, no matter how plausible or how sensible, are destroyed by the sound itself. Imaginative capacities gather around the knock. A hammer against a nail, sharp and determined, goes on a beat too long, pounding and pounding throughout an entire evening, with metronomic precision. The rounded edge<span data-page="page_2"></span> of a sap—lead in leather—is slapped against the floorboards overhead, making a blunt rubbery thud with a leathery overtone. A sharp metallic tap, not too loud and not too soft, comes out from under the casual noise of a summer afternoon—the roar of traffic on Fifth combined with high-heeled taps, taxi horns, and the murmur of voices—with a hauntingly pristine quality, like the tin tip of a walking stick. A sweeping sound stretches from one side of the head to the other, arriving one afternoon . . . Again, many of these knockings come late in the day, when he knows, because he does know, that I’m in my deepest state of reverie, trying to ponder—what else can one do!—the nature of my sadness in relation to my past actions, throwing out, silently, wordlessly, my theorems: Love is a blank senseless vibration that, when picked up by another soul, begins to form something that feels eternal (like our marriage) and then tapers and thins and becomes wispy, barely audible (the penultimate days in the house by the Hudson), and then is, finally, nothing but air unable to move anything (the deep persistent silence of loss; Mary gone, kids gone).</p><p>One afternoon—as I was remembering how it felt to slide my hand along Mary’s hips, or the way her skin smoothed out around her belly and grew bone hard and then softer and flatter until I got to the even softer wetness—the sweeping sound began, not a knocking but simply the sound of a man upstairs straightening his apartment in the middle of a hot New York afternoon—a clean, easy sound at first. Nothing to it—no knocking—until my attention was drawn away from reverie (Mary) and I detected within the sound a hardness, a pressing nature, and became aware, over the course of what seemed to be an hour, that the sound remained just above my head, with a steadiness that went beyond the nature of the task. There was keen deliberateness. He was going to sweep his way through the floor, the joists and plaster. At some point the sweet, even anachronistic, broom swish switched over to knock mode; not so much the actual sound but, rather, the intent behind the gesture had gone from the act of sweeping to the sound that the act made, so that it was clear to me below that what had started out as a normal cleaning routine had, perhaps in response to my moaning and occasional shouts up at the ceiling between sweeps, shifted to knocking. In other words, at some point his desire to sweep had morphed into a desire to knock.</p><p>Another example: One relatively quiet afternoon—just the dull murmur of televisions going on all sides, the occasional voice in the air shaft—my friend upstairs decided to hang a picture of some kind, or to pound a nail for some other reason (is there another reason?), and he began with the occasional tap, teasingly working the point of the nail into the plaster. It was a tidy sound, with something pleasant in it. The hammerhead against the nail. Force being transferred to the tapered point, easing into the plaster, finding the gap where the plaster opens into void. I listened with pleasure. Leaning back in my chair, I thought, Go on, old boy! Pound away! Get that nail in there! Don’t pause too long or you’ll lose your sense of the task! Get to work! Find some semblance of rhythm in the strikes! Hold the hammer low and let it swing lightly to avoid pressure on the inside of the wrist! Get into that pure state if you can, and let the head fall in accordance with the demands of the nail itself ! If need be, go back in your mind to those long afternoons in the house in Westchester, when you were neatly tied up in your matrimonial vows and waiting to see what the next project might bring in the way of quietude: some afternoon, cutting into a board, or feeling your way around a broken water valve in a dark recess. Let the pounding become one with your own sense of needing to get something done, physically, to see some effort transposed from thumb to forefinger, so to speak, smoothing down freshly poured concrete with a trowel, feeling the gelatinous shift of substance. Whatever it is, I thought, or maybe even shouted—because I was prone to instruct him when necessary and might have shouted up at the ceiling—whatever it is you’re doing, get it done swiftly and with clean strokes and avoid catching yourself up in the task itself. Go to it, old boy! I’m sure I said. Get into it! Pound away! The age of the handy task is waning. We’re in the twilight of the age of knocking, I’m sure I said. The great tradition is on its way out, I know I said, I think, because he was going full bore with a terrifying, frenetic efficiency, pinpointing the sound with a steady, ecstatic perfection. He was the greatest of all knockers. He was a brilliant virtuosic master of the form, landing thuds in what seemed an intuitively perfect way. No intent, no human intent of any kind, could find such a precise way to make the sound he made. He was at the top of his form. Each knock had my name on it!<span data-page="page_final"></span> Each knock spoke directly to me! His was the work of a man on the edge of madness. A man who had lost just about everything, and was channelling all his abilities into his knocking. He was seeking the kind of clarity you could get only by bothering another soul, down below (never up) in his own abode, hunkering down on a hot summer afternoon on the great insular isle of the Manhattoes, trying to put the pain of a lost marriage behind him (Mary!), along with fond memories of a time when the desire he felt for his wife was equally matched by her desire for him (presumably); when there had been a great exchange of love between two souls, or at least what seemed to be, and he had gone about his days, puttering, fixing things, knocking about in a much less artistic manner, trying the best he could to keep the house in shape. ♦</p>	David Means	March 15, 2010 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/03/15/the-knocking	Apartments	Breakups	Children	Divorce	Grief	Nails	Unnamed	First	Children
The Third-Born	<p>One <span data-page="page_1"></span>cold, dewy morning, you are huddled, shivering, on the packed earth under your mother’s cot. Your anguish is the anguish of a boy whose chocolate has been thrown away, whose remote controls are out of batteries, whose scooter is busted, whose new sneakers have been stolen. This is all the more remarkable since, wealth-obsessed though you will come to be, you’ve never in your life seen any of these things.</p><p>The whites of your eyes are yellow, a consequence of spiking bilirubin levels in your blood. The virus afflicting you is called hepatitis E. Its typical mode of transmission is fecal-oral. Yum. It kills only about one in fifty, so you’re likely to recover. But right now you feel like you’re going to die.</p><p>Your mother has encountered this condition many times, or conditions like it, anyway. So maybe she doesn’t think you’re going to die. Then again, maybe she fears it. Everyone is going to die, and, when a mother sees in a third-born child like you pain that makes you whimper under her cot, maybe she feels your death push forward a few decades, take off its dark, dusty head scarf, and settle with open-haired familiarity and a lascivious smile into this, the single mud-walled room she shares with all her surviving offspring.</p><p>What she says is “Don’t leave us here.”</p><p>She is addressing your father, who has heard this request before. That does not make him completely unsusceptible to it, however. He is a man of voracious sexual appetite, and he often thinks, while he is away, of your mother’s heavy breasts and ample thighs, and he still longs to thrust himself inside her nightly rather than on his three or four visits per year. He also enjoys her unusually rude sense of humor, and sometimes her companionship as well. And although he is not given to displays of affection toward his young, he would like to watch you and your siblings grow. His own father derived considerable pleasure from the daily progress of crops in the fields, and in this, at least insofar as agriculture is analogous to the development of children, the two men are similar.</p><p>He says, “I can’t afford to bring you to the city.”</p><p>“We could stay with you in the quarters.”</p><p>“I share my room with the driver. He’s a masturbating, chain-smoking, flatulent sisterfucker. There are no families in the quarters.”</p><p>“You earn ten thousand now. You’re not a poor man.”</p><p>“In the city, ten thousand makes you a poor man.”</p><p>He gets up and walks outside. Your eyes follow him, his leather sandals unslung at the rear, their straps flapping free, his chapped heels callused, crustacean-like. He steps into the open-air courtyard situated at the center of your extended family’s compound. He is unlikely to linger there in contemplation of the single, shade-giving tree, comforting in summer, but now, in spring, still tough and scraggly. Possibly he exits the compound and makes his way to the ridge behind which he prefers to defecate, squatting low and squeezing forcefully to expel the contents of his colon. Possibly he is alone, or possibly he is not.</p><p>Beside the ridge is a gully as deep as a man is tall, and at the bottom of that gully is a slender trickle of water. In this season the two things are incongruous, a skeletal figure wearing the tunic of an obese pastry chef. Only briefly, during the monsoon, does the gully fill to anything near capacity, and even that is an occurrence less regular now than in the past, dependent on increasingly fickle atmospheric currents.</p><p>The people of your village relieve themselves downstream of where they wash their clothes, a place, in turn, downstream of where they drink. Farther upstream, the village before yours does the same. Farther still, where the water emerges from the hills as a sometimes gushing brook, it is partly employed in the industrial processes of an old, rusting, and subscale textile plant, and partly used as drainage for the foul-smelling gray effluent that results.</p><p>Your father is a cook, but, despite being reasonably good at his job, he is not a man obsessed with the freshness or quality of his ingredients. Cooking for him is a craft of spice and oil. His food burns the tongue and clogs the arteries. When he looks around him in the countryside, he does not see prickly leaves and hairy little berries for an effervescent salad, tan stalks of wheat for a heavenly balloon of stone-ground, stovetop-baked flatbread. He sees, instead, units of backbreaking toil. He sees hours and days and weeks and years. He sees the labor by which a farmer exchanges his allocation of time in this world for an allocation of time in this world. Here, in the heady bouquet of nature’s pantry, your father sniffs mortality.</p><p>Most of the men of the village who now work in the city return for the wheat harvest. But it is still too early in the year for that. Your father is here on leave. Nonetheless, he likely accompanies his brothers to spend his morning cutting grass and clover for fodder. He will squat, again, but this time sickle in hand, and his movements of gather-cut-release-waddle will be repeated over and over and over as the sun retraces its own incremental path in the sky.</p><p>Beside him, a single dirt road<span data-page="page_2"></span> passes through the fields. Should the landlord or his sons drive by in their S.U.V., your father and his brothers will bring their hands to their foreheads, bend low, and avert their eyes. Meeting the gaze of a landlord has been a risky business in these parts for centuries, perhaps since the beginning of history. Recently, some men have begun to do it. But they have beards and earn their keep in the seminaries. They walk tall, with chests out. Your father is not one of them. In fact, he dislikes them almost as much as he does the landlords, and for the same reasons. They strike him as domineering and lazy.</p><p>Lying on your side with one ear on the packed earth, from your worm’s-height perspective you watch your mother follow your father into the courtyard. She feeds the water buffalo tethered there, tossing fodder that was cut yesterday and mixed with straw into a wooden trough, and milks the animal as it eats, jets of liquid smacking into her tin pail. When she is done, the children of the compound, your siblings and cousins, lead the buffalo, its calf, and the goats out to forage. You hear the swishing of the peeled branches the children hold, and then they are gone.</p><p>Your aunts leave the compound next, bearing clay pots on their heads for water and carrying clothes and soap for cleaning. These are social tasks. Your mother’s responsibility is solitary. This is not a coincidence. She squats as your father is likely squatting, a handleless broom in her hand instead of a sickle, her sweep-sweep-waddle approximating his movements. Squatting is energy-efficient and better for the back. But, after hours and days and weeks and years, its mild discomfort echoes in the mind like muffled screams from a subterranean torture chamber. The pain can be borne endlessly, provided it is never acknowledged.</p><p>Your mother cleans the courtyard under the gaze of her mother-in-law. The old woman sits in shadow, the edge of her shawl held in her mouth to conceal not her attributes of temptation but, rather, her lack of teeth, and looks on in unquenchable disapproval. Your mother is regarded in the compound as vain and arrogant and headstrong, and these accusations have bite, for they are all true. Your grandmother tells your mother she has missed a spot. Because she is toothless and holds the cloth between her lips, when she speaks it sounds like she is spitting.</p><p>Your mother and grandmother play a waiting game. The older woman waits for the younger woman to age; the younger woman waits for the older woman to die. It is a game both will inevitably win. In the meantime, your grandmother flaunts her authority whenever she can, and your mother flaunts her physical strength. The other women of the compound would be frightened of your mother were it not for the reassuring existence of the men. In an all-female society your mother would likely rise to be queen, a bloody staff in her hand and crushed skulls beneath her feet. Here the best she has been able to manage is, for the most part, to be spared severe provocation. Even this, cut off as she is from her own village, is no small victory.</p><p>Unsaid between your mother and your father is that on ten thousand a month he could, just barely, afford to bring her and his children to the city. It would be tight but not impossible. At the moment he is able to send most of his salary back to the village, where it is split between your mother and the rest of the clan. If she and you children were to move in with him, the flow of his money to this place would slow to a trickle, swelling like the water in the gully only in the two festival months when he could perhaps expect a bonus.</p><p>You watch your mother slice up a lengthy white radish and boil it over an open fire. The sun has banished the dew and, unwell as you are, you no longer feel cold. You feel weak, though, and with the pain in your gut it is as if a parasite were eating you alive from within. So you do not resist as your mother lifts your head off the earth and ladles her elixir into your mouth. It smells like a burp, like the gases from a man’s belly. It makes your gorge rise. But you have nothing inside that you can vomit, and you swallow it without incident.</p><p>As you lie motionless afterward, a jaundiced village boy, radish juice dribbling from the corner of your lips and forming a small patch of mud on the ground, it must seem that getting filthy rich is beyond your reach. But have faith. You are not as powerless as you appear. Your moment is about to come.</p><p>Decision time arrives a few hours later. The sun has set and your mother has shifted you onto the cot, where you lie swaddled in a blanket even though the evening is warm. The men have returned from the fields, and the family, all except you, have eaten together in the courtyard. Through the doorway you can hear the gurgle of a water pipe and see the flare of its coals as one of your uncles inhales.</p><p>Your parents stand over<span data-page="page_3"></span> you, looking down. Tomorrow your father will return to the city. He is thinking.</p><p>“Will you be all right?” he asks you.</p><p>It is the first question he has asked you on this visit, perhaps the first sentence he has uttered directly to you in months. You are in pain and frightened. So the answer is obviously no.</p><p>Yet you say, “Yes.”</p><p>And take your destiny into your own hands.</p><p>Your father absorbs your croak and nods. He says to your mother, “He’s a strong child, this one.”</p><p>She says, “He’s very strong.”</p><p>You’ll never know if it is your answer that makes your father change his answer. But that night he tells your mother that he has decided she and you children will join him in the city.</p><p>A month later, you are well enough to ride with your brother and sister on the roof of the overloaded bus that bears your family and threescore cramped others to the city. If it tips over as it careens down the road, swerving in mad competition with equally crowded rivals as they seek to pick up the next group of prospective passengers on this route, your likelihood of death or, at least, dismemberment will be extremely high. Such things happen often, although not nearly as often as they don’t happen. But today is your lucky day.</p><p>Gripping the ropes that bind luggage to this vehicle, you witness a passage of time that outstrips its chronological equivalent. Just as a quick shift in altitude can vault one from subtropical jungle to semi-arctic tundra, so, too, can a few hours on a bus from rural remoteness to urban centrality appear to span millennia.</p><p>Atop your inky-smoke-spewing, starboard-listing conveyance, you survey the changes with awe. Dirt streets give way to paved ones, potholes grow less frequent and soon all but disappear, and the kamikaze rush of oncoming traffic vanishes, to be replaced by the enforced peace of the dual carriageway. Electricity makes its appearance, first in passing as you slip below a steel parade of high-voltage giants, then later in the form of wires running at bus-top eye level on either side of the road, and finally in streetlights and shop signs and glorious, magnificent billboards. Buildings go from mud to brick to concrete, then shoot up to an unimaginable four stories, even five.</p><p>At each subsequent wonder you think you have arrived, that surely nothing could belong more to your destination than this, and each time you are proved wrong, until you cease thinking and simply surrender to the layers of marvels and visions washing over you like the walls of rain that follow one another seemingly endlessly in the monsoon—endlessly, that is, until they end, without warning, and then the bus shudders to a stop and you are finally, irrevocably there.</p><p>As you and your parents and siblings dismount, you embody one of the great changes of your time. Where once your clan was innumerable, not infinite but of a large number not readily known, now there are five of you. Five. The fingers on one hand, the toes on one foot, a minuscule aggregation when compared with shoals of fish or flocks of birds or, indeed, tribes of humans. In the history of the evolution of the family, you and the millions of other migrants like you represent an ongoing proliferation of the nuclear. It is an explosive transformation—the supportive, stifling, stabilizing bonds of extended relationships weakening and giving way, leaving in their wake insecurity, anxiety, productivity, and potential.</p><p>Your sister turns to look at you. Her left hand steadies the enormous bundle of clothing and possessions balanced on her head. Her right hand grips the handle of a cracked and battered suitcase likely discarded by its original owner around the time your father was born. She smiles and you smile in return, your faces small ovals of the familiar in an otherwise unrecognizable world. You think your sister is trying to reassure you. It does not occur to you, young as you are, that it is she who needs reassurance, that she seeks you out not to comfort you but, rather, for the comfort that you, her only recently recovered little brother, have in this moment of fragile vulnerability the capacity to offer her.</p><p>Your city is not laid out as a single-celled organism, with a wealthy nucleus surrounded by an ooze of slums. It lacks sufficient mass transit to move all its workers twice daily in the fashion this would require. It also lacks, since the end of colonization, generations ago, governance powerful enough to dispossess individuals of their property in sufficient numbers. Accordingly, the poor live near the rich. Wealthy neighborhoods are often divided by a single boulevard from factories and markets and graveyards, and those, in turn, may be separated from the homes of the impoverished only by an open sewer, a railroad track, or a narrow alley. Your own triangle-shaped community, through which you walk now, textbook in hand, is bounded by all three.</p><p>Arriving at your destination, you see a whitewashed building with a plaque declaring its name and function. This is your school, and it is wedged between a tire-repair stall and a corner kiosk that derives the bulk of its revenues from the sale of cigarettes. Until the age of about twelve, when the opportunity cost of<span data-page="page_4"></span> forgone wages becomes significant, most children in your area manage to go to school. Most, but by no means all. A boy your height is working shirtless in the tire-repair stall. He watches you now as you pass.</p><p>There are fifty pupils in your class, and stools for thirty. The others sit on the floor or stand. You are instructed by a hollow-cheeked, betel-nut-spitting, possibly tubercular teacher. Today he takes you through your multiplication tables. This he does in a distracted chant, his preferred, indeed only, pedagogical tool being enforced rote memorization. Parts of his mind not responsible for control over the tissue and bone of his vocal apparatus wander far, far away.</p><p>Your teacher chants, “Ten tens, a hundred.”</p><p>The class chants it back.</p><p>Your teacher chants, “Eleven elevens, a hundred twenty-one.”</p><p>The class chants it back.</p><p>Your teacher chants, “Twelve twelves, a hundred thirty-four.”</p><p>One foolhardy voice interrupts. It says, “Forty-four.”</p><p>There is silence. The voice is yours. You spoke without thinking, or, at least, without thinking sufficiently ahead.</p><p>Your teacher says, “What did you say?”</p><p>You hesitate. But it has happened. There is no way back.</p><p>“Forty-four.”</p><p>Your teacher’s tone is soft with menace. “Why did you say that?”</p><p>“Twelve twelves are a hundred forty-four.”</p><p>“You think I’m an idiot?”</p><p>“No, sir. I thought you said a hundred thirty-four. I made a mistake. You said a hundred forty-four. I’m sorry, sir.”</p><p>The entire class knows that your teacher did not say a hundred forty-four. Or perhaps not the entire class. Much of the class was paying no attention, daydreaming of kites or assault rifles, or rolling nasal residue into balls between their thumbs and forefingers. But some of them know. And all of them know what will happen next, if not the precise form it will take. They watch now in horrified fascination, like seals on a rock observing a great white breaching beneath one of their own.</p><p>Most of the pupils have in the past been punished by your teacher. You, as one of the brightest among them, have drawn some of the most severe punishments. You attempt to hide your knowledge, but every so often bravado gets the better of you and it comes out, as it just has, and then there is hell to pay. Today your teacher reaches into the pocket of his tunic, where he keeps a small amount of coarse sand, and grips you by the ear, the sand on his fingertips adding abrasion to the enormous pressure he applies, so that your earlobe is not only crushed but also made raw and slightly bloody. You refuse to cry out, denying your torturer satisfaction, and thereby insuring that the punishment is prolonged.</p><p>Your teacher did not want to be a teacher. He wanted to be a meter reader at the electric utility. Meter readers do not have to put up with children, they work comparatively little, and, more important, they have greater opportunity for corruption and are hence both better off and held in higher regard by society. Nor was becoming a meter reader out of your teacher’s reach. His uncle worked for the electric utility. But the one position as meter reader this uncle was able to facilitate went, as all things most desirable in life invariably went, to your teacher’s elder brother.</p><p>So your teacher, who narrowly failed his secondary-school final examination but was able to have the results falsified, with his false results—plus a bribe equivalent to sixty per cent of one year’s prospective salary, and a good low-level connection in the education bureaucracy in the form of a cousin—secured the post he currently occupies. He is not exactly a man who lives to teach. In fact, he hates to teach. It shames him. Nonetheless, he retains a small but not nonexistent fear of losing his job, or, if not losing his job, then of being put in a position where he will be forced to pay yet another, and indeed larger, bribe in order to retain it, and this fear, augmented by his sense of abiding disappointment and his not unfounded conviction that the world is profoundly unfair, manifests itself in the steady dose of violence he visits upon his charges. With each blow, he tells himself, he helps education penetrate another thick skull.</p><p>Penetration and education, the two are intertwined in the lives of many around you. In the life of your sister, for example. She is sobbing when you return home. Lately, she alternates with alarming frequency between suppressed but globular tears and calm airs of smug superiority. At the moment, it is the former.</p><p>You say, “Again?”</p><p>“Sit on my dick, you little pussy.”</p><p>You shake your head. You are too tired to retort appropriately and, what’s more, too drained to be confident of dodging one of her quick-fire slaps.</p><p>She notices that something is wrong with you. She says, “What happened to your ear?”</p><p>“Teacher.”</p><p>“That sisterfucker. Come here.”</p><p>You sit beside her and she puts her arm around you, stroking your hair. You shut your eyes. She sniffles once or twice, but she is done crying for now.</p><p>You say, “Are you frightened?”</p><p>“Frightened?” She forces a laugh. “He should be frightened of me.”</p><p>The “he” she refers to is your father’s second cousin, a decade her senior, to whom she is now betrothed. His first wife recently died in childbirth<span data-page="page_5"></span> after two miscarriages, and no time has been wasted in arranging another match for him.</p><p>“Does he still have that mustache?” you ask.</p><p>“How should I know? I haven’t seen him in years.”</p><p>“It’s enormous, that mustache.”</p><p>“You know what they say about the size of a man’s mustache.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Never mind.”</p><p>“So are you frightened?”</p><p>“Of what?”</p><p>“I don’t know. Of leaving. I’d be scared to move back to the village all by myself.”</p><p>“That’s why you’re still a boy and I’m a woman.”</p><p>“You’re a girl.”</p><p>“No, I’m a woman.”</p><p>“A girl.”</p><p>“I bleed every month. I’m a woman.”</p><p>“You’re disgusting.”</p><p>“Maybe.” She smiles. “But a woman.”</p><p>Then she surprises you. She does something that you associate with women of girth and substance, not with slender slips of girls like her. She sings. She sings in a quiet and powerful voice. She sings a song that mothers in your village sing to their newborns, a song that your mother sang to each of you. It is like a lullaby but more upbeat, meant not to put an infant to sleep but, rather, to communicate a mother’s presence when a task takes her beyond touch or out of sight. You have not heard it in years. It feels strange to hear your sister sing it, oddly relaxing and unsettling at the same time. You lean against her as she sings, and you feel her body swell and diminish like a harmonium.</p><p>Your sister, firstborn, has worked as a cleaning girl since shortly after your family moved to the city, your father’s income unable to keep up with the rampant inflation of recent years. She was told that she could go back to school once your brother, the second of you three surviving siblings, was old enough to work. She demonstrated more enthusiasm for education in her few months in a classroom than your brother did in his several years. He has just been found employment as a painter’s assistant, and has been taken out of school as a result, but your sister will not be sent there in his stead. The time for that has passed. Marriage is her future. She has been marked for entry.</p><p>When your brother gets home he is exhausted, a fine white dusting of paint on the exposed skin of his hands and face. It is also on his hair, like a play actor’s makeup, and he resembles a boy about to go onstage as a middle-aged man in a school drama. He looks at you wearily and coughs.</p><p>Your sister says, “I told you, you shouldn’t smoke.”</p><p>He says, “I don’t smoke.”</p><p>She sniffs him. “Yes, you do.”</p><p>“The master does. I’m just around him all day.”</p><p>The truth is that your brother has smoked on several occasions. But he does not particularly like to smoke, and he has not smoked this week. Besides, smoking is not the reason for his cough. The reason for his cough is paint inhalation.</p><p>The painter your brother assists is an air-gun spray painter, and his work is in some senses like being an astronaut, or, slightly more prosaically, a scuba diver. It, too, involves the hiss of air, the feeling of weightlessness, the sudden pressure headaches and nausea, the precariousness that results when an organic being and a machine are fused together. Then again, an astronaut or an aquanaut sees unimaginable new worlds, whereas your brother sees only a monocolor haze of varying intensities.</p><p>His occupation requires patience and the fortitude to withstand a constant sense of low-level panic, both of which, out of necessity, your brother has acquired. In theory, it also requires protection in the form of goggles and respirators, but your brother and his master have neither. They place thin cotton rags over their mouths and noses instead. Hence, in the near term, your brother’s cough. Over the long term, consequences can be more serious. But a painter’s assistant is paid, the skills he learns are valuable, and, in any case, over sufficiently long a term, as everyone knows, there is nothing that does not have as its consequence death.</p><p>While your mother prepares dinner that evening, a lentil stew thickened with chunks of onion, not because onions are her favorite ingredient but because they appear to add substance to a meal and today in the market they were cheap, it may not seem that you are a lucky child. Your wounded ear is, after all, more visibly painful than the expression in your sister’s eyes or the residue of paint on your brother’s skin. Yet you are fortunate. Fortunate in being third-born.</p><p>There are forks in the road to wealth that have nothing to do with choice or desire or effort, forks that have to do with chance, and the order of your birth is one of these. Third means you are not heading back to the village. Third means you are not working as a painter’s assistant. Third also means you are not, like your parents’ fourth child, a tiny skeleton in a small grave at the base of a tree.</p><p>Your father comes home after you have eaten. He has his meals with the other servants at the house where he cooks. All of you crowd around the family television, a sign of your urban prosperity. It is powered by a wire of communally stolen electricity that runs down<span data-page="page_final"></span> the front of your building. It is archaic, a black-and-white, cathode-ray-tube device with an excessively curved and annoyingly chipped screen. It is narrower than the distance between your wrist and your elbow. And it is able to capture only the few channels that broadcast terrestrially. But it works, and your family watches in a state of hushed rapture the musical variety show it delivers to your room.</p><p>When the show ends, credits roll. Your mother sees a meaningless stream of hieroglyphs. Your father and sister make out an occasional number, your brother the occasional word. Third means your success is decoupling from that of your kin. For you alone does this part of the programming make sense. You understand that it reveals who is responsible for what.</p><p>The electricity to your neighborhood cuts out on the hour, and with it the light from your single naked bulb. A candle burns while you all prepare to turn in, and is then extinguished by your mother with a squeeze of her fingers. In the room it is now dim but not dark, the glow of the city creeping in through the shutters, and quiet but not silent. You hear a train decelerate as it passes along the tracks. You tend to sleep deeply, so although you share a cot with your brother, his cough does not disturb you even once during the night. ♦</p>	Mohsin Hamid	September 24, 2012 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/09/24/the-third-born	Brothers	Chance	Children	Class	Families	Gender	Reader	Second	Children
To the Moon and Back	<p>I celebrate the kid’s birthday the day after. Always the day after or the day before, never on the actual date. Always the same shit. Why? Because his honor the judge decided that the kid has to be with his mommy on his birthday, even if she’s a bitch and a liar who fucks every jerk who smiles at her at work. Daddy is less important.</p><p>Lidor and I go to the mall together, not for a present; the last time I was in a duty-free shop, I bought him a remote-control multicopter drone. Eighty-nine dollars—eighty-nine!—and they didn’t even put batteries for the remote in the box. So we’re going to the mall to pick up some batteries, but I tell Lidor that it’s to have fun. What <em>can</em> I tell him? Not only did Daddy bring his present a day late but he didn’t even check to see if there were batteries inside? No way.</p><p>The bitch. Yesterday I say to her, Let me come to the party, just for ten minutes. To give the kid a kiss, take a shot of him with my cell when he blows out the candles, and then I’ll leave. But she starts with the threats and the restraining orders, texts her boyfriend, the law clerk, while she’s on the line with me—I can actually hear her tapping—and says that if she sees me anywhere near the building she’ll make my life hell.</p><p>Lidor wants us to fly the drone first and then go to the mall, but there are no batteries in the remote, and I don’t want to tell him that, so I say, We’ll go to the big candy store on the third floor, the one with the SpongeBob SquarePants helium balloons and the lady with yellow teeth who yells, “Come in! Come in! Buy candy for the little boy,” and I’ll buy him another present there, whatever he wants.</p><p>Lidor says, The mall’s great, but first the drone. I lie to him, tell him that the mall closes early. Luckily for me, he’s still young enough to believe.</p><p>Three in the afternoon and the mall is packed. To be with him for his birthday, I had to take half a day off work. Judging by how mobbed the mall is, I must be the only person in this country who works. But Lidor, what a sweet kid, he laughs all the time, never whines, not even when we have to wait in line forever to get inside.</p><p>At the escalator, he wants to go up the down side, for the fun of it, and I go along with him. It’s a good workout for both of us. You have to run as fast as you can so you won’t be dragged down, have to strain the whole time not to fall on your ass. Just like in life. A hunchbacked old lady who is coming down tries to argue with us, asks why we don’t go up the regular way, like everyone else. She’ll be in her grave in another minute, and this is what bothers her? I don’t even answer her.</p><p>When we get to the candy store on the third floor, the lady with yellow teeth isn’t there, only a pimple-faced teen-ager, as thin as a chopstick. I say to Lidor, “Pick out whatever you want. But only one thing, O.K.? And whatever it is, even if it costs a million shekels, Daddy will buy it for you, promise. What does Lidor want?”</p><p>The kid is excited, walks around the store like a junkie in a pharmacy, looks at the shelves, picks things up, tries to decide. Meanwhile, I use the time to buy AAA batteries. Pimple-Face doesn’t ring them up on the register, even though I wave the money in front of him. “What are we waiting for?” I ask.</p><p>“For the kid to decide,” he says, and pulls a string of gum out of his mouth. “I’ll ring them up together.” And, before I can say anything, he starts playing with his cell.</p><p>“Do them separately, man,” I insist, shoving the batteries into the bag with the drone. “Before the kid comes over. It’s a surprise.” Pimple-Face rings them up, and the cash-register drawer springs open with a ding. He doesn’t have small bills to make change for me, so he loads me down with coins.</p><p>Just then, Lidor comes over. “What did you buy, Daddy?”</p><p>“Nothing,” I say. “Just some gum.”</p><p>“Where is it?” Lidor asks.</p><p>“I swallowed it.”</p><p>“But it’s bad to swallow gum,” he says. “It can stick to your stomach.”</p><p>Pimple-Face gives a stupid laugh.</p><p>“You want a present or what?” I say, changing the subject. “Come on, pick out something.”</p><p>“I want that,” Lidor says, pointing to the cash register. “So I can play with Yanir and Lyri, like we have a candy store.”</p><p>“They don’t sell the cash register,” I say. “Pick out something else.”</p><p>“I want the cash register,” Lidor persists. “Daddy, you promised.”</p><p>“I said to pick out something that’s for sale.”</p><p>“You’re a liar!” Lidor yells and kicks my leg as hard as he can. “Just like Mommy says. You’re all talk.”</p><p>The kick hurts, and, when something hurts me, I get pissed off. But today I manage to control myself. Because I love my son more<span data-page="page_2"></span> than anything else in the world, and today’s a special day, his birthday. I mean, the day after his birthday. The bitch.</p><p>“How much do you want for the cash register?” I ask Pimple-Face, as cool as can be.</p><p>“What are you, six years old?” he says with a crooked smile. “You know it’s not for sale.” He says “six years old” as if Lidor were a moron or something, and I realize now that he’s trapped me. I have to choose a side—either I’m with him or I’m with Lidor.</p><p>“A thousand shekels,” I say and extend my hand. “We shake on it now, and I go down to the A.T.M. and come back with the money.”</p><p>“It’s not mine,” he says, squirming. “I just work here.”</p><p>“So whose is it?” I ask. “The lady with yellow teeth?”</p><p>“Yes,” he says, nodding. “Tirza.”</p><p>“So get her on the phone,” I say. “Let me talk to her. For a thousand shekels, she can get a new register. A better one.”</p><p>Lidor looks at me like I’m some kind of a superhero. There’s nothing greater than to have your kid look at you that way. It’s better than a vacation in Thailand. Better than a blow job. Better than punching someone who has it coming. “Go ahead, call her,” I say and give him a little push. Not because I’m angry. For the kid.</p><p>He taps in the number and walks away from us, half whispering into the phone. I follow him wherever he goes, Lidor behind us. He looks happy. He was already happy earlier, when I picked him up, but now he’s flying.</p><p>“She says no,” Pimple-Face tells me and shrugs as if the word had come from God.</p><p>“Give her to me.” I gesture with my hand.</p><p>“She says stores don’t sell their cash registers,” he says. I grab the phone away from him. That makes Lidor laugh. Daddy’s making Lidor laugh.</p><p>“Tirza,” I say. “Hi, this is Gabi, a good customer of yours. You don’t recognize the name, but you’d know my face in a second. Listen, I need you to help me out here. A thousand shekels—you not only buy a new register, but I owe you a favor.”</p><p>“And where the fuck will we ring up the thousand?” Tirza asks on the other end of the line. She’s in a noisy place; I can hardly hear her.</p><p>“So you don’t ring it up,” I say. “What am I, the Tax Authority? A thousand shekels straight into your pocket. Come on, what do you say?”</p><p>“Put him on the phone,” she says impatiently.</p><p>“The teen-ager?” I ask.</p><p>“Yes,” Tirza says, starting to sound angry. “Put him on.”</p><p>I hand the phone to Pimple-Face. He talks to her for a minute, then ends the call. “She says no,” he tells me. “Sorry.”</p><p>Lidor takes my hand. “Cash register,” he says in his most serious voice. “You promised.”</p><p>“Two thousand,” I say to Pimple-Face. “Call her back and tell her I’ll give her two thousand, a thousand now and another thousand tomorrow.”</p><p>“But—” Pimple-Face starts.</p><p>“I can’t take out more than a thousand at a time,” I interrupt him. “I’ll bring the other thousand tomorrow morning. Don’t worry, I’ll leave you my driver’s license as a guarantee.”</p><p>“She told me not to call anymore,” he says. “She’s sitting shivah for her father. She doesn’t want to be disturbed.”</p><p>“Sorry for your loss,” I say, putting a consoling arm around his shoulder. “So think about it. Two thousand is a lot of money. If she finds out later that I offered it and you said no, she’ll tear you a new one. Listen to a grownup—it’s not worth getting into trouble over a small thing like this.”</p><p>I press the bottom of the cash-register drawer and, bam, it opens. It’s a trick I learned when I worked at the Burger Ranch, after the Army. “Take out the money,” I tell him, but he doesn’t move, so I collect the money for him and stick it into the front pocket of his jeans.</p><p>“Stores don’t sell their cash registers,” he says.</p><p>“Who cares,” I say. “Trust me, it’s a sweet deal. Wait here for me, and I’ll be back in five minutes with a thousand shekels so the bills in your pocket don’t get lonely.”</p><p>Before he can answer, I take Lidor by the hand and go down to the A.T.M. Sometimes the machine gives me problems, but today it spits out the thousand in blue two-hundred-shekel bills without arguing.</p><p>When we get back, a sweaty fat guy with a mustache is talking to Pimple-Face. I know him, he owns the frozen-yogurt stand next door. When Pimple-Face sees us come in, he points at me. I wink at him and put the thousand on the counter. “Here,” I say. Pimple-Face doesn’t move. “Come on, take it already! Lighten up!” I pick the bills up and try to shove them into his pocket.</p><p>“Leave him alone,” Fat Guy says. “He’s just a kid.”</p><p>“I can’t,” I say. “I promised my son. Today’s his birthday.”</p><p>“Happy birthday,” Fat Guy says and tousles Lidor’s hair without even looking at him. “Want some ice cream, buddy? A present from me—a cup of ice cream with whipped cream and chocolate syrup and gummy bears on top.” The whole time he’s<span data-page="page_final"></span> talking his small eyes stay fixed on me.</p><p>“I want the cash register,” Lidor says, moving away from him and pressing up against me. “Daddy promised.”</p><p>“What will you do with a cash register?” Fat Guy asks but doesn’t wait for an answer. “We have one, too, but only because the tax people make us use it. It’s not good for anything. It just makes noise. What do you say—let Daddy take you to the computer store on the second floor and buy you an Xbox instead. For a thousand shekels, you can get the best one, with Kinect and everything.”</p><p>I don’t say anything. I actually like the idea. It’ll save me a lot of trouble here, and later, too, with Lilia, when I take him back home. Because the minute Lilia sees the cash register, she’ll start carrying on.</p><p>“So what do you say?” Fat Guy asks Lidor. “Xbox is the best. Races, chases, whatever you want.”</p><p>“Cash register,” Lidor says, hugging my legs tightly.</p><p>“Look at what an angel he is,” I say and try to hand the money to Fat Guy. “Help me make him happy on his birthday.”</p><p>“It’s not my store,” Fat Guy protests. “I don’t even work here. I’m just trying to help—”</p><p>“But you’re not.” I move so close to him now that my face almost touches his.</p><p>“I have to go back to the store.” Fat Guy shrugs and says to Pimple-Face, “If he tries anything, call the police,” and leaves. A real hero.</p><p>I put the thousand shekels on the counter, unplug the register, and start rolling up the cord, and, when Lidor sees that, he claps his hands.</p><p>“I’m calling the cops,” Pimple-Face says, and begins punching in numbers. I grab the phone away from him again.</p><p>“Why?” I say. “It’s his birthday today. Everyone’s happy, don’t ruin it.” Pimple-Face looks at his phone, which is in my hand, then at me, and runs out of the store. I put Pimple-Face’s phone on the counter and pick up the register. “Now we’ll leave here fast,” I say to Lidor, my voice cheerful, as if this were a game. “We’ll go back home and show Mommy what you got.”</p><p>“No,” Lidor says, stamping his feet. “First we fly the helicopter and then we go home. You promised.”</p><p>“Yes,” I say in my gentlest voice. “But the cash register is heavy. Daddy can’t carry it and fly the helicopter at the same time. Now the register and tomorrow, right after school, we’ll go fly the helicopter in the park.”</p><p>Lidor thinks for a minute. “Now the helicopter,” he says. “And tomorrow the cash register.” And right then, just in time, Pimple-Face comes running back into the store with a security guard.</p><p>“What do you think you’re doing?” the guard says. He’s a short, hairy guy, looks more like a pinscher than like a security guard.</p><p>“Nothing.” I give him a wink and put the cash register back in place. “Just trying to make the kid laugh. It’s his birthday today.”</p><p>“Happy birthday, kid,” the guard says to Lidor, as if he couldn’t care less. “Many happy returns. But now you and your father have to leave.”</p><p>“Yes,” Lidor says. “We have to go and fly the helicopter.”</p><p>In the park, Lidor and I play with the multicopter drone. The brochure says that it can fly forty metres high, but after about fifteen metres it can’t pick up the signal from the remote, its propeller stops spinning, and it falls. Lidor likes that.</p><p>“Who loves Lidor the most in the world?” I ask, and Lidor answers, “Daddy!”</p><p>“And how much does Lidor love Daddy?” I ask while the multicopter drone spins around him, and he yells, “A whole bunch!”</p><p>“Up to the sky,” I shout. “Up to the moon and back!”</p><p>My cell starts vibrating in my pocket, but I ignore it. It must be Lilia. Above us, the drone is getting smaller and smaller. In another second, it’ll be out of our field of vision and will fall. Then we’ll both start running across the grass and try to catch it, and if Lidor beats me to it again he’ll laugh that killer laugh of his. There’s nothing nicer in this stinking world than the sound of a kid laughing. ♦</p><p><em>(Translated, from the Hebrew, by Sondra Silverston.)</em></p>	Etgar Keret	October 3, 2016 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/03/to-the-moon-and-back	Birthdays	Books	Childhood	Children	Fathers and Sons	Presents	Unnamed	First	Children
Upside-Down Cake	<p>Every visit to an aged parent is in the nature of a farewell. When I got a save-the-date postcard for Mother’s ninetieth, I thought, Oh, God. A birthday can seem like a kind of funeral. Then I saw an opportunity, and said yes, and made my arrangements, and looked forward to the event. But the private function room at the Happy Clam <em>was</em> funereal, with bouquets and long faces—Rose with her back turned, Gilbert and Fred conferring, Franny fussing over her son, Jonty. We all stood gaping and glassy-eyed, as though we were about to bury Mother.</p><p>I had arrived on time, resolved to see it through. The spouses were rattled—Franny’s husband, Marvin, ill at ease out of his security-guard uniform, Fred’s wife, Erma, sighing and snatching at her hair, Rose’s husband, Walter, monkeying with a camera as a way of snubbing everyone else. Jonty’s little girl, Jilly, was the center of attention, the adults shouting at her as she ran back and forth.</p><p>“Run to Granma! Run to Granma!” Jonty called out. “Jilly, listen to me!”</p><p>Mother recoiled as the child approached, then smiled slightly when Jilly tripped and fell. Jonty swept up Jilly, who began howling.</p><p>“I had a child named Angela,” Mother said. “She died. She’s in Heaven.”</p><p>“Granma is, I believe, the name of the official Cuban newspaper,” someone said very loudly. It was Floyd, in a black fedora, leaning on his tightly rolled umbrella. “I always found that terribly ironic. It was named after the yacht that brought the guerrillas to fight in the Cuban Revolution in 1956.”</p><p>“But why was the yacht called Granma?” Rose asked.</p><p>“Funnily enough, because the man who owned it, a gringo, had named it after his Granma. But you knew that, of course.”</p><p>“Jilly, tell me where it hurts, honey,” Jonty pleaded with the shrieking child.</p><p>“Who was it who said, ‘If you’re strong enough to scream, it can’t hurt that much’? ” Floyd said, winking at Mother and stepping past me to give her a kiss. “Was it you, Mother?”</p><p>This was the Floyd I remembered from happier days, the man who burned up the air in the room and left people gasping in the vacuum, the man who told me once, “Mother’s obsession with dead Angela is harmless enough. Think of Paul Verlaine’s mother. She kept her dead fetus—was it a pair of foeti?—in a bottle of alcohol for years, for the family to mourn.”</p><p>“We’re waiting for Hubby—oh, there he is,” Fred said, as Hubby appeared at the door. His wife, Moneen, hurried to the other spouses, the second tier of relations, in the cheap seats.</p><p>Franny handed Floyd a shopping bag. “Your favorite,” she said. Floyd picked through the bag, sorting fruit and candy, and held up a pink metal drum of Almond Roca.</p><p>“The trouble with them is I can’t open them fast enough,” Franny said.</p><p>“One would never have known that,” Floyd said, “to look at you.” He found something else, a cellophane bag. “Mixed nuts. That is so appropriate to this day of days.”</p><p>The triumph at such a family gathering lay in concealing your real feelings. But already this was unravelling.</p><p>“Maybe we could sit down,” Fred said, raising his arms. “Everyone’s here.”</p><p>Floyd began shaking nuts into his hand. “Why is it,” he said, as he rattled the nuts in his fist like dice before shooting them into his mouth, “that people always do this when they’re eating nuts?”</p><p>“I’m not sitting next to him,” Hubby said, and moved his place card down the table.</p><p>“Lovely shirt, Hubby,” Floyd said, chewing. “I always knew those were going to come back into style someday.”</p><p>“For the love of God,” someone muttered.</p><p>“The <em>placement</em>,” Floyd said, pronouncing the word the French way—<em>plassmon</em>—and fluttering his fingers at the place cards. “It’s worthy of the court of Versailles. ‘I know my place.’ ‘Who’s in, who’s out?’ ‘I won’t sit next to you.’ ”</p><p>“But there’s an extra place,” Marvin said.</p><p>Mother stared at him. He stammered and clutched his belt, as no doubt he did at the mall, one hand on his Taser, one on his Mace can.</p><p>“Mah-vin,” Franny said. Still an outsider, not one of us, after all these years, Marvin did not realize his mistake even when it was pointed out to him. This seemingly extra place was, of course, for Angela, who had been with us, guiding Mother, for fifty years, since dying at birth.</p><p>Fred and Gilbert sat on either side of Mother, Franny and Rose next to them, then Hubby, Jonty—Jilly on his lap—and the spouses, Marvin, Moneen, and Erma. Walter was snapping pictures. Floyd took his seat, and I sat next to him.</p><p>Floyd started to tug at my shirt. “This is—what, Jay? Shirred silk? Chiffon? I like its epicene <em>in-soo-shuntz</em>. Its diaphanous drape. Its hand.”</p><p>Mother sat like a queen, beaming over the motley crowd at the table. Seven years on from Father’s funeral, we all looked bigger but droopier, the same people wearing odder, older masks, all of us like large, misshapen children.</p><p>“How wonderful to have all my family here,” Mother said. “I’m so lucky.”</p><p>“We’re the lucky ones, Ma!” Franny said.</p><p>“Mumma, we’ve been looking forward to this,” Rose said.</p><p>Hubby said, “Will someone pass the bread?”</p><p>Floyd juggled a bread stick and said, “Are<span data-page="page_2"></span> you saying you’d like one of these up your end?”</p><p>Breathing hard with impatience, Hubby scowled. He said, “So, do we get menus?”</p><p>“Menu is, of course, the grandson of Brahma, and his law must be obeyed,” Floyd said. “One apposite law regarding temperance is ‘He must eat without distraction of mind.’ ”</p><p>“No menus. Fred chose the meal,” Mother said. “It’s simpler. We thought you’d prefer it that way.”</p><p>Mother said she was happy—and for once she seemed to be telling the truth. But her happiness was possible only because the rest of us were miserable. Looking around the room, I saw how shamefaced we seemed. We had betrayed one another too many times to be able to sit comfortably around the same table together. But Mother had prevailed; she had insisted on our being there, and had implied—as she often did—that if we coöperated there would be a reward for us in her will. She held out the prospect of her death to command our attention, yet she was the only person at the table who, small and sinewy, looked healthy, even indestructible. Just a glance told me that the rest of us would leave the table much angrier than before. So Mother had got her wish and was fulfilled in all the important ways—having her birthday party, receiving presents, and, with this large get-together, dividing us by creating more confusion.</p><p>“May I request a beverage?” Floyd said.</p><p>“Take your hat off,” Fred said.</p><p>“If you say the magic word,” Floyd said, removing his hat and spinning it on his finger. “A drink, ‘a beaker full of the warm South’ ”—he was leaning toward Jonty—“ ‘the blushful Hippocrene, with beaded bubbles winking at the brim.’ Source?”</p><p>Jonty turned away. Hubby set his face at him. Franny and Rose shrugged.</p><p>“You want Johnny Keats,” Floyd said, and raised a finger, reciting, “ ‘The dunces flutterblasting, with food-splashed faces’—a citation, if you please.”</p><p>Hubby said “Diet Coke” to the waiter.</p><p>“I think you’ll find that it was I who penned those words,” Floyd said, crossing his legs. “Why is it that your so-called diet drinks are the preference of the chubbies and the chunkies, as if some arcane magic attached . . . ”</p><p>“Shut up,” Hubby said.</p><p>The drinks were handed out, we toasted Mother, and the first course was served—clam chowder and soda crackers.</p><p>“Careful, hon,” Franny said to Marvin, “don’t season it.” She explained to the table, “He’s got acid reflux wicked bad. He’s on Zantac.”</p><p>“For the P.P.I.,” Marvin said, with the pedantry of a chronic sufferer. “Proton-pump inhibitors.”</p><p>“I seem to recall it was stool softeners,” Floyd said. “A bewitching pair of words. Like panty shields.”</p><p>When Marvin looked up, his chin thrust out like a claw hammer, Rose said, “It’s not funny. I’m on prednisone, Ma.”</p><p>Mother smiled like a cat and licked the chowder rim from the bristles above her lips.</p><p>“Has anyone here tried Ambien?” Gilbert said. “I’ve finally gotten a night’s sleep with it. Call it my drug of choice.”</p><p>“Walter’s on Paxil,” Rose said. “It seems to calm him down—doesn’t it, honey?—and helps him sleep.”</p><p>“I take, like, a ton of potassium,” Jonty said. “I’ve got a problem with electrolytes.”</p><p>“I love the gallant names,” Floyd said. “Ceedrex, for my liver and lights. I eat them like candy.”</p><p>“All I take is blood thinner,” Hubby said.</p><p>“What about that stuff to lower your cholesterol?” his wife said.</p><p>“And that—Lipitor.”</p><p>“What are you on, Ma?” Franny said, raising her voice, as we all did when addressing Mother.</p><p>“These people who take nitroglycerin for their heart,” Floyd said. “Why don’t they explode? And, by the way, in which novel does a character self-combust?”</p><p>“ ‘Bleak House,’ ” I said. “The rag-and-bone man, Krook. ‘Inborn, inbred, engendered in the corrupted humours of the vicious body itself.’ ”</p><p>“Isn’t education a wonderful thing?” Floyd said.</p><p>“What am I <em>on</em>?” Mother said, but did not speak again until all eyes shifted to her, as she sat glaring at Franny. When we had fallen silent, she said again, “What am I <em>on</em>?” She spoke loudly and became indignant. Her girlish shudder was studied and stagy. “I’m not <em>on</em> anything.”</p><p>Though we marvelled at Mother for taking no medication, it seemed to me that she was calling attention to her stoicism; mortification was her way of outdoing us in our maladies.</p><p>“There is no medicine for what I have,” Mother said, her fingers stroking the skin flaps of her scrawny throat.</p><p>“Mumma!” Franny cried, as though summoning her.</p><p>“Old age is incurable.” Mother half closed her eyes. “My bags are packed.”</p><p>“Please don’t, Mumma,” Rose said, whinnying a little.</p><p>Gilbert placed a reassuring arm around Mother, who wore an expression of quiet suffering.</p><p>Marvin whispered to Jonty, “You gonna finish the rest of that chowda?”</p><p>The spouses were flustered. In his confusion, Walter was still walking around the long table, his head bowed over his viewfinder, snapping pictures of us.</p><p>“Why don’t we all take turns telling our happy memories?” Fred said. “Of Ma. Way back when.”</p><p>Mother closed her eyes completely. She seemed to be lying in state as the meal became a proper funeral, with valedictions and reminiscences, Mother in the place of honor among the flowers, looking thwarted and doll-like, as the dead do, her skinny fingers twisted in her green shawl.</p><p>“Like when<span data-page="page_3"></span> we had that creamy oatmeal,” Hubby said, “that was never lumpy. Yum-yum.”</p><p>“My favorite was the al-dente pasta,” Rose said. “With the Bolo sauce.”</p><p>“Both were thewy and farinaceous,” Floyd said, tearing at a piece of bread. “And what was that witches’ brew we had on Saturday nights, with the crunchy undercooked onion? And the fatty meat—that was the best part!”</p><p>“Pea soup,” Franny said. “Kidney stew.”</p><p>“Dad’s favorite,” Mother said. She was deaf to irony. Believing that her cooking was being praised, her eyes puddled, she began to cry. She dabbed at her eyes. “I tried so hard to please you.”</p><p>Floyd said, “Pot roast. Baked chicken. Fork tender.”</p><p>“The way you put crunched-up potato chips on your fish casserole is what I used to like,” Rose said. “I do that for my Walter.”</p><p>“Ma made her own rolls,” Hubby said. “No one does that anymore. Home-baked and fluffy.”</p><p>“Parker House rolls,” Mother said.</p><p>“Your pineapple upside-down cake,” Gilbert said. “You put a cherry in the middle of each pineapple slice. The top was on the bottom, kind of a metaphor.”</p><p>“My favorite,” Mother said.</p><p>“And <em>bœuf en daube</em>,” Floyd said, “a splash of brandy and a lovely Côtes du Rhône in the pot, served with baby carrots, lightly sautéed morel mushrooms, the pancetta, the bouquet garni, the white truffles, just a hint of tarragon.”</p><p>“Don’t be a jerk,” Fred said.</p><p>“I have all Ma’s recipes,” Franny said.</p><p>“Sure you do,” Hubby said. The flecks of chowder in the corners of his mouth made him seem more menacing.</p><p>The sarcasm about Mother’s food thickened the air with frank hostility. We disapproved of the way we were behaving; we were childish and insincere. None of us wanted to be there, so we were spoiling it, and as we did the main course was served. Broiled scallops, mashed potatoes, coleslaw, and for each person an ear of corn in its own trough-shaped dish.</p><p>“I can’t eat,” Mother said, her face slackening.</p><p>“Are you upset, Ma?” Franny said.</p><p>Jonty said, “Just take a bite for Daddy,” to his daughter, poking at her face with a spoonful of potato.</p><p>“Bay scallops,” Marvin said, but pronounced it the off-Cape way, instead of rhyming it with “wallop,” and we all stared at him.</p><p>“You always wonder, Which bay?” Floyd said. “But I happen to know. It is, of course, a species and not any specific bay! Your anthropologists will tell you that communal eating is a grand gesture of harmony. We are partaking, therefore we are in accord, and all our ill will is behind us, our—dare I say?—motiveless malignity.”</p><p>Mother’s eyes were shut, her expression meditative, slightly sunken. No one responded to Floyd. We went on eating. The conversation became milder, brittle with forced politeness. The more correct we were, the more obviously hostile.</p><p>“May I have a piece of bread?”</p><p>“You <em>may</em> have a piece of bread.”</p><p>That sort of thing. This went on for a while, and then the table was cleared, the cake brought in and placed before Mother. The waitresses seemed harassed and incompetent, teen-age girls with untidy hair. “Enjoy,” one of them said.</p><p>“An expression I deplore for its being a grammatical goofball,” Floyd said. And to Jonty, “A solecism, as you might put it.”</p><p>Mother smiled at the slumping, soggy cake, topped with eight lurid pineapple slices, most of them with a cherry in the middle, two with candles, and, on the sloping side, “<em class="small">MOTHER</em>” spelled out in shaky worm-cast piping, with scrolls and roses around it.</p><p>“Make a wish, Ma,” Franny said. “Pineapple upside-down cake. Your favorite.”</p><p>But Mother had begun to look past us. “Hello?” she said, as though answering the telephone.</p><p>I followed Mother’s gaze and saw, at the door of the room, just entering, Charlie and Julie, and little Patrick asleep in Julie’s arms. The moment they arrived, the temperature in the room went down, the silence and the stillness shadowing forth a chill.</p><p>I stood up and said, “Let me introduce everyone.” When I turned back to the table I saw puzzled, unwelcoming faces—crouching savages, staring at outsiders who had invaded their jungle feast. “This is Charlie, his wife, Julie. And Patrick.”</p><p>“Dead to the world,” Charlie said. “Long ride!”</p><p>No one spoke. Mother straightened in her chair and looked resentful, for the attention had been taken from her. Hubby and the others shifted in their seats. As though sensing the bewilderment, Jilly began to bawl. Little Patrick’s eyes fluttered at the squawk, seeming to recognize the child’s complaint, like a common language.</p><p>“Let me get you chairs,” I said.</p><p>“How about this one?” Charlie seized a chair back.</p><p>Someone snorted. “No, no,” I said. “That’s Angela’s.”</p><p>“She in the john?” Charlie said.</p><p>“She’s in Heaven,” Mother said.</p><p>I found some folding chairs stacked in the corner. Charlie helped me set them up, a second row behind me. No one else moved or spoke.</p><p>“Blow out your candles, Mumma,” Rose said.</p><p>The candles had melted and dripped and charred the flesh of the pineapples, but still the orange flames swayed.</p><p>“Here goes,” Mother said.</p><p>“Her ninetieth,” Marvin explained to Charlie, who had drawn his chair nearer the table so that he could see better. Julie held their sleepy child. Their presence delighted me.</p><p>Everyone at the table had gone silent, not knowing how to handle the abrupt<span data-page="page_4"></span> entrance of these intruders at Mother’s birthday party. They had stumbled upon our secret ritual and might have overheard us in our mumblings and chants. And, because I had introduced them, the hostility was directed at me. I was glared at more than Charlie.</p><p>“Take a group picture, Walter,” I said.</p><p>“What about Angela?” Charlie said, gesturing to the empty chair. He must not have heard when Mother had said that Angela was in Heaven. Mother shut her eyes and suffered a little, as Franny and Rose gave Charlie dark looks.</p><p>After the upside-down cake had been cut and apportioned, Walter obliged with a family portrait. Floyd stood at the rear and, just before Walter snapped, exclaimed, “The House of Atreus!”</p><p>I knew my family’s moods from the pulses in the air, the barometric pressure, a certain unmistakable whiff and wrinkle of sound, and I could tell that they resented these strangers’ sharing in the photograph, taking up space with their smiles.</p><p>“Jay is something of a fop, but we forgive him his pretensions and his résumé inflation,” Floyd said to Charlie. “He’s the objective correlative by which we assess our plausibility. Let’s face it”—we were still posing, Walter still snapping—“he has made some questionable choices. But in his mind he is the sane one, and we are grotesques.”</p><p>“Give it a break,” Fred said. “Ma has a headache.”</p><p>But family needling was a form of congeniality, and Floyd was being friendly. I took his teasing as a peacemaking gesture.</p><p>“Floyd’s choices have been irreproachable,” I said, and Floyd laughed.</p><p>“It’s nice of you to have us,” Charlie said, glancing at Mother, who stared at him. “Especially on this big day.”</p><p>“Ya welcome,” Rose said out of the corner of her mouth.</p><p>As though dismissing Charlie and Julie, Fred said, “Want seconds on the upside-down cake?”</p><p>Coffee was served by the harassed waitresses, but by then the family members had got to their feet, yawning, making grunts of farewell, mutters of apology, shufflings of departure. With the arrival of Charlie, the birthday had come apart, and only a residue, a faint echo of the meal remained. The hostility had leaked away, leaving—what? Confusion, collapse, for ill will had held us together and now there was simply indifference.</p><p>“Stick around,” I said. “We can talk.”</p><p>But no one lingered; no one gave Charlie a second glance.</p><p>“Charlie owns a software company in Boston,” I said. “Ma, Charlie was looking forward to meeting you.”</p><p>But Mother was being helped out of the room by Gilbert, and Fred pointed his finger at his head and made a face, meaning “headache.”</p><p>When we were alone in the room, Charlie said, “Sorry, did we break up the party?”</p><p>“No, of course not,” I said. As I spoke he gave me a hug, and little Patrick said, “Who’s that man?”</p><p>Everyone in the big, porous, leaky family complained about Mother’s birthday party afterward, whispering heavily into the phone, even Mother—guest of honor, recipient of presents—who’d had a good time.</p><p>“I can’t believe that Jonty had the nerve to bring that daughter of his,” Mother said to me, when I visited. “Who ever gave him permission to do that? And where was Loris—isn’t that supposed to be his wife’s name?”</p><p>I was surprised by Mother’s fierceness, excessive even for her. She grew hoarse in her indignation and choked slightly—<em>hlook! hlook!</em>—a bone-in-the-throat gasping that always got my attention, even when I despaired of the naggy emphasis of her ham acting.</p><p>“Jonty should have known better. I specifically said, <em>no children.</em>”</p><p>Child-hating was not a pretense for Mother, the jokey exasperation of a sentimental woman, who spoke of her children insincerely as rug rats and burdens. She had already raised seven of them, plus the ghost of Angela—why more? Children bored her, they irritated her, they were always in the way. Worst of all, they took attention away from her.</p><p>“And only the immediate family,” she said.</p><p>Then I knew what this was about. In this outburst of criticism, Mother was, of course, reprimanding me for inviting Charlie and Julie and little Patrick to the family event. This was how she stirred: criticism was always oblique.</p><p>Mother said, “Who did Jonty think was paying for that party?”</p><p>“I forgot to ask—aren’t we sharing it?”</p><p>“I paid for it with my own money!” Mother said, screeching like a child shaking an empty piggy bank.</p><p>I watched her for a while and then said, “Maybe I shouldn’t have invited Charlie.”</p><p>Mother said, “He seemed very nice. I didn’t mind his being there. I’m sorry I didn’t get a chance to talk with him.” The noncommittal way she rolled the bones in her shoulders told me otherwise. The bones said, Why are you putting me through this by saying that?</p><p>“No one said much to them.”</p><p>Seizing this with a jeering laugh, Mother said, “We were there for another reason, Jay. You can’t just show up and expect people to be at your beck and call.”</p><p>“But they had a good time. They liked meeting the family.”</p><p>Mother smiled unpleasantly. “The little one came back for a second piece of upside-down cake.”</p><p>A day or so later, Franny confirmed my suspicions.</p><p>“Ma was kinda put out by your friends,” Franny said.</p><p>“They didn’t eat much.”</p><p>“They had an awful lot of cake.”</p><p>Criticizing a three-year-old for eating<span data-page="page_5"></span> cake was so preposterous I could not think of a reply. I hoped my silence would shame Franny. But she persisted.</p><p>“Hubby had seconds of chowder. And three big hunks of cake, a pineapple slice on each one.”</p><p>“Is that a problem?”</p><p>“I’m just saying. I’m kinda worried about his health. He has issues. And he’s always been heavy.”</p><p>Another family irony was that the target of one person’s criticism was often the critic of his accuser, and the complaint was usually identical. Franny said that Hubby was fat and greedy, and then covered it with this insincerity about his health; Hubby returned the compliment.</p><p>“Franny really stuffed herself,” he said to me the next day. “And she’s a blimp.”</p><p>When, a few days later, Rose found fault with Fred—“wicked bossy bastard, playing God with the menu”—I knew that Fred would have a reply, and he did: “Her pushy husband sticking his camera in my face. And she’s getting so manipulative.”</p><p>My phone kept ringing, and always it was a brother or a sister carping about another brother or sister. The subject was Mother’s birthday party, what a bad idea it had been, what a failure. And the soggy upside-down cake!</p><p>“At least Ma had a good time,” I said.</p><p>“She was upset by all the little children,” Fred said.</p><p>Two children—one of them my guest. No one dared criticize me to my face, which meant that behind my back they were buzzing, all of them angry with me.</p><p>All Charlie said afterward was “Thanks for having us. What an amazing family, even if it’s a little scary. But I’m so happy to have a real grandmother.”</p><p>In all this rancor, a voice that was generous.</p><p>The biggest surprise to me at Mother’s birthday party was Floyd—that he showed up was something of a miracle, but that was not all. His bearishness and his way of flaunting his scholarship were immutable aspects of his personality. What I had not expected was the energy and inventiveness of his incessant fooling. Though you had to have grown up in the family to appreciate the nuances of it, his teasing had been a compliment, the nearest thing there was in this family to a hug.</p><p>Walter sent everyone a set of pictures. Most of them were generic snapshots of us eating—faces chewing, busy arms—or of Mother posing with Fred and Gilbert, then with Franny and Rose. Hubby was shown sneaking a second helping of cake. Jonty’s daughter, Jilly, looked ghoulish, like a furious dwarf in a folktale, her face smeared with resinous yellow icing. One of Mother—amazing how merciless the camera is—made her look like a Roman matriarch, one of those poisoners and plotters. From the snapshots, ours was clearly a heavy family, with balding men, pot-bellied women, hunched joylessly with fixed expressions, only Mother exulting.</p><p>The best picture, one I had hoped for and treasured, showed us all, with Charlie and Julie in front, little Patrick on Charlie’s knee. I was crouched next to them. Mother was right behind them, affecting a pose of superiority in the way she leaned back, the better to be seen.</p><p>This was my prize. I had the photograph enlarged, so as to give it the formality of a portrait. Then I wrote a little note and made multiple copies of it:</p><p>I am enclosing a picture taken at Mother’s birthday party, which shows my son, Charlie, his wife, Julie, and my grandson, Patrick. You may remember that he was born in 1961 and put up for adoption. He has recently come into my life and is a part of my family. I omitted to mention this on the day.</p><p>This I sent to everyone. It was a dig, of course. They had not deserved to be told who he was. They had blamed me when he was born, had never inquired about him, had forgotten about him. At the party, as an anonymous stranger—but a cheery soul—he had been ignored. Yet here he was with a name, my flesh and blood, prosperous and happy, with an obvious family resemblance. I wondered what they would say.</p><p>Mother was the first to call. She was at once combative, cross that she had been upstaged. “Why didn’t you tell me?”</p><p>As a stranger, Charlie had excited no interest; as my long-lost son, he was sought after.</p><p>“No one talked to him,” I said.</p><p>“We didn’t know him.”</p><p>“You were angry that I invited him.”</p><p>“How was I to know he was your son?”</p><p>“That’s the point. He was a guest, obviously someone close to me. You thought he ate too much. Afterward, when I mentioned him, you said to me, ‘You can’t just show up and expect people to be at your beck and call.’ ”</p><p>“I never said that. I am a warm and hospitable woman, who would never send a helpless person from my door.”</p><p>“Charlie has a lovely house. He owns a big company.”</p><p>“Where does he live?”</p><p>“I’d rather not say.”</p><p>“I want to write to him.”</p><p>“He’s thirty-eight years old. Isn’t it a bit late for a letter?”</p><p>“I’m his grandmother!”</p><p>“You were angry when he was born. You said I should be ashamed. You never went to see him at Mass General.”</p><p>Snorts on the phone indicated that Mother had begun to cry.</p><p>“Want to hear the funny part?” I said.<span data-page="page_final"></span></p><p>Sobbing, she sounded to me as if she were swallowing soup, gulping it.</p><p>“I want to send him a little something,” Mother said.</p><p>“That’s the funny part,” I said. “He’s a multimillionaire.”</p><p>“Jay,” Mother said, moaning with regret. “You can be so cruel.”</p><p>Fred called. He said, “You made me feel like a fool. You didn’t say anything about him.”</p><p>“I left it up to you. It was a test of initiative. You failed, Freddy. Everyone failed. Ma failed.”</p><p>“She called me. She told me you insulted her. She’s a wreck.”</p><p>I had no sooner put the phone down than Franny called.</p><p>“I had a feeling,” Franny said. “I thought he looked like you. I knew all along. I didn’t want to say anything.”</p><p>Rose didn’t call. Gilbert sent me a postcard from Bahrain. Hubby said, “I was just a little kid when he was born. As Dad would say, it’s ancient history.”</p><p>Floyd sent me a postcard with an enigmatic image on it, a painting by Goya titled “Perro Semihundido en la Arena,” “Dog Half-Submerged,” a dark study of a little mutt buried up to its ears in sand, its snout upturned, its eyes imploring, under a big smoky-yellow sky. His message: “I think this just about sums it up.”</p><p>Not wishing to let him have the last word, I replied with a postcard of my own, a more hopeful one, Poussin’s painting of Moses discovered in the bulrushes, and wrote, “Or this.” ♦</p>	Paul Theroux	June 27, 2016 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/06/27/upside-down-cake-by-paul-theroux	Adoption	Awkwardness	Books	Cake	Children	Fathers	Unnamed	First	Children
We Didn’t Like Him	<p>We <span data-page="page_1"></span>didn’t like him. Manshu was fourteen, and we were eight or ten, and, instead of playing with boys his own age, he forced himself into our games. Often, he came out into the lane and, if we were playing stick-stick, he’d say, “Give me the stick.” Intimidated, we’d hand it over.</p><p>The lane had three- and four-story houses on both sides, so closely pressed together that the alley was always in shade. Once, we were playing cricket in the lane, Manshu batting. Nobody could get him out. The boy who was bowling, an eight-year-old, became angry and flung the ball away. Manshu twisted the boy’s arm behind his back, forcing him to his knees. Then he gently tapped the top of the boy’s head with the cricket bat, as if the boy were a wicket being driven into the ground.</p><p>Manshu was large, dark-skinned, round-faced. He was my father’s sister’s husband’s sister’s son. Since he belonged to my aunt’s husband’s family, we had to show him the respect due to a family that takes a daughter away. The fact that I had to show deference was one more reason that he irritated me. And, because I was related to Manshu, the other boys treated me badly. They blamed me for his behavior, as if my family were responsible for whatever he was doing.</p><p>Manshu’s father had died when he was six. He lived with his mother in a large room on the second floor of an old house. The room had a high ceiling and blue-green walls. The nicest thing about it was the swing that hung from the center of the ceiling.</p><p>Manshu’s mother had diabetes and got tired easily. Many evenings, after she had gone to bed, Manshu would visit our house. When he came, he paid no attention to me. Instead, he addressed himself to my parents. He had a way of speaking that suggested that he understood other people’s motivations. “Uncle,” he said to my father once, “you know what Mrs. Kohli is like.” When he spoke as if he knew things, I would think, Who are you to talk this way? Because I was eight and cruel, the way children are, I also thought, Why do you think you can talk when you don’t even have a father?</p><p>My parents belonged to a generation that is mostly gone now, those very formal men and women who measured distance with <em>kos</em> and counted change in annas. When Manshu visited, my mother made him sherbet and presented it to him on a tray, the way she would have served it to an adult toward whom the family had to show respect.</p><p>My parents were polite with Manshu, but periodically they showed that they found him irritating, too. Once, my mother told my father that everything Manshu said was probably an echo of something his mother had uttered. Another time, when Manshu passed seventh standard and his mother went around the lane giving out boxes of sweets, my father said, “Surely he must have cheated.”</p><p>Manshu’s mother was always fainting. She would pass out in the lane, and some neighbor would come and hold a glass of glucose water to her lips until she got up again. One day, when Manshu was sixteen, she fainted in the alley, but this time she didn’t get up.</p><p>For a while after she died, I did not believe that she was actually gone. A mother dying was the sort of thing that happened only in movies. I somehow imagined that Manshu’s mother would come back in a few weeks, and that she would be angry when she returned. She would accuse everyone of disloyalty for having thought she could die.</p><p>Not long after her death, I went to Manshu’s room with my parents. It smelled as it always had, of medicines and rubbing alcohol, of incense and cooking spices. I was disturbed by the fact that nothing had changed. It seemed confirmation that a horrible thing could occur and it would not matter. If Manshu’s misfortune could be ignored, then I, too, might suffer misfortune and be treated this way. I got scared. I wanted to leave so badly that I did not care if I hurt Manshu’s feelings.</p><p>Manshu was handed over to my aunt’s husband, who lived a few lanes away, but he continued to spend time in our lane. At first, I was embarrassed whenever I saw him. He was quiet, meek. He appeared chastened. His hunched shoulders would remind me that his mother was dead, and then I’d feel ashamed of my own good fortune.</p><p>Now, at our cricket games, if he batted for a while and nobody could get him out, he would surrender the bat and let somebody else take a turn. This thoughtfulness was due, perhaps, to the fact that his uncle did not like him; Manshu must have felt that he had no one to take care of him, and so he was afraid of offending. It may also have sprung from the tenderness we all feel when someone we love dies.</p><p>At some point, Manshu began to visit the temple in our lane. The temple was narrow, with a marble-floored courtyard that had idols along all four sides and a tulsi bush in the center. In a larger temple, Manshu might have been able to sit quietly without attracting<span data-page="page_2"></span> attention, but Gaurji, the pandit, who lived on the second floor of the temple, saw it as his home. He did not like people to be there, except for prayers. To Gaurji, they were intruding in his house. He would glower at the women who wanted to do service and came in the morning to wash the temple floor. He was irritable and slightly paranoid, as many pandits are, feeling underpaid and not respected.</p><p>Manshu, because he was spending so much time at the temple, began to join Gaurji at each prayer. There were prayers in the morning, the afternoon, the evening, and the night. During these, he sat right behind Gaurji. When Gaurji, bare-chested and skinny, his white dhoti wrapped around his narrow waist, rang his bell and blew on his shell, Manshu’s high wavery voice stood out.</p><p>My father was part of the committee that oversaw the temple, and Gaurji, of course, found it suspicious that somebody related to my father was spending so much time there, watching him. Once, Manshu asked to look at the prayer books and Gaurji began hitting him, slapping his face and shoulders. “What do you want?” he shouted. “At last, tell me what you want.”</p><p>Manshu began to be religious. He was now seventeen or so. He stopped playing with us and started wearing sandalwood paste on his forehead. When he met somebody on the street, he said, “Ram, Ram,” instead of “Namaste,” to show his piety.</p><p>Manshu’s religiosity became commonly known. Some women did their afternoon and evening prayers at home and liked to have another person present, because they felt that it would be more flattering to God to have two people praying than one. Manshu began to visit these women and sit before their altars as they sang. They would give him tea and crackers. My father found this embarrassing, as if Manshu were praying in exchange for food.</p><p>Manshu also bought some pamphlets on fortune-telling and astrology and started reading palms. He practiced, at first, on us children. We sat a step below him in the stairways of houses in the lane, our hands outstretched. When he read mine, I asked him whether I would be famous. “No,” he said. This made me doubt that he could forecast the future.</p><p>He told me that I would own a dog and have problems with my knees.</p><p>Manshu did not do well in higher secondary. He wasn’t able to get into college and so began studying for his B.Com. through correspondence school. He graduated in 1988. It is hard now to believe how difficult it was to get a job in India before 1991 and the economic liberalization. People would graduate from college, even good colleges, and remain unemployed for three or four years. Manshu became a tutor and continued to live with his uncle.</p><p>I didn’t do especially well in higher secondary, either. I did get into law school, but it was a Hindi medium one, rather than one taught in English. While I was in law school, I came home regularly. It was strange to see Manshu still wandering the lanes, still going into people’s homes to pray with them. He had grown a potbelly and he had a little Brahman ponytail now. He wore slippers, instead of shoes, as if he had to keep removing his footwear to enter sacred spaces. So much was changing in my life and so little in his that I began to see Manshu as simpleminded.</p><p>The difference between the late eighties and the mid-nineties was so great that it was as if there were decades separating them. When Manshu graduated from college, everyone wanted a government job. When I graduated from law school, everyone wanted to work for a foreign company. I was not smart enough to get a job with a multinational, so I opened an office near the courts in Tis Hazari. It was a tin-roofed shed in a lane of tin-roofed sheds that were rented by lawyers. During the day, I’d walk up and down the alleys, past tea stands and men sitting on stools beneath trees, typewriters before them. I talked to other lawyers—the fortunate ones in black gowns who were going to appear before a judge, and the rest, who, like me, wore dress pants and white shirts with pens in their breast pockets and their business cards rubber-banded in their pants pockets.</p><p>When I moved into the Tis Hazari office, I had a prayer ceremony performed in the shed. Manshu sat in the center of the concrete room and lit a fire, and soon the place was full of smoke and it was hard to breathe. Still, I sat there and sang prayers. Why not, if it might bring luck? Also, inviting the other lawyers in the lane to the prayer ceremony was a way of getting to know people.</p><p>To cultivate business, I began helping my father with his volunteer work, which was how I started dealing with the committee that oversaw the temple.</p><p>No pandit ever wants to leave a temple. It provides free housing and reasonable pay for not much effort. Also, one has an almost complete monopoly over the ceremonies held in nearby houses, and this can double or triple one’s income. But Gaurji suffered a series of small strokes, and they made him even angrier.<span data-page="page_3"></span> One winter evening, during prayers in the temple courtyard, he took the plates of food that had been put before the various gods for their dinner and began throwing them at the people who were seated cross-legged waiting for the prayers to start. I was there when this occurred. He called us sisterfuckers and ass-sniffers. He stood before us, so angry that he was trembling. His eyes were dilated. I have only once or twice seen someone possessed and, watching Gaurji, I had the same sense of astonishment that I had when I witnessed a woman at Nizamuddin Dargah holding on to the marble <em>jali</em>, shouting, “Mercy, mercy,” as people chanted nearby.</p><p>Gaurji’s youngest son wanted to replace his father; like me and Manshu, he had done poorly in school. My father wanted to give the position to Manshu. He and the temple committee went to the temple and told the son that Manshu was going to be the new pandit.</p><p>The next morning, when the two old women who washed the temple floor arrived, the building’s blue wooden doors were chained from the inside, the chains clanking whenever they tried to push them open.</p><p>The doors remained chained for several days. People walked past and said angry things, before touching the temple steps and then bringing their hands to their foreheads.</p><p>Eventually, to drive out Gaurji and his family, we had to turn off the water and the electricity.</p><p>Almost immediately after he became pandit, Manshu got married.</p><p>He used to go on pilgrimages to Vaishno Devi three times a year. He returned from one of these with a non-Brahman girl. He came back at night, entering the lane on foot, because an auto-rickshaw’s rattle would have drawn too much attention. He must have been ashamed, because he told no one in advance about the marriage and, even the next day, he did not visit us or his uncle to announce the news.</p><p>The girl was Vaishya—her family sold firewood and coal—and this upset my father. He sat on a chair in our courtyard, his pajamas rolled up to his knees to sun his legs. “Always in his heart, I sensed there was selfishness,” he said. “Now he’s going to turn the temple into a business.”</p><p>I tried to calm him. “I am a Brahman, and I am as business-minded as a Vaishya,” I said.</p><p>I went to the temple to see Manshu. I agreed with my father that Manshu had behaved dishonestly, that he should have told us of his intention to marry out of caste before we made him pandit, but I was used to dealing with conflict by then, and I went calmly.</p><p>Manshu and I sat in one of the small rooms on the second floor, a low-ceilinged room that was like a cell.</p><p>“I knew you would not be angry,” he said quickly, as if to preëmpt whatever I might say.</p><p>“How can I be angry at your happiness?” I asked. I did not care that Manshu had married out of caste. It was awkward, though, that he had done this so soon, while everyone in the lane was still aware of how much my family had done to support him.</p><p>“Meet your sister-in-law,” he said, and called out, “Aruna.”</p><p>The woman who came through the door was short and round and fair-skinned. She looked like a Russian nesting doll. I got up and went and touched her feet. She gave a surprised laugh at being treated so formally. “Will you have tea?” she said.</p><p>Before I could answer, Manshu spoke. “She has diabetes, just like Ma.” He was smiling, and he said this almost proudly. His pride struck me as odd, and being reminded of his mother took me aback. Since I no longer thought of her, it had not occurred to me that his mother continued to be real to him.</p><p>After this, I treated Manshu and his wife the way I would a business contact. I dropped by the temple in the evenings to say hello. I made sure to tell people to use Manshu for prayer ceremonies, and I let him know that I had made the suggestion.</p><p>My father’s suspicions about Manshu’s plans for the temple turned out to be correct. One day, Manshu came to my office. “How can I get on TV?” he asked, sitting on the other side of my desk. He wanted to be one of the yogis or miracle workers who are always on the cable channels. I said I guessed that you had to have a connection with someone who worked for the cable channels. He asked if I knew anyone like that. I did not.</p><p>Manshu then put an ad in the <em>Times of India</em>, a small box at the bottom of one of the middle pages, in which he claimed that praying at his temple might cure cancer. My mother said that he should go to jail. My father did not speak, only glowered.</p><p>For a few weeks, people came into the lane holding the cutout ad, asking for the temple.</p><p>I visited Manshu one evening soon after the ad came out and asked him how effective it had been. We were standing in the temple courtyard. “You need a lot of money to make advertising work,” Manshu said. “One or two ads is not enough.” He said this<span data-page="page_4"></span> angrily, as if his not having enough money for a lot of ads were some kind of injustice.</p><p>He put another ad in the <em>Times of India</em>. This time, when people came to the temple courtyard with the cutout ad, he performed miracles. He had learned some magic tricks and did such things as hold out an open palm before the visitor, close it, and then open it again to reveal blessed ashes.</p><p>Although the ads did not get him consistent new worshippers, they did help, in that he began to be asked to perform prayer ceremonies outside the neighborhood. The mere fact that he had been mentioned in the newspaper made him appear famous, and people liked to have somebody famous pray for them.</p><p>The worst thing that Manshu did, in my eyes as well as in my father’s, was start a small phone business at the end of the lane. Near the mouth of the lane, where it merged into a commercial street, were several shops, each about the size of a closet. One of these belonged to the temple. Originally, there had been an idol there, so that people could pray on their way out of the lane to start their day. Gaurji, however, had convinced the temple committee that he needed more money, and his son had begun selling various knickknacks from there. Now Manshu put a phone in the closet and a curtain across it so that boys and girls who wanted to make friendship calls but did not want to use their cell phones could use the booth. It was improper for a pandit to be involved in this kind of business, but even worse was the fact that it was Manshu’s wife who ran it. When a customer was in the booth, Aruna would come out into the lane and chatter with the other stall owners. She was popular with them for her willingness to be ordinary, but many of us felt that she was giving our lane a bad name.</p><p>In those days, Manshu only rarely came to our house. He was busy and had a wife he wanted to spend time with. My father, who did not actually want to see him, began to view his not visiting as disrespectful. It is hard to be around someone who has strong opinions without being influenced by those opinions. I, too, started to feel that Manshu was abusing us. It occurred to me that he had tricked us, that he had taken advantage of our family relationship to become the pandit, and then had turned the temple into a business. I continued to see Manshu regularly, though, just as I continue to do business with people who strike me as immoral.</p><p>When my father was sixty-seven, the doctors told him that he had cancer. He went into the hospital for an operation, came out, and then had to go in again. He had chemotherapy, which caused his hair and his teeth to fall out. He became frail. His skin turned red, as if it were burned. Sometimes I sponge-bathed my father in his bed at home, patting him with a handkerchief, because a towel was too rough. Even the handkerchief could cause his skin to peel and bleed.</p><p>Near the end, he developed a lung infection. When I told him that I had to take him back to the hospital, he started to cry. “Why? What purpose will that serve?” he said, weeping.</p><p>I wanted him to go on living, though, so I told him that he was worrying for no reason. Because he was so afraid and lonely in his white room at the hospital, I asked everyone he knew to visit. I went to the temple several times to ask Manshu. He did not come, though his wife did. It was around then that I began to hate him.</p><p>I was with my father when he died. He was in his bed, open-eyed and hallucinating. “It’s me. It’s me,” he said, right before he passed.</p><p>I took my father to Kanchi, a village by the Ganges, a hundred kilometres from Delhi, where many of the families in our lane perform cremations. As I walked around the pyre before it was lit and put the clarified butter on my father, I felt embarrassed, as if I were doing something wrong by pouring ghee on the nice silk kurta that he was wearing.</p><p>After the cremation, I asked Manshu to come to the house and lead the singing of the prayers. I did this because I wanted my father, even in death, to be surrounded by people he knew. People came and sat cross-legged in the courtyard. Manshu sat on cushions in a corner, singing and playing a harmonium. His cell phone was lying on the cushion beside him. Periodically it would ring and he would gesture for us to keep singing while he answered the phone with one hand and played the harmonium with the other.</p><p>I was standing in a corner during the ceremony. It was a beautiful day, and it seemed awful that my father was not there to see it. I also felt as though I were failing my father. He deserved more than this, and I had not provided it.</p><p>I left the courtyard and went out into the lane. I walked toward the end of the<span data-page="page_5"></span> alley. I was the only person there. As I walked, I panted. Halfway down the lane, there was a scooter, and a cow eating some trash. I could hear the sound of the prayers at our house dying down, and this made me feel worse. Once the prayers were over, all the rituals would be done and my father would somehow be more dead.</p><p>I came back to the courtyard and stood at the entrance. My mother was sitting near Manshu, her head covered with a fold of her white sari, rocking and weeping, surrounded by women, who were caressing her. Manshu looked up at me from his cushions and said, “Won’t somebody say something about the soul that has departed?”</p><p>I hate this eulogizing thing which has started up in India. To me, it is a Western fashion. The pandits now watch American movies and they want to be seen as doing the latest, most advanced thing.</p><p>I remained silent in my corner.</p><p>“Will you let him go without saying anything?” Manshu said to the crowd. “Is he so little loved?”</p><p>One of my uncles, who was sitting on the floor near me, tapped my ankle.</p><p>I began speaking. “<em>Ji</em>, you all know what a kind man my father was. You know how he helped found orphanages.” As I spoke, I started to sob. I was angry that this intimate thing had been turned into a display. “You know that, when my grandfather was dying, for two years he lay on his cot and my father took such good care of him that he never developed a bedsore.”</p><p>I hated Manshu for years after that. It seemed to me that he was pathologically selfish, that any decent person would have visited a dying relative, that any decent person would have tried to be humble during the funeral prayers instead of drawing attention to himself.</p><p>I stopped dropping by the temple. When we passed each other in the lane, I didn’t speak to him.</p><p>Manshu’s wife gave birth to two children, a girl named Priya and then, a few years later, a boy named Rahul. As a diabetic, she was taking a risk. The girl was born without complications, but when Aruna gave birth to the boy she went into a coma. My mother sat in the temple with the many people from the lane who had come to pray for her.</p><p>Aruna woke from her coma, but she remained unhealthy afterward. Years passed. Her black hair began to have white in it. She kept going in and out of the hospital. Manshu had bought a white van, but he sold it to pay the hospital bills. Aruna still sometimes sat outside their phone booth. Other times, they hired a neighborhood boy to oversee it. Eventually, she died.</p><p>Manshu was not close to his father’s side of the family, so he asked me to help with the funeral. I had to do everything, from hiring the jeweller to come and snip the nose ring out of Aruna’s nostril to buying the coconuts and grass used in the prayers. Manshu did not have enough money for a wooden pyre. I arranged for an electric cremation. I arranged for the jeep that took the body to the crematorium, and I hired a minibus to take people there. All the while, as I was doing this, I felt stupid for helping someone I hated.</p><p>Many people are vile. When I went with Manshu to pick up the ashes, the man who made us sign a register and then gave them to us in a white cardboard box said that often people didn’t bother to pick up their relatives’ remains. “That is family love,” he said, his eyes bloodshot, speaking with the bitterness typical of government employees.</p><p>I wanted to take the ashes directly to Kanchi, but as we were getting into the car Manshu asked if we could first go back to the lane. He said that the children needed to salute their mother. It was a bright, hot day. I sighed loudly, obviously. I wanted to say no, to tell him that I did not have time to waste. Shame kept me from saying this, of course.</p><p>All the way back into the city, the traffic was stop and go. Manshu sat with the box in a red duffelbag in his lap. We parked opposite the mouth of the lane, with the busy street between us and the lane’s entrance. Priya appeared, holding her brother’s hand, and as she led him across the road Manshu started sobbing. He got out of the car and left the bag on the seat and told his children to wait while he went and bought some flowers.</p><p>He left the car door open. I thought about closing it so that the air-conditioning wouldn’t escape. But it felt wrong to separate the children from their mother’s ashes. Manshu returned. He unzipped the bag so that we could see the box. “Say what I say,” he told them, and led them in a prayer, gesturing for them to put handfuls of geraniums in the bag.</p><p>The drive to Kanchi took hours. At some point, Manshu fell asleep, his chin tipping into his chest. I looked at him as I drove and remembered my father’s funeral ceremony, Manshu sitting in the corner talking on<span data-page="page_6"></span> his cell phone. I felt that I was a fool. I did not have the courage to take revenge.</p><p>Kanchi’s primary industry is funerals. You get off the highway and almost immediately there is a parking lot, because most cars are not allowed to drive in. Along the lanes from the parking lot to the river, there are only flower shops and the restaurants where families eat a meal before going back home. The village’s temples stand in a line by the river, and between them and the gray-green water is a steeply sloping sandy bank covered with shacks. Outside these, young men, Brahmans, in tight pants and cheap white shirts, stand waiting.</p><p>Manshu sat on a cot beside one of the shacks, and a young man led him through the prayers. The cardboard box was open before him and there was a plastic bag inside, with ashes and flecks of bone, like shards of seashell.</p><p>It was all depraved. In the middle of the prayers, the Brahman turned to me, since I had selected him, and asked me to give him more money than we had agreed to. I told him that he had no shame. He said the next part of the prayer, so that Manshu could keep going, and then repeated that I needed to pay more. We agreed on a new amount, and then the prayers were finished.</p><p>Manshu and I walked down to the long wooden boats by the river. Several boatmen, short and wiry, approached us as we reached the water. Again, as Manshu held the bag against his chest, there were nasty negotiations, with the boatmen demanding outrageous amounts. “Tell them that we need to go to the middle of the river,” Manshu whispered. Often, the boatmen would stroke only a few yards from shore and demand that one pour one’s ashes there. “You tell them,” I wanted to say.</p><p>We got into one of the boats and the boatman poled us into the river. In the distance was a bridge, and on the other side were large buildings with chimneys. Manshu sat in the bow with the red duffelbag in his lap.</p><p>It was now midafternoon, and for a while there was only the creak of the pole in its lock and the splash of the water. It was hot, and I was sweating heavily. The boatman pulled his pole out of the water and let us drift.</p><p>After a few minutes, he began stroking again so that we would not be caught by the current.</p><p>“Manshu, brother,” I said. “You have to do it.”</p><p>“She’ll be all alone,” Manshu murmured. “We won’t be here and she’ll be all alone.”</p><p>I did not know what to say to this. I was sitting a few feet from him. I got up and crossed the boat. The boat tipped beneath me, and the boatman moved from one side to the other. I took the box from the bag. “Let me help,” I said. Manshu looked up at me, startled. I took out my car keys and used one to tear open the plastic bag. I held the bag out over the river with one hand and shook the ashes into the water. Feeling the bag lighten, I realized that I was doing something wrong. When I poured my father’s ashes into the river, I had been glad that I was doing him this service, that I was taking care of him in this way. It was not fair to Aruna that someone outside her family was pouring her ashes into the river. It was not fair to Manshu that I was taking away this chance to care for his wife.</p><p>Once the bag was empty, I dipped it into the river and drained it so that all the ashes were gone. I flung the bag into the water. I threw the box also, and the government form that said that the ashes were human remains.</p><p>Near Kanchi is a village famous for the deities that craftsmen there make out of clay and straw. The villagers advertise their wares by standing the statues along the edge of the road. We drove back toward Delhi, past half a mile of gods. In the car, holding the steering wheel, I could still feel the bag lightening in my hands. Not knowing what to say about the terrible thing I had done, I spoke to Manshu about the future. “You have to think of Priya and Rahul. They only have you now.”</p><p>I parked the car by the mouth of our lane and phoned my mother and waited. After a few minutes, women began to appear, carrying buckets. It is a ritual in our families, after we have put someone in the Ganges, to bathe before we reënter the lane. Manshu and I got out of the car and took off our shoes and shirts. It was strange to feel the road beneath our bare feet and the hot polluted wind against our bellies. Then we tied towels around our waists and took off our pants and underwear. Scooters and bicycles stopped behind us and then slowly went around.</p><p>Before bathing myself, I bathed Manshu. I poured water on his head and then on his neck and back. I kneaded his fat shoulders. I rubbed his back with soap, his skin warm and the sun on<span data-page="page_final"></span> my hands. I knelt down beside him and washed his legs and feet. ♦</p>	Akhil Sharma	June 3, 2013 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/06/03/we-didnt-like-him	Ashes	Boats	Books	Boys	Cancer	Children	Unnamed	First	Children
Who Will Greet You at Home	<p>The <span data-page="page_1"></span>yarn baby lasted a good month, emitting dry, cotton-soft gurgles and pooping little balls of lint, before Ogechi snagged its thigh on a nail and it unravelled as she continued walking, mistaking its little huffs for the beginnings of hunger, not the cries of an infant being undone. By the time she noticed, it was too late, the leg a tangle of fibre, and she pulled the string the rest of the way to end it, rather than have the infant grow up maimed. If she was to mother a child, to mute and subdue and fold away parts of herself, the child had to be perfect.</p><p>Yarn had been a foolish choice, she knew, the stuff for women of leisure, who could cradle wool in the comfort of their own cars and in secure houses devoid of loose nails. Not for an assistant hairdresser who took danfo to work if she had money, walked if she didn’t, and lived in an “apartment” that amounted to a room she could clear in three large steps. Women like her had to form their children out of sturdier, more practical material to withstand the dents and scrapes that came with a life like hers. Her mother had formed her from mud and twigs and wrapped her limbs tightly with leaves, like moin moin: pedestrian items that had produced a pedestrian girl. Ogechi was determined that her child would be a thing of whimsy, soft and pretty and tender and worthy of love. But first she had to go to work.</p><p>She brushed her short choppy hair and pulled on one of her two dresses. Her next child would have thirty dresses, she decided, and hair so long it would take hours to braid, and she would complain about it to anyone who would listen, all the while exuding smug pride.</p><p>Ogechi treated herself to a bus ride only to regret it. Two basket weavers sat in the back row with woven raffia babies in their laps. One had plain raffia streaked with blues and greens, while the other’s baby was entirely red, and every passenger admired them. They would grow up to be tough and bright and skillful.</p><p>The children were not yet alive, so the passengers sang the call-and-response that custom dictated:</p><p>Where are you going?</p><p><em>I am going home.</em></p><p>Who will greet you at home?</p><p><em>My mother will greet me.</em></p><p>What will your mother do?</p><p><em>My mother will bless me and my child.</em></p><p>It was a joyous occasion in a young woman’s life when her mother blessed life into her child. The two girls flushed and smiled with pleasure when another woman commended their handiwork (such tight, lovely stitches) and wished them well. Ogechi wished them death by drowning, though not out loud. The congratulating woman turned to her, eager to spread her admiration, but once she had looked Ogechi over, seen the threadbare dress, the empty lap, and the entirety of her unremarkable package, she just gave an embarrassed smile and studied her fingers. Ogechi stared at her for the rest of the ride, hoping to make her uncomfortable.</p><p>When Ogechi had taken her first baby, a pillowy thing made of cotton tufts, to her mother, the older woman had guffawed, blowing out so much air she should have fainted. She’d then taken the molded form from Ogechi, gripped it under its armpits, and pulled it in half.</p><p>“This thing will grow fat and useless,” she’d said. “You need something with strong limbs that can plow and haul and scrub. Soft children with hard lives go mad or die young. Bring me a child with edges and I will bless it and you can raise it however you like.”</p><p>When Ogechi had instead brought her mother a paper child woven from the prettiest wrapping paper she’d been able to scavenge, her mother, laughing the whole time, had plunged it into the mop bucket until it softened and fell apart. Ogechi had slapped her, and her mother had slapped her back, and slapped her again and again till their neighbors heard the commotion and pulled the two women apart. Ogechi ran away that night and vowed never to return to her mother’s house.</p><p>At her stop, Ogechi alighted and picked her way through the crowded street until she reached Mama Said Hair Emporium, where she worked. Mama also owned the store next door, an eatery to some, but to others, like Ogechi, a place where the owner would bless the babies of motherless girls. For a fee. And Ogechi still owed that fee for the yarn boy who was now unravelled.</p><p>When she stepped into the Emporium, the other assistant hairdressers noticed her empty arms and snickered. They’d warned her about the yarn, hadn’t they? Ogechi refused to let the sting of tears in her eyes manifest and grabbed the closest broom.</p><p>Soon, clients trickled in, and the other girls washed and prepped their hair for Mama while Ogechi swept up the hair shed from scalps and wigs and weaves. Mama arrived just as the first customer had begun to lose patience and soothed her with compliments. She noted Ogechi’s empty arms with a resigned shake of her head and went to work, curling, sewing,<span data-page="page_2"></span> perming until the women were satisfied or in too much of a hurry to care.</p><p>Shortly after three, the two younger assistants left together, avoiding eye contact with Ogechi but smirking as if they knew what came next. Mama dismissed the remaining customer and stroked a display wig, waiting.</p><p>“Mama, I—”</p><p>“Where is the money?”</p><p>It was a routine Mama refused to skip. She knew perfectly well that Ogechi didn’t have any money. Ogechi lived in one of Mama’s buildings, where she paid in rent almost all of the meagre salary she earned, and ate only once a day, at Mama’s canteen next door.</p><p>“I don’t have it.”</p><p>“Well, what will you give me instead?”</p><p>Ogechi knew better than to suggest something.</p><p>“Mama, what do you want?”</p><p>“I want just a bit more of your joy, Ogechi.”</p><p>The woman had already taken most of her empathy, so that she found herself spitting in the palms of beggars. She’d started on joy the last time, agreeing to bless the yarn boy only if Ogechi siphoned a bit, just a dab, to her. All that empathy and joy and who knows what else Mama took from her and the other desperate girls who visited her back room kept her blessing active long past when it should have faded. Ogechi tried to think of it as a fair trade, a little bit of her life for her child’s life. Anything but go back to her own mother and her practical demands.</p><p>“Yes, Mama, you can have it.”</p><p>Mama touched Ogechi’s shoulder, and she felt a little bit sad, but nothing she wouldn’t shake off in a few days. It was an even trade.</p><p>“Why don’t you finish up in here while I check on the food?”</p><p>Mama was not gone for three minutes when a young woman walked in. She was stunning, with long natural hair and delicate fingers and skin as smooth and clear as fine chocolate. And in her hands was something that Ogechi wouldn’t have believed existed if she hadn’t seen it with her own eyes. The baby was porcelain, with a smooth glazed face wearing a precious smirk. It wore a frilly white dress and frilly socks and soft-soled shoes that would never touch the ground. Only a very wealthy and lucky woman would be able to keep such a delicate thing unbroken for the full year it would take before the child became flesh.</p><p>“I am looking for this Mama woman. Is this her place?”</p><p>Ogechi collected herself enough to direct the girl next door, then fell into a fit of jealous tears. Such a baby would never be hers. Even the raffia children of that morning seemed like dirty sponges meant to soak up misfortune when compared with the china child to whom misfortune would never stick. If Ogechi’s mother had seen the child, she would have laughed at how ridiculous such a baby would be, what constant coddling she would need. It would never occur to her that mud daughters needed coddling, too.</p><p>Where would Ogechi get her hands on such beautiful material? The only things here were the glossy magazines that advertised the latest styles, empty product bottles, which Mama would fill with scented water and try to sell, and hair. Hair everywhere—short, long, fake, real, obsidian black, delusional blond, bright, bright red. Ogechi upended the bag she’d swept the hair into, and it landed in a pile studded with debris. She grabbed a handful and shook off the dirt. Would she dare?</p><p>After plugging one of the sinks, she poured in half a cup of Mama’s most expensive shampoo. When the basin was filled with water and frothy with foam, she plunged the hair into it and began to scrub. She filled the sink twice more until the water was clear. Then she soaked the bundle in the matching conditioner, rinsed and towelled it dry. Next, she gathered up the silky strands and began to wind them.</p><p>Round and round until the ball of hair became a body and nubs became arms, fingers. The strands tangled together to become nearly impenetrable. This baby would not snag and unravel. This baby would not dissolve in water or rain or in nail-polish remover, as the plastic baby had that time. This was not a sugar-and-spice child to be swarmed by ants and disintegrate into syrup in less than a day. This was no practice baby formed of mud that she would toss into a drain miles away from her home.</p><p>She wrapped it in a head scarf and went to find Mama. The beautiful woman and her beautiful baby had concluded their business. Mama sat in her room counting out a boggling sum of money. Only after she was done did she wave Ogechi forward.</p><p>“Another one?”</p><p>“Yes, Mama.”</p><p>Ogechi did not uncover the child, and Mama didn’t ask, long since bored by the girl’s antics. They sang the traditional song:</p><p>Where are you going?</p><p><em>I am going home.</em></p><p>Who will greet you at home?</p><p><em>My mother will greet me.</em></p><p>What will your mother do?</p><p><em>My mother will bless me and my child.</em></p><p>Mama continued with her own special verse:</p><p>What does Mama need to bless this child?</p><p><em>Mama needs<span data-page="page_3"></span> whatever I have.</em></p><p>What do you have?</p><p><em>I have no money.</em></p><p>What do you have?</p><p><em>I have no goods.</em></p><p>What do you have?</p><p><em>I have a full heart.</em></p><p>What does Mama need to bless this child?</p><p><em>Mama needs a full heart.</em></p><p>Then Mama blessed her and the baby and, in lieu of a celebratory feast, gave Ogechi one free meat pie. Then she took a little bit more of Ogechi’s joy.</p><p>There was a good reason for Ogechi not to lift the cloth and let Mama see the child. For one, it was made of items found in Mama’s store, and even though they were trash, Mama would add this to her ledger of debts. Second, everybody knew how risky it was to make a child out of hair, infused with the identity of the person who had shed it. But a child of many hairs? Forbidden.</p><p>But the baby was glossy, and the red streaks glinted just so in the light, and it was sturdy enough to last a full year, easy. And after that year she would take it to her mother and throw it (not “it” the baby but the idea of it) in her mother’s face.</p><p>She kept the baby covered even on the bus, where people gave her coy glances and someone tried to sing the song, but Ogechi stared ahead and did not respond to her call.</p><p>The sidewalk leading to the door of her little room was so dirty she tiptoed along it, thinking that, if her landlord weren’t Mama, she would complain.</p><p>In her room, she laid the baby on an old pillow in an orphaned drawer. In the morning, it would come to life, and in a year it would be a strong and pretty thing.</p><p>There was an old tale about hair children. Long ago, girls would collect their sheddings every day until they had a bundle large enough to spin a child. One day, a storm blew through the town, and every bundle was swept from its hiding place into the middle of the market, where the hairs became entangled and matted together. The young women tried desperately to separate their own hairs from the others. The elder mothers were amused at the girls’ histrionics, how they argued over the silkiest patches and the longest strands. They settled the commotion thus: every girl would draw out one strand from every bundle until they all had an equal share. Some grumbled, some rejoiced, but all complied, and each went home with an identical roll.</p><p>When the time came for the babies to be blessed, all the girls came forward, each bundle arriving at the required thickness at the same time. There was an enormous celebration of this once-in-an-age event, and tearful mothers blessed their tearful daughters’ children to life.</p><p>The next morning, all the new mothers were gone. Some with no sign, others reduced to piles of bones stripped clean, others’ bones not so clean. But that was just an old tale.</p><p>The baby was awake in the morning, crying dry sounds, like stalks of wheat rubbing together. Ogechi ran to it, and smiled when the fibrous, eyeless face turned to her.</p><p>“Hello, child. I am your mother.”</p><p>But still it cried, hungry. Ogechi tried to feed it the detergent she’d given to the yarn one, but it passed through the baby as if through a sieve. Even though she knew it wouldn’t work, she tried the sugar water she had given to the candy child, with the same result. She cradled the child, the scritch of its cries grating her ears, and as she drew a deep breath of exasperation her nose filled with the scent of Mama’s expensive shampoo and conditioner, answering her question.</p><p>“You are going to be an expensive baby, aren’t you?” Ogechi said, with no heat. A child that cost much brought much.</p><p>Ogechi swaddled it, ripping her second dress into strips that she wound around the baby’s torso and limbs until it was almost fully covered, save for where Ogechi imagined the nose and mouth to be. She tried to make do with her own shampoo for now, which was about as luxurious as the bottom of a slow drain, but the baby refused it. Only when Ogechi strapped the child to her back did she find out what it wanted. The baby wriggled upward, and Ogechi hauled it higher, then higher still, until it settled its head on the back of her neck. Then she felt it, the gentle suckling at her nape as the child drew the tangled buds of her hair into its mouth. Ahh, now this she could manage.</p><p>Ogechi decided to walk today, unsure of how to nurse the child on the bus and still keep it secret, but she dreaded the busy intersection she would cross as she neared Mama’s Emporium. The people milling about with curious eyes, the beggars scanning and calculating the worth of passersby. Someone would notice, ask.</p><p>But as she reached the crossing not one person looked at her. They were all gathered in a crowd, staring at something that was blocked from Ogechi’s sight<span data-page="page_4"></span> by the press of bodies. After watching a woman try and fail to haul herself onto the low-hanging roof of a nearby building for a better view, Ogechi pulled herself up in one, albeit labored, move. Mud girls were good for something. She ignored the woman stretching her arm out for assistance and stood up to see what had drawn the crowd.</p><p>A girl stood with her mother, and though Ogechi could not hear them from where she perched, the stance, the working of their mouths—all was familiar. They were revealing a child in public? In the middle of the day? Even a girl like her knew how terribly vulgar this was. It was no wonder the crowd had gathered. Only a child of some magnitude would be unwrapped in public this way. What was this one, gold? No, the woman and the girl were not dressed finely enough for that. Their clothes were no better than Ogechi’s.</p><p>The child startled Ogechi when it moved. What she’d thought an obscene ruffle on the front of the girl’s dress was in fact the baby, no more than interlocking twigs and sticks—was that grass?—bound with old cloth. Scraps. A rubbish baby. It cried, the friction of sound so frantic and dry Ogechi imagined a fire flickering from the child’s mouth. A hiccup interrupted the noise, and when it resumed it was a human cry. The girl’s mother laughed and danced, and the girl just cried, pressing the baby to her breast. They uncovered the child together, shucking a thick skin of cloth and sticks, and Ogechi leaned as far as she could without falling from the roof to see what special attribute might have required a public showing.</p><p>The crowd was as disappointed as she was. It was just an ordinary child with an ordinary face. They started to disperse, some throwing insults at the two mothers and the baby they held between them for wasting everybody’s time. Others congratulated them with enthusiasm—it was a baby, after all. Something didn’t add up, though, and Ogechi was reluctant to leave until she understood what nagged her about the scene.</p><p>It was the new mother’s face. The child was as plain as pap, but the mother’s face was full of wonder. One would think the baby had been spun from silk. One would think the baby was speckled with diamonds. One would think the baby was loved. Mother cradled mother, who cradled child, a tangle of ordinary limbs of ordinary women.</p><p>There has to be more than this for me, Ogechi thought.</p><p>At the shop, the two young assistants prepped their stations and rolled their eyes at the sight of Ogechi and the live child strapped to her back. Custom forced politeness from them, and with gritted teeth they sang:</p><p>Welcome to the new mother</p><p><em>I am welcomed</em></p><p>Welcome to the new child</p><p><em>The child is welcomed</em></p><p>May her days be longer than the breasts of an old mother and fuller than the stomach of a rich man.</p><p>The second the words were out, they went back to work, as though the song were a sneeze, to be excused and forgotten. Until, that is, they took in Ogechi’s self-satisfied air, so different from the anxiousness that had followed in her wake whenever she had blessed a child in the past. The two girls were forced into deference, stepping aside as Ogechi swept where they would have stood still a mere day ago. When Mama walked in, she paused, sensing the shift of power in the room, but it was nothing to her. She was still the head. What matter if one toenail argued with the other? She eyed the bundle on Ogechi’s back but didn’t look closer and wouldn’t, as long as the child didn’t interfere with the work and, by extension, her coin.</p><p>Ogechi was grateful for the child’s silence, even though the suction on her neck built up over the day to become an unrelenting ache. She tired easily, as if the child were drawing energy from her. Whenever she tried to ease a finger between her nape and the child’s mouth, the sucking would quicken, so she learned to leave it alone. At the end of the day, Mama stopped her with a hand on her shoulder.</p><p>“So you are happy with this one.”</p><p>“Yes, Mama.”</p><p>“Can I have a bit of that happiness?”</p><p>Ogechi knew better than to deny her outright.</p><p>“What can I have in exchange?”</p><p>Mama laughed and let her go.</p><p>When Ogechi dislodged the child at the end of the day, she found a raw, weeping patch on her nape, where the child had sucked her bald. On the ride home, she slipped to the back of the bus, careful to cradle the child’s face against her ear so that no one could see it. The baby immediately latched on to her sideburn, and Ogechi spent the journey like that, the baby sucking an ache into her head. At home, she sheared off a small patch of hair and fed the child, who took the cottony clumps like a sponge absorbing water. Then it slept, and Ogechi slept, too.</p><p>If Mama wondered at Ogechi’s sudden ambition, she said nothing. Ogechi volunteered to trim ends. She volunteered to unclog the<span data-page="page_5"></span> sink. She kept the store so clean a rumor started that the building was to be sold. She discovered that the child disliked fake hair and would spit it out. Dirty hair was best, flavored with the person from whose head it had fallen. Ogechi managed a steady stream of food for the baby, but it required more and more as each day passed. All the hair she gathered at work would be gone by the next morning, and Ogechi had no choice but to strap the child to her back and allow it to chaw on her dwindling nape.</p><p>Mama was not curious about the baby, but the two assistants were. When Ogechi denied their request for a viewing, their sudden deference returned to malice tenfold. They made extra messes, strewing hair after Ogechi had cleaned, knocking bottles of shampoo over until Mama twisted their ears for wasting merchandise. One of the girls, the short one with the nasty scar on her arm, grew bolder, attempting to snatch the cover off the baby’s head and laughing and running away when Ogechi reacted. Evading her became exhausting, and Ogechi took to hiding the child in the shop on the days she opened, squeezing it in among the wigs or behind a shelf of unopened shampoos, and the thwarted girl grew petulant, bored, then gave up.</p><p>One day, while the child was nestled between two wigs, and Ogechi, the other assistants, and Mama were having lunch at the eatery next door, a woman stopped by their table to speak to Mama.</p><p>“Greetings.”</p><p>“I am greeted,” Mama said. “What is it you want?”</p><p>Mama was usually more welcoming to her customers, but this woman owed Mama money, and she subtracted each owed coin from her pleasantries.</p><p>“Mama, I have come to pay my debt.”</p><p>“Is that so? This is the third time you have come to pay your debt, and yet we are still here.”</p><p>“I have the money, Mama.”</p><p>“Let me see.”</p><p>The woman pulled a pouch from the front of her dress and counted out the money owed. As soon as the notes crossed her palm, Mama was all smiles.</p><p>“Ahh, a woman of her word. My dear, sit. You are looking a little rough today. Why don’t we get you some hair?”</p><p>The woman was too stunned by Mama’s kindness to heed the insult. Mama shooed one of the other assistants toward the shop, naming a wig the girl should bring. A wig that was near where Ogechi had stashed the baby.</p><p>“I’ll get it, Mama,” Ogechi said, getting up, but a swift slap to her face sat her back down.</p><p>“Was anyone talking to you, Ogechi?” Mama asked.</p><p>She knew better than to reply.</p><p>The assistant Mama had addressed snickered on her way out, and the other one smiled into her plate. Ogechi twisted her fingers into the hem of her dress and tried to slow her breathing. Maybe if she was the first to speak to the girl when she returned she could beg her. Or bribe her. Anything to keep her baby secret.</p><p>But the girl didn’t return. After a while, the woman who had paid her debt became restless and stood to leave. Mama’s tone was muted fury.</p><p>“Sit. Wait.” To Ogechi, “Go and get the wig, and tell that girl that if I see her again I will have her heart.” Mama wasn’t accustomed to being disobeyed.</p><p>Ogechi hurried to the shop expecting to find the girl agape at the sight of her strange, fibrous child. But the girl wasn’t there. The wig she’d been asked to bring was on the floor, and there, on the ledge where it had been, was the baby. Ogechi pushed it behind another wig and ran the first wig back to Mama, who insisted that the woman take it. Then Mama charged her, holding out her hand for payment. The woman hesitated, but paid. Mama gave nothing for free.</p><p>The assistant did not return to the Emporium, and Ogechi worried that she’d gone to call some elder mothers for counsel. But no one stormed the shop, and when Ogechi stepped outside after closing there was no mob gathered to dispense judgment. The second assistant left as soon as Mama permitted her to, calling for the first one over and over. Ogechi retrieved the baby and went home.</p><p>In her room, Ogechi tried to feed the child, but the hair rolled off its face. She tried again, selecting the strands and clumps it usually favored, but it rejected them all.</p><p>“What do you want?” Ogechi asked. “Isn’t this hair good enough for you?” This was said with no malice, and she leaned in to kiss the baby’s belly. It was warm, and Ogechi drew back from the unexpected heat.</p><p>“What have you got there?” she asked, a rhetorical question to which she did not expect an answer. But then the baby laughed, and Ogechi recognized the sound. It was the snicker she heard whenever she tripped over discarded towels or dropped the broom with her clumsy hands. It was the snicker she’d heard when Mama cracked her across the face at the eatery.</p><p>Ogechi distanced herself even more, and the child struggled to watch her, eventually rolling onto its side. It stilled when she stilled, and so Ogechi stopped moving, even after a whir<span data-page="page_6"></span> of snores signalled the child’s sleep.</p><p>Should she call for help? Or tell Mama? Help from whom? Tell Mama what, exactly? Ogechi weighed her options till sleep weighed her lids. Soon, too soon, it was morning.</p><p>The baby was crying, hungry. Ogechi neared it with caution. When it saw her, the texture of its cry softened and—Ogechi couldn’t help it—she softened, too. It was hers, wasn’t it? For better or for ill, the child was hers. She tried feeding it the hairs again, but it refused them. It did, however, nip hard at Ogechi’s fingers, startling her. She hadn’t given it any teeth.</p><p>She wanted more than anything to leave the child in her room, but the strangeness of its cries might draw attention. She bundled it up, trembling at the warmth of its belly. It latched on to her nape with a powerful suction that blurred her vision. This is the sort of thing a mother should do for her child, Ogechi told herself, resisting the urge to yank the baby off her neck. A mother should give all of herself to her child, even if it requires the marrow in her bones. Especially a child like this, strong and sleek and shimmering.</p><p>After a few minutes, the sucking eased to something manageable, the child sated.</p><p>At the Emporium, Ogechi kept the child with her, worried that it would cry if she removed it. Besides, the brash assistant who had tried to uncover the child was no longer at the shop, and Ogechi knew that she would never return. The other assistant was red-eyed and sniffling, unable to stop even after Mama gave her dirty looks. By lockup, Ogechi’s head was throbbing, and she trembled with exhaustion. She wanted to get home and pry the baby off her. She was anticipating the relief of that when the remaining assistant said, “Why have you not asked after her?”</p><p>“Who?” Stupid answer, she thought as soon as she uttered it.</p><p>“What do you mean who? My cousin that disappeared. Why haven’t you wondered where she is? Even Mama has been asking people about her.”</p><p>“I didn’t know you were cousins.”</p><p>The girl recognized Ogechi’s evasion.</p><p>“You know what happened to her, don’t you? What did you do?”</p><p>The answer came out before Ogechi could stop it.</p><p>“The same thing I will do to you,” she said, and the assistant took a step back, then another, before turning to run.</p><p>At home, Ogechi put the child to bed and stared until it slept. She felt its belly, which was cooling now, and recoiled at the thought of what could be inside. Then it gasped a little hairy gasp from its little hairy mouth, and Ogechi felt again a mother’s love.</p><p>The next morning, it was Ogechi’s turn to open the store, and she went in early to bathe the baby with Mama’s fine shampoo, sudsing its textured face, avoiding the bite of that hungry, hungry mouth. She was in the middle of rinsing off the child when the other assistant entered. She retreated in fear at first, but then she took it all in—Ogechi at the sink, Mama’s prized shampoo on the ledge, suds covering mother-knows-what—and she turned sly, running outside and shouting for Mama. Knowing that it was no use calling after her, Ogechi quickly wrapped the baby back up in her old torn-up dress, knocking over the shampoo in her haste. That was when Mama walked in.</p><p>“I hear you are washing something in my sink.” Mama looked at the spilled bottle, then back at Ogechi. “You are doing your laundry in my place?”</p><p>“I’m sorry, Mama.”</p><p>“How sorry are you, Ogechi, my dear?” Mama said, calculating. “Are you sorry enough to give me some of that happiness? So that we can forget all this?”</p><p>There was no need for a song now, as there was no new child to be blessed. Mama simply stretched her hand forward and held on, but what she thought was Ogechi’s shoulder was the head of the swaddled child.</p><p>Mama fell to the ground in undignified shudders. Her eyes rolled, as if she were trying to see everything at once. Ogechi fled. She ran all the way home, and, even through her panic, she registered the heat of the child in her arms, like the just-stoked embers of a fire. In her room, she threw the child into its bed, expecting to see whorls of burned flesh on her arms but finding none. She studied the baby, but it didn’t look any different. It was still a dense tangle of dark fibre with the occasional streak of red. She didn’t touch it, even when the mother in her urged her to. At any moment, Mama would show up with her goons, and Ogechi was too frightened to think of much else. But Mama didn’t appear, and she fell asleep waiting for the pounding at her door.</p><p>Ogechi woke in the middle of the night with the hair child standing over her. It should not have been able to stand, let alone haul itself onto her bed. Nor should it have been able to fist her hair in a grip so tight her scalp puckered or stuff an appendage into her mouth to block her scream. She tried to tear it apart, but the seams held. Only when she rammed it into<span data-page="page_final"></span> the wall did it let go. It skittered across the room and hid somewhere that the candle she lit couldn’t reach. Ogechi backed toward the door, listening, but what noise does hair make?</p><p>When the hair child jumped onto Ogechi’s head, she shrieked and shook herself, but it gripped her hair again, tighter this time. She then did something that would follow her all her days. She raised the candle and set it on fire. And when the baby fell to the ground, writhing, she covered it with a pot and held it down, long after her fingers had blistered from the heat, until the child, as tough as she’d made it, stopped moving.</p><p>Outside, she sat on the little step in front of the entrance to her apartment. No one had paid any mind to the noise—this wasn’t the sort of building where one checked up on screams. Knees to her chin, Ogechi sobbed into the calloused skin, feeling part relief, part something else—a sliver of empathy Mama hadn’t been able to steal. There was so much dirt on the ground, so much of it everywhere, all around her. When she turned back into the room and lifted the pot, she saw all those pretty, shiny strands transformed into ash. Then she scooped dirt into the pot and added water.</p><p>This she knew. How to make firm clay—something she was born to do. When the mix was just right, she added a handful of the ashes. Let this child be born in sorrow, she told herself. Let this child live in sorrow. Let this child not grow into a foolish, hopeful girl with joy to barter. Ogechi formed the head, the arms, the legs. She gave it her mother’s face. In the morning, she would fetch leaves to protect it from the rain. ♦</p>	Lesley Nneka Arimah	October 26, 2015 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/who-will-greet-you-at-home	Babies	Books	Children	Dolls	Fairy Tales	Hair	Ogechi	Third	Children
