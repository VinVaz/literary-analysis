A Death in Kitchawank	<p>Saturday, <span data-page="page_1"></span>just after two, the sun a hot compress on her shoulders and scalp, the shrieks and catcalls of the children as they splash in the shallows a kind of symphony of the usual. Behind her, the sharp <em>thwock</em> of the dense black rubber ball as it rockets from the paddle and slaps the wall, regular as a heartbeat till one of the men miscalculates and it freezes in cardiac arrest on the tail of a stifled curse. One beat, two, and here it comes again: <em>thwock</em>. She’s thinking that she should have brought her straw hat with her to the beach—she wouldn’t want a thin red line of sunburn etched into the parting of her hair—but she’ll worry about that later, or maybe not at all. She hasn’t worn her hat in a week or more now—she hates hats, hats are a thing of her mother’s day—and her tan is deep, even at her hairline. She’s wearing a pair of oversized sunglasses, new from the drugstore yesterday, and last year’s black one-piece, which is maybe a little tight around the hips and waist, but so what? She’s not on display here. This is her beach, her community, her lake. These are her friends and neighbors gathered in their beach chairs and sprawled across their fluffed-up towels and beach blankets, with their paperbacks and newspapers and Hebrew National wieners. This is the peace at the center of life. This, this Saturday in July, as her mind runs free and her only worry is to shift the straps on her shoulders and gloss her lips to keep them from drying out.</p><p>In the house, which she could see if she craned her neck to look back past the concession stand and the paddleball courts and the big open grassy field, where teen-age couples are strolling hand in hand, is the refrigerator, new three years ago and as cluttered as if it had been there a century. In its cool dark depths are the steaks in a covered dish of honey-ginger marinade, the potato salad and coleslaw she put up after breakfast, and the Rose’s lime juice and vodka for the gimlets. All is well. And so what if the warm shifting sand beneath her feet has to be trucked in every other year at the expense of the Kitchawank Colony Association, its hundreds of billions of individual grains disappearing into the high grass, washing into the lake, adhering to toes and arches and tanned sinewy ankles only to wind up on bathroom tiles and beneath the kitchen sink? It’s as essential as air, as the water itself: how could you have a beach without it?</p><p>When she next opens her eyes it’s to the quick cold shock of Susan, her youngest, snuggling in beside her, everything wet suddenly, as if a whole basket of fish had been upended in her lap. She feels the bunched knees poking at her, the shuddering rib cage and chattering teeth, hears her own voice jump up: “Get off, honey, you’re all wet!” And Susan, freckled, stick-limbed, ten years old, snuggling tighter. “I’m cold, Mommy.” She reaches behind her for the beach bag and the towel, and then she’s wrapping her daughter and holding her close till the shivering stops and Susan springs loose to chase half a dozen other kids to the concession stand. She lifts her sunglasses for a moment to watch her go, and here are the Sollovays, the Greens, the Goldsteins, settling in around her in a wash of greeting and banter and sheer high spirits. Marsha Goldstein, her legs silken and her lips fluttering around her smile, offers a cigarette, but she prefers her own and they both light up and let the tobacco lift them, until in unison, as if they’d rehearsed it, they throw back their heads and exhale in long twin plumes of blue. “What time did you want us tonight?” Marsha asks. “Five-ish?”</p><p>“Yes,” she says, “yes, that’ll be perfect,” and she glances over her shoulder, past the courts and the chain-link fence and the screen of trees to where her house sits tranquilly on its own little rise—the only house, of the two hundred or more in the Colony, that looks directly onto the lake, a fact of which she tries not to be too sinfully proud. And it’s funny, because with the way the light comes off the lake and the big picture window stands in shadow she can see into her own kitchen and the table there, already set for dinner, the clock on the yellow wall, time ticking by, and it’s almost as if she were in two places at once.</p><p>[Forgive me for stepping in here but I do want to get this right—the fact is I may have been there that day. The threads of the past are so snarled that, thirty-five years on, I’ve lost the ability to separate them with any clarity. But if I was there I would have been on the paddleball court, playing in a fiercely competitive and very physical foursome with Miriam’s husband, Sid, and her two sons—Alan, who was twenty-six, and Lester, my best friend, who was then twenty-two, like me. And I would have entered the next scene, too, the dinner scene, preceded by cocktails and the long unwinding of a muggy Saturday afternoon, the corded muscles of my legs gone<span data-page="page_2"></span> limp in the afterglow of exercise and the slow seep of alcohol.]</p><p>She’s got both fans going, the one at the kitchen window and the big lazy ceiling fan revolving in a slow slippage of optical illusion over the table, but she’s still dripping. Marsha’s with her, their drinks perspiring on the counter while they stand elbow to elbow at the cutting board, slicing long squared-off strips of carrot and wafer-thin slivers of Vidalia onion for the salad, dicing cucumbers and halving cherry tomatoes still warm from the garden, Marsha, who was the maid of honor at her wedding just as she was the maid of honor when Marsha married David in a time when there were only the four of them. Now the boys are in their twenties, Susan’s ten, and Marsha’s daughter, Seldy, is sixteen, or, no, seventeen.</p><p>From the living room comes the sound of the men, their voices rich and pleased as they call down the questions of the day, revile Nixon, trade quips with the boys. Les has begun to wear his hair long and dress in bell-bottoms and spangled shirts, in confraternity with his friend T., who looks so satisfied he could be flying across the room on his own magic-carpet ride. She’s had her moments of worry—or not worry, really, just concern—over whether the boys have been experimenting with tea or grass or whatever they call it these days, but she’s never said anything. And won’t. She doesn’t want to harp.</p><p>They’re just sitting down to dinner—to the artichokes, one per plate, the grill out on the deck sending up smoke under the steaks—when Seldy, in a yellow sundress that shows off the figure she’s been growing into over the past year, drifts into the room, late as usual. Her mother says, “It’s about time,” and her father makes a quip about how she must’ve got lost on the gruelling four-minute drive from their house, but Sid and the three boys are dumbstruck for one thunderous instant. This is the face of beauty, and though they’re all family here, though Seldy’s like a daughter to Sid and a sister to the boys—Miriam’s boys, anyway—none of that matters. Sid’s the first to break the spell, his voice rising to emphasize the joke: “Well, Jesus Christ, we thought we were going to wilt away and starve waiting for you.” And then the boys are falling all over themselves to wave and grin and ante up the wit, and Seldy, flushing, slides into the empty seat between Alan and Les, letting the steam from the artichoke rise gently about her face and the long trailing ends of her hair slip from her shoulders to sway gracefully over her plate.</p><p>It is then, just as Sid rises to check on the steaks (nobody here wants anything but rare and rarer, and he’d be offended if they did), that the first eruption of thunder rolls across the lake to shake the house and rattle the ice cubes in the drinks that Miriam has just freshened. The sky goes instantly dark, as if a shade had been drawn over the day. She’s wondering if she should go and rummage through the kitchen drawer for the candles left over from Hanukkah when the storm chases a cool breeze through the screens, and Marsha waves her napkin in front of her face, letting out a sigh of relief. “Thank God,” she says. “Oh, yes, bring it on.”</p><p>The first raindrops, big and slow and widely dispersed, begin to thump at the shingles, and there’s Sid, with his muscled arms and bald head, out on the deck, hustling the lid off the grill and flipping the steaks, the worn boards spotted all around him. “Better hurry, Sid!” David calls, and then it’s really coming down, the original deluge, and this is funny, deeply, infectiously funny—Sid flipping steaks and wet through in an instant—because there’s no harm done, no harm at all. They’ll have candles, they’ll eat, and the evening, with its rising fertile smell of grass and the earth at the edge of the woods, will settle in around them, as cool and sweet as if the whole neighborhood were air-conditioned.</p><p>[I see I’ve written myself into the scene after all, a refugee from my own fractured family, at peace in the moment. Fair enough. But peace neither lasts nor suffices, and the fact was that Lester and I pursued the available pharmacopoeia far more assiduously than Miriam could ever have imagined. We were stoned at that very moment, I’m sure of it, and not on anything as innocuous as marijuana—stoned, and feeling blessed. Feeling, in the midst of all that radiant love and tranquillity, that we were getting away with something.]</p><p>Time jumps and jumps again, the maples struck with color, the lake giving up a thin sheet of wrinkled ice along the shore, and then there’s the paucity of winter with its skeletal trees and the dead fringe of reeds stuck like an old man’s beard in the gray jaws of the ice. The months spin out until the pointer stops on a day in March, gray as death, Susan working against the chill in the unheated basement with the girls from the Explorers’ Club at school, building a canoe from a kit shipped in all the way from Minnesota, while Miriam tiptoes around upstairs, arranging warm-from-the-oven<span data-page="page_3"></span> oatmeal cookies on a platter and pouring hot cocoa from the thermos into six porcelain teacups, each with its own marshmallow afloat in the center like a white spongy island.</p><p>When she opens the basement door, there’s an overpowering smell of epoxy and the distilled vinegar that Sid got for cleanup, and she worries about that, about the fumes, but the girls seem oblivious. They cluster around her in a greedy, jostling pack, hands snatching at the cookies and the too-hot cups. Susan already has three cookies clenched in her hand, privilege of the house, as she stabs her tongue at the marshmallow in her cup, a mustache of chocolate sketching itself in above her upper lip.</p><p>“Shouldn’t you girls have some ventilation in here?” Miriam says, just to hear herself, but they’re fine, they assure her, and it’s going great, it really is.</p><p>The canoe, lying overturned on a pair of sawhorses, has been a long winter’s project, Sid doing the lion’s share of the work on weekends, though the girls have been fairly diligent about the handsanding, the cutting and fitting of the fibreglass cloth, and the slow smoothing of the epoxy over it. It’s just that they’re at an age when gathering for any purpose outside of school is a lark, and they can’t help frittering away their time gossiping, spinning records, dancing to the latest beat or craze or whatever it is, their thin arms flailing, hair in motion, legs going like pogo sticks. They make fast work of the cookies and chocolate. And now, sated, they watch her warily, wondering why she’s lingering when it’s clear that her motherly duties have been dispensed with, and so she gathers up the cups, sets them on the tray, and starts back up the stairs.</p><p>Thanks to Sid, who is a father like no other, despite the fact that he has to drag himself home every night after a stifling commute and the kind of hard physical labor on one job site after another that would prostrate a man half his age, the canoe is ready for its maiden voyage by the time the ice shrinks back from the shore and the sun makes its first evanescent return. Miriam sits stiffly on the bench by the playground, Marsha beside her, while the girls divide themselves democratically into two groups of three, roll up their jeans in the icy shallows, and see the first group off in a mad frantic windmilling of forearms and paddles. “Be careful, now!” she calls, and she’s pleased to see that her daughter has been gracious or, at least, patient enough to wait her turn in the second group. As Susan leans forward to push the canoe off, her ankles chapped with the cold, her face long and grave and bursting with expectation, it’s too much for Miriam, and she has to look away to where the paddles flash in the pale depleted sunlight and the canoe cuts back and forth across the black surface like the blades of her pinking shears.</p><p>Marsha, who has come to lend moral support, lights a second cigarette off the end of her first and flicks the still smoldering butt into the dun grass at their feet, exhaling with a long complicated sigh. “Too cute by half,” she says.</p><p>Miriam’s on her feet—she wants to let go but just can’t help herself—listening to her own voice skitter over the water and ricochet back again: “Don’t get too far out! Girls! Girls?”</p><p>“I heard from Seldy last night,” Marsha’s saying as Miriam eases back down on the bench. Seldy’s at Stony Brook. A junior. On scholarship and majoring in math, she’s that smart.</p><p>“And how is she?”</p><p>A pause. The canoe, far out now—halfway to the other shore and its dense dead accumulation of shoulder-high weeds—makes a wobbly, long-stemmed turn and starts back, the girls paddling in unison, finally getting it. “Terrible. Worse than”—Marsha’s voice, wadded with grief and anger, chokes in her throat—“I don’t know, <em>anything</em>.”</p><p>“What? What is it? She isn’t—”</p><p>“She’s dropping out.”</p><p>Miriam is so surprised she can’t help repeating the phrase, twisting it with the inflection of disbelief. “She’s dropping out?” Caught up in the moment, she doesn’t stop to consider that both of her own sons dropped out in their time, too.</p><p>“It’s that boy.”</p><p>“What boy?”</p><p>“You know, the one from high school that went to the community college for all of half a semester—Richie?”</p><p>For a moment, Miriam’s confused, the name caught on her lips like an invocation—<em>Richie</em>, <em>Richie</em>?—and then suddenly she can picture him, tall and rangy in a swimsuit so tight you could see every crease and fold, the washboard stomach, hair that fell across his face like a raven’s wing, Richie Spano, the wise guy, the joker, with his braying laugh and the look on his face when you caught him out that said, I am so far above this.</p><p>“You’re kidding.”</p><p>“I wish.”</p><p>And here’s the canoe, scraping at the sand that will have to be replaced again this spring or they’ll all be hip-deep in mud, and Susan now trading places with the girl in back, the power position, raising her paddle high as if it were the honed glistening spear of a warrior out for conquest.</p><p>A puff of smoke. A long mournful inhalation and Marsha won’t look her in the<span data-page="page_4"></span> eye. “They’re going to get a place in the Village, she says. Live free. Do their thing.”</p><p>The canoe, Miriam sees, is stuck there under the weight of the girls, and she has to restrain herself from interfering until finally Susan digs her paddle into the bottom to push them off and the canoe rides free in a shimmer of light.</p><p>“Or some such crap,” Marsha says.</p><p>[I was already gone by then, trying to redeem myself in grad school, and Les was in San Francisco, managing the first Cajun-style restaurant to appear there, but I knew Richie Spano from the time Les and I had rented a house in the Colony three years earlier. There was a lot of traffic in that house—friends, musicians, druggies, friends of friends, friends of druggies—and Richie drifted in from time to time. He was quick on his feet, cocky, borderline obnoxious, with a mean streak that was something sick. One night, apropos of nothing, he plucked the darts out of the board on the kitchen wall and nailed my girlfriend’s cat with one of them—which stuck there in the stripe of fur along its spine, quivering like a banderilla, until the cat vanished and bled all over the carpet in the back room and cost thirty-five dollars to repair at the vet’s, money I paid out of my own pocket because Richie Spano wasn’t about to pay anybody anything.]</p><p>Miriam is there at the window one soft mist-hung morning in the spring of a year when the canoe has been all but forgotten, chained to a rail on a grassy strand off to the far side of the beach in a mismatched tumble of upended boats, the girls on to other pursuits now, most of them boyrelated. Susan is seventeen, too nervous by half over her college applications, her A.P. courses, the way Mr. Honer presses her to practice though she’s only third violin and Mr. Davies rides roughshod over the Thespian Club, but her room is decorated with posters of shirtless, long-haired boys posing with guitars in their hands.</p><p>Miriam’s sipping a cup of tea while her cigarette levitates smoke at her elbow, caught in a recollection of her own seventeen-year-old self, when she first came up from Stelton for the summer to stay with her cousins in a bungalow not three city blocks from where she’s sitting now. No one would have described her as shy back then, and when she went to the beach with her cousin Molly the first afternoon and saw a group of boys sweating over a little black ball on the paddleball court she went right up to them, not five feet away, and watched as they leaped and grimaced and slammed at the ball with all the raw frustrated adolescent power boiling up out of them, until they began to falter, to hit out, to lose the rhythm of the game—and it was no secret why. It was because she was there, with her pretty, dark features, which everyone said were just like Rita Hayworth’s, with her nails freshly done and a white towel slung insouciantly over one shoulder, dressed in the swimsuit she’d spent the better part of an hour admiring in the full-length mirror at Genung’s before she said yes and counted out the money at the cash register. There were four boys playing and half a dozen others sprawled on the grass at the edge of the court, but the one who caught her eye—the tall one, with slicked-back dirty-blond hair, shrinking T-shirt, and black high-top basketball shoes that he wore without socks—was Sid.</p><p>She shifts in her seat, lifts the cigarette to her lips to consolidate the recollection, but the cigarette is dead. And the tea—the tea’s gone cold. She’s about to push herself up and light the gas under the kettle when a movement on the ball field catches her eye. There’s someone out there—two people, a boy and a girl—and that strikes her as odd, because it’s a school day and though it’s officially spring the leaves of the trees are still wound tight in the grip of their buds and it’s cold, especially with the way the mist is pushing in off the lake. Hardly beach weather.</p><p>She’s already put up dinner—a pot roast simmering in the Crock-Pot that Les gave her for her birthday last year—and she’s been through the newspaper twice. Is she bored? Lonely? In need of stimulation? She supposes so. She’s been spending an awful lot of time sitting at the window lately, talking on the telephone or just dreaming, and she’s been putting on weight, too. But what <em>are</em> they doing out there?</p><p>In the next moment she’s in the front hall, shrugging into her faded blue parka, and then she’s out in the air, heading down the path to where her property ends and the single-lane gravel road loops through the high chain-link gate and peters out in the beach area. She veers left, onto the grass of the outfield, and feels it wet on the worn suède moccasins she slipped on at the door. When she gets closer—when she’s halfway to the two figures bent over what looks to be a big gray-green stone protruding from the grass—she recognizes Seldy. Seldy, in bell-bottom jeans and a serape and some sort of leather cowboy hat pulled down so far it<span data-page="page_5"></span> masks her eyes. And who’s that with her? Richie. Richie, looking as if he were dressed for Halloween, with his long hair, his tie-dyed shirt, and a ragged cloth overcoat he might have dug out of the pile at the Salvation Army.</p><p>She’s not thinking, really—and the way she’s dressed and with her hair uncombed and no makeup on she’s not especially in the mood to see anybody at the moment—but she’s here now and that thing on the ground, she sees, is no rock. It’s moving. And the boy—<em>Richie</em>—is stabbing at it with a fallen branch. In the very instant she opens her mouth to say “Hi,” startling them both, she realizes what it is: a turtle. One of the big ridge-backed turtles that come up out of the lake to lay their eggs on the apron of sand at the edge of the ball field.</p><p>Seldy tries for a smile and only partly succeeds. Richie ignores her.</p><p>“Are you up visiting?” she hears herself say, even as Richie forces the stick into the animal’s mouth and the jaws clamp down with an audible crack.</p><p>“See that?” he says. “One of these things can take your hand off if you’re not careful.”</p><p>Very softly, as if afraid to raise her voice, Seldy says, “Yes,” but that’s puzzling, because Marsha didn’t breathe a word about a visit, and it takes a moment for Miriam to realize that they must be staying with Richie’s parents on the other side of the lake—or not even on the lake, really, but in a development off Amazon Road. And then a scenario from a year ago presents itself, a dinner party she was giving for a new couple, the Abramsons—he’s a doctor in the city—and how Seldy, up for the weekend, had sat rigidly between her parents and barely said a word all night. Except to be negative. At one point, early on, before the Abramsons and the others arrived, Miriam had been rearranging the flowers in the big cut-glass vase she’d inherited from her mother, soliciting Marsha’s opinion, just chattering, that was all, when Seldy, her face sour and her lips drawn down, snapped at her out of nowhere. “Jesus, Miriam, it’s only the Colony, only the sticks,” she said, and her voice was like a saw cutting the house in two. “You’d think you were Mrs. Dalloway or something.”</p><p>It’s cold—raw—and she tightens the parka around her. She’s about to say something inane like “That’s nice,” when Richie jerks the branch from the turtle’s mouth and brings it down hard on the slick gleaming carapace, not once but twice. He’s lifting it again, lifting it high, when she steps forward and takes hold of the end of it so quickly she surprises herself. “What are you doing?” she demands, her voice gone harsh in her throat.</p><p>To his credit, he doesn’t resist, and the stick is hers now, to drop in the grass at her feet while the turtle, hissing, thrashes its head back and forth as if it can’t pinpoint the source of the threat. “Thing doesn’t deserve to live,” he says, and his eyes are unfocussed, fully dilated, as if he were dreaming on his feet. “They’re just trash anyway. They kill fish, ducks even. They—”</p><p>“No,” she says, cutting him off, “no. They belong here. They have a right to live just like everything else.” She wants to go on, wound up all of a sudden, but he’s already turned his back on her, stalking across the grass in his high-heeled boots—purple, purple boots—and she’s left there with Seldy. Who has nothing to say. Her best friend’s daughter, a girl she’s known since she was in the cradle, and she has nothing to say. Miriam wants to invite her up to the house for tea, a bagel, a good long chat about dropping out, about fashion, and respect for nature, and life in the Village—<em>freaks</em>, <em>they call themselves freaks</em>—but she finds, in that moment, that she has nothing to say, either.</p><p>[I remember stopping by one year during spring break and finding Miriam in a lawn chair out on the fringe of the ball field, wrapped in an old sleeping bag, keeping watch over a pair of nesting turtles while a pickup game went on behind her. I must have spent an hour crouched there beside her, catching up on things, as the turtles patiently extruded their eggs, as if time had gone back a millennium and there were no lawnmowers or automobiles or boys with sticks and rocks and baseball bats poised to annihilate them. And where was Sid? Working. Always working. He’d had his reverses on the stock market and elsewhere, a tough year, but he was still a member of the tin-knockers’ union and always had work. As far as I could tell, he didn’t even know turtles existed.]</p><p>And it’s another day, a year further on, Susan at Rutgers and loving it, or so she says on the odd nights when she bothers to call, and Miriam has just got off the phone with her cousin Molly, who lives in Connecticut now and whose youngest—Mark, just twenty-four—has had some sort of nervous breakdown. Or worse. He’s been in treatment since he was a teen-ager, and nobody wants to call it schizophrenia, because you don’t come back from that. They say that it runs<span data-page="page_6"></span> in families, and, when Miriam comes to think of it, Molly’s father was no mental paragon, scared of his own face in the mirror, hearing voices, talking nonsense half the time. She just thanks her lucky stars her own children turned out normal, though sometimes she wonders about Les, out there on the West Coast, unmarried at thirty and running with a fast crowd, restaurant people, bar people, people who use drugs and don’t go to bed till the sun rises.</p><p>She pushes herself up from the table, aching in her joints—and there’s a sharp pain in the calf of her left leg, a kind of thrilling or buzzing that goes away almost as soon as she puts a name to it. From the window she can see the wall of the paddleball courts, which are empty at this hour on a weekday, and beyond them Rose Shapiro—eighty and stooped—pacing the beach as if she were making her way across the steppes of Russia like poor Dr. Zhivago, and the sight only depresses her the more. You marry, have children, cook, clean, get sick, get old, pace the beach till you can’t even remember who you are. That’s life. That’s what it is.</p><p>It is then that she thinks of the canoe. Susan had it out last summer once or twice, but aside from that it has just sat there inert for years. She’s suddenly seized with the idea of it, its smooth white skin pressed to the belly of the water, clouds scudding by overhead, the release of it, gliding, just gliding. She makes herself a sandwich at the kitchen counter, pours juice into the thermos, selects a paperback from the shelf in the den, and goes out into the day and the sunlight, which flares with sudden brilliance, feeling as if she were off on an adventure.</p><p>She has some trouble with the combination lock—it’s rusty, that’s all—and then, once she’s got the chain free and tries to flip the boat over, she finds it’s unaccountably heavy. There’s no one to see her, really, aside from Mrs. Shapiro, who barely glances up from her own shoelaces, but still she feels embarrassed to think that she can’t even flip over a canoe, a thing she must have done a hundred times when she was a girl. Is she really that old and weak? She sucks in her breath and gives it another try, like one of those puffed-up Russian weight lifters in the Olympics on TV, and there it is, like a miracle, right side up and thumping reverberantly to the ground. The sound echoes out over the water and comes back again, thrilling with the chatter of birds and the soughing of the breeze in the branches overhead. It’s April. She’s fifty-eight years old. And her feet, her bare feet, are in the water now, the canoe hovering before her and threatening to tip first one way and then the other until all at once she’s firmly planted in the seat and the paddle is working in her sure tight grip and the shore retreats behind her.</p><p>It’s a joy. A lark. And almost immediately she finds her rhythm, the motion—dip and rise and dip again—coming back to her as if it were ingrained in her muscle memory, and maybe it is, though it’s been more years than she can count. She feels the sun on her face and when she shifts position it wraps itself across her shoulders like an electric blanket, warming and gentle. By the time she thinks to look back to where her house sits reduced on the horizon, she’s nearly to the far side of the lake. What she’s thinking is that she should do this more often—get out, enjoy life, breathe the air—and she makes a promise to herself that, starting tomorrow, she will. It’s not even noon yet when she lays the paddle athwart the gunwales and unwraps her sandwich, pastrami on rye, just letting the boat drift, and isn’t this the best pastrami on rye she’s ever had? The canoe rocks. She lies back, for just a moment, and closes her eyes.</p><p>When she wakes, she can’t imagine where she is, despite the evidence all around her. It takes her a minute to come fully to herself. The sun is gone, the clouds bleeding across the sky. And the wind is stronger now, damper, sweeping out of the south with a scent of rain. She’s not wearing her watch—she left it at home for fear of getting it wet—and that further disorients her, as if knowing the time would put everything back in its place. Nothing for it but to paddle, but which way? She can’t see the shore from here, not through the low-bellied clouds. As well as she can figure, the canoe must have been carried all the way down the lake while she dozed. All right. She’ll just orient herself, that’s all. She swivels around, scanning both shores till she finds a fixed point, the pale white tower of the seminary all the way up on Stony Street emerging suddenly from the clouds and the canopy of the distant trees, which means she has to go in . . . that direction, there, behind her now. She feels the relief wash over her—at least she knows where she is—until she reaches for the<span data-page="page_7"></span> paddle, or the place where the paddle was, and finds it gone.</p><p>[This became a family legend, trotted out at dinner parties over the years, the story of how Miriam used her hands to paddle the boat to the nearest point, which unfortunately lay on the far side of the lake, and how she walked a good mile and a half barefoot before she got to Kitchawank Village and the pay phone in front of the liquor store there and realized she didn’t have a cent to her name, let alone a dime. How she turned around and walked another three blocks on the cold hard unforgiving pavement till she got to Lowenstein’s Deli, and Sy Lowenstein let her use the store phone to call Sid, who was installing heating ducts in a fourplex in Mount Kisco, where, thank God, they had a phone already hooked up on the ground floor, to please come get her before she froze to death. And how Sid let out one of his arpeggiated “Jesus Christ!”s and went twenty miles over the limit all the way back and then had to take her out to Fiorvanti’s because there was no dinner on the table that night.]</p><p>It’s an autumn day in an advancing year, the trees brilliant around the lake, each leaf painted a distinctive shade and the whole blended as in a Monet, when the phone rings and she picks up to hear from Molly, all the way out in Connecticut, that Seldy is getting married. To Richie Spano. Who, at thirty-four, is assistant manager of some sort of appliance store in Yorktown Heights and apparently making a decent living, though no one would have thought it from the way he was raised.</p><p>What goes through her mind first is a quick envious accounting—neither Alan nor Les is married yet, nor do they look to be soon, and Susan’s been so busy studying for the bar that she hasn’t had a date in months, or not that Miriam knows of, anyway—and then, as she forms the words “She hasn’t told me anything about it,” the hurt sets in. This is Marsha, her best friend all these years, maid of honor at her own wedding, and she can’t call her with the news? Yes, well, maybe they have been like strangers lately, because things are different now, everybody getting older and more stay-at-home, the Colony breaking down as people die off or move away to Florida, but that doesn’t mean you can’t pick up a telephone.</p><p>As soon as she hangs up—before it occurs to her that maybe Marsha’s ashamed to have such a son-in-law, not to mention a daughter throwing her life away—she’s dialling. What she wants to say is “Hello, how are you?” so that she can ease into the situation as gracefully as possible, but her lips betray her. “Marsha?” she says. “How come you didn’t tell me the good news?”</p><p>“Hello, Miriam, is that really you?” Marsha returns, her rasping voice as familiar as Miriam’s own. “It’s been too long, hasn’t it, what with one thing and another. But news? What news are you talking about?”</p><p>“Seldy. Getting married. Are you planning a spring wedding, then—June? Like you and David? And Sid and me?”</p><p>There’s a pause. The sound of a match striking and Marsha drawing smoke into her lungs. “No,” she breathes finally, “no, that’s not the way it is anymore.”</p><p>And then there’s the exegesis, a story stewed in its details and leaning heavily toward Richie and Richie’s feelings. Richie—he grew up Catholic, did she know that?—hates religion, just <em>hates</em> it, and so does Seldy, or that’s what she claims. They don’t want a fuss. Don’t want anybody there—and it was like pulling teeth just to get them to say that she and David could stand as witnesses when they go before the justice of the peace.</p><p>There’s a pause. Silence on both ends of the line. “Well, could we at least host the reception?” Miriam puts in, feeling nothing but shame and disappointment for Marsha—and for herself, herself, too.</p><p>Very softly: “No, I don’t think so. I think the Spanos—Rich, Sr., and Carlotta, the parents?—I think they have something planned.”</p><p>She wants to shout back at her “You think?” but she goes numb all over, the phone pressed to her ear like a weight, like one of the dumbbells Alan has had in the far corner of the basement since he was in junior high. She hears herself peep and chirp back at Marsha as the conversation runs from the sorrows and sicknesses of people they know to the sad state of the Colony, how hardly anybody goes to the Association meetings anymore, how they could barely raise a crew to take the raft out of the water this fall, and then finally stalls. “Call soon,” she hears herself say.</p><p>“Yes, I will.”</p><p>“Promise?”</p><p>“Promise.”</p><p>There are half a dozen people she wants to call, she’s so wrought up, but for a long while, as the sun softens and the colors fade from the trees on the far side of the lake, she just sits there, feeling as if someone had died. What will Sid think? Sid’s always had a soft spot for Seldy, as if she were his own daughter, and he’s never liked Richie Spano, never liked what he stood for or where<span data-page="page_8"></span> he came from or how he managed to get his hooks into her.</p><p>And then she’s remembering the time, years ago now, down at the lake, when she snapped awake from a sun-soaked dream to a clamor of voices raised in anger. Sid’s voice she recognized right away, a low buzz of outrage that meant he was right on the verge, but the other voice—a high querulous whine that seemed to choke on itself—she didn’t know.</p><p>It was Richie Spano’s. She turned to look over her shoulder and there he was, incandescent in the light, flailing his arms and screaming in Sid’s face. He didn’t want to wait for a court and he’d been waiting too long already, shouting it out as if he’d been gored, shouting that the whole idea of holding the court when you never lose was just bullshit, that was all. She pushed herself up from the beach chair in the moment that the two of them came at each other—and Sid, though he was slow to anger, could have torn Richie apart, and would have but for the intervention of David, who forced himself between them before the shoves could turn to blows. The next week, at the very next meeting of the Association, she raised her hand and made a motion to ban people from the beach who weren’t members of the Colony—and she named Richie Spano specifically, because whose guest was he, anyway?</p><p>[My memories of Sid are of a man secure in himself, a big man—huge for his generation, six-three and two-twenty and none of it gone to fat—who gave the impression of power held in reserve. He was quick-witted and light on his feet, as verbally wicked as we ourselves were, and if you were admitted to his inner circle—and I was, I was—he would defend you against all comers. He’d fought the Germans, done a stint as a beat cop in Harlem, and then come home to the house on the lake to raise his family. I remember walking into a bar with him once, an unfamiliar place, down and dirty—he must have been in his mid-sixties then—and feeling untouchable, as safe as if I were sitting in my own living room.]</p><p>The tragic days of our lives, the days of accounting, begin like any other, with routine, with the bagel in the toaster and the coffee on the stove. So this is a morning. Sunlight streams through the big picture window, though it’s cold, down to zero overnight, and the lake is sealed beneath a hard uneven tegument of ice so thick you could drive a truck across it. Miriam is feeling good, the pain in her hip subsiding under the ministrations of the prescription the doctor gave her, while Sid, home from work because things are slow, is sitting across the table from her, his head bowed to the paper, jaws working at the bagel she’s smeared with cream cheese and decorated with a transparent wafer of lox and a sprinkle of capers. They’re silent, she absorbed in her thoughts, he in the paper. The only sounds are the little ones, the tap of a spoon on the rim of a cup, the sigh of the knife as it divides another bagel.</p><p>“You want juice?” she says. “Fresh-squeezed, I can make fresh-squeezed, with the oranges Molly sent us from Florida?”</p><p>He glances up from the paper, his eyes a roving watery blue above the little wire-rimmed reading glasses clamped to the bridge of his nose. His fringe of hair, so thin now that it’s barely there, sticks up awkwardly in back. He’s dressed in bluejeans, moccasins, a thin gray sweatshirt she’s washed so many times it’s almost white. “Yeah,” he breathes, “I guess. But don’t go to any trouble.”</p><p>She’s already pushing herself up, about to say, “They’re going to go bad soon anyway,” when she glances reflexively out the window, just as she does a hundred times a day. There’s a scattering of snow like dust over the beach, the lake, the long low building that houses the concession stand. Everything is still, not even a bird moving among the stripped black branches of the trees. Susan says that Miriam needs a hobby, needs to get out more, and maybe she does spend too much time at the window, more interested in what’s outside than what’s here inside the house—if this is what old women do, biddies, yentas, then she guesses she’s one of them.</p><p>But something’s wrong, something’s out of place. She spots it then, a moving shadow in the deeper gloom cast by the overhanging roof of the concession stand, a man there, furtive, jerking back the door and ducking inside. “Sid,” she says, her blood quickening, “there’s somebody out there. I just—I think somebody just broke into the concession stand.”</p><p>“Who? What are you talking about?” He’s set down the paper now and he’s leaning forward to peer out the window, his lips pursed in concentration. “I don’t see anything.”</p><p>“He just went inside. I’m telling you. There’s somebody in there.”</p><p>This is an old story. There’ve always been problems with the place, the lake an irresistible draw for teen-agers looking for trouble, and over the years the outbuildings have periodically been broken into, though there’s not much to steal, not in the off-season. They don’t seem to care. They just want<span data-page="page_final"></span> to smash things, carve epithets into the counters, spray-paint their dirty slogans in the corners where children won’t be able to miss them come summer. It’s been that way since the first truckload of sand was laid down, though it’s worse now, always and progressively worse, because the community isn’t what it was. And never will be.</p><p>Sid doesn’t want to be bothered, she can see that. He thinks she’s crazy, calling him at work every time a strange car pulls into the lot, ringing up the Yorktown cops so many times they don’t even bother to send a patrol car anymore. He’s already turned back to the paper—“It’s nothing, Miriam, nothing, don’t worry yourself”—when she snatches up the binoculars. At first she can’t make out a thing, but then she focusses on the door, and, sure enough, it’s standing open and there’s movement there, a man’s face showing like an image in a slide projector, presented and withdrawn all in the space of an instant. “Sid. Sid!”</p><p>The look he gives her is not a loving look. He sighs in that way he has when he’s feeling put-upon, a sigh that could contain a novel’s worth of martyrdom and resentment. But then she’s handing him the binoculars and he’s standing there at the window, focussing in. After a moment, he emits a low curse. “Son of a bitch,” he mutters, and he strides across the room to the door even as she calls out “Take a coat!” and tries to fumble into her parka and slip on her boots all at the same time.</p><p>By the time she reaches the gates he’s already at the paddleball courts, moving swiftly, his shadow jogging on ahead of him. It’s cold and she’s forgotten her glasses. She digs into her pockets, but can come up with only one mitten. The pain in her hip is back, as sharp as a scalpel. She’s forcing herself on, breathing hard, breathing as if she were about to have a heart attack, when she hears the shouts ring out, and she makes the open door just in time to see Richie Spano, in a black peacoat and with a dark slash of a mustache slicing his face in two, standing over Sid, who’s stretched out supine on the gray concrete floor. What she doesn’t know, not yet, because she hardly ever talks to Marsha anymore, is that Vic Janove, who’s run the concession stand for the past twenty years and who’s become as close to the Goldsteins as she and Sid used to be, has asked Richie, as a favor, to look after the place while he’s in Florida.</p><p>Sid is down on the concrete. He’s sixty-eight years old and he’s just been in a fistfight. And Richie, the breath issuing from his mouth like one of those dialogue balloons in the funny papers, squares his shoulders, swings around, and walks right past her and out the door, and all he says, his voice so fierce and choked he can barely get it out, is “You bitch. You stupid interfering bitch.”</p><p>[This, too, is family legend, though it’s etched in pain. Sid, who had suffered what the neurologists quaintly call an insult to the brain when his head struck the concrete, was too stubborn to go to the doctor. He’d been knocked down before. It was nothing. He took a fistful of aspirin to quell his headache, asked Miriam to make him a cup of tea and maybe some soup, borscht or chicken noodle, it didn’t matter, because he wasn’t really hungry anyway. Three days later, when he finally relented, and she, unsteady on her feet herself, tried to help him down to the car, he collapsed in the driveway. He was dead before she could get the car door open.]</p><p>It’s a Saturday in July, another Saturday, the voices of children careering about her and the steady <em>thwock</em> of the dense black rubber ball punctuating her thoughts. These are new children, of course, the children and grandchildren of her friends and of the new people, too. She barely glances at the men on the paddleball court—they’re interchangeable, their bare legs furred in dark swirls, T-shirts glued to their torsos, sweatbands at their wrists. Their voices rise and fall, immemorial. Someone laughs. A radio buzzes, seeking the signal. <em>Thwock. Thwock</em>. She knows it will all be lost, everything we make, everything we love, everything we are.</p><p>Her eyes close, the sun pressing at her lids like a palpable weight. She can feel everything, every molecule of the hot aluminum slats of the chair and the fading grains of sand. She can taste the air and smell the cold depths of the lake, where no one ever drowns and every child comes home safely. There’s a splashing in the shallows, a dog raising its voice in ecstasy, the sharp tocsin of the lifeguard’s whistle. And then peace, carving out a space where the big green turtles rise lazily from the depths and the geese float free and a little girl, somebody’s daughter, comes wet and shivering to her mother’s sunstruck embrace. ♦</p>	T.

Apple Cake	<p>Her <span data-page="page_1"></span>sisters flinched because she was the youngest, but she looked so old. Jeanne was just seventy-four, and no one had ever thought . . . They didn’t speak of it. They would not allow themselves, but Helen was eighty, Sylvia seventy-eight. They’d married first, been mothers first. They were older. They should have been frailer. How could Jeanne be first to go?</p><p>Their baby sister lay propped up on pillows. Jeanne, who had celebrated her first birthday in eyelet lace, a slice of cake on the tray of her high chair, and her sisters on either side. Their living doll, with her blond curls and round blue eyes. They’d pulled her in their wagon over grass bumpy with apples from the apple tree. It was dreadful to approach her now—her hair just wisps, her voice nearly gone, her cough breaking every sentence. Horror, pity, shame. They felt all that at once, to see her now and to remember her as she had been. They were sorry and they were glad to feel so alive, their steps firm in their low-heeled shoes. Their own bodies sound, rejoicing with each breath. What a terrible thing to say! They would never have admitted it. Their own strength, their own good fortune and their guilt—they could never put it into words. No one should!</p><p>“How are you, darling?” Helen asked.</p><p>Jeanne didn’t answer.</p><p>“Did you see the orchid Richard sent?” Sylvia turned a tall white orchid toward Jeanne’s chair.</p><p>Jeanne glanced at her nephew’s gift. There were so many. Blossoms filled the first-floor music studio where Jeanne had to live because she couldn’t take the stairs. The orchid from Richard, the sunflowers from her daughter-in-law, Melanie, the roses from the Auerbachs next door. Wherever she looked, she saw arrangements from neighbors, nieces, grandchildren. The piano tuner had sent a basket of mums, which were losing petals, shedding everywhere. The cards said, “All our love,” and “Thinking of you,” and even “Healing light.” This from her niece Wendy, the music therapist.</p><p>“Look how beautiful they are,” Sylvia said. She meant, Do you see how much everybody loves you?</p><p>Jeanne made a face. The flowers depressed her, especially those that were already wilting. When she looked at the mums, she felt she wasn’t dying fast enough.</p><p>Her sisters sat chattering about the heat, the traffic, and the rain. They were afraid to leave her alone—although she had lived by herself for fifteen years, a widow. She lived alone because she liked it. Her late husband had been difficult, to say the least.</p><p>According to Jeanne’s sons, her Tudor home was much too big. According to Phoebe, her twenty-year-old granddaughter, Jeanne’s house wasted energy. For years, everybody had been telling Jeanne to move. Now nobody mentioned it.</p><p>These were the privileges of hospice. You didn’t have to blow insulation into your walls. No one suggested assisted living or criticized your carbon footprint, which would disappear entirely in weeks, or even days. On the other hand, everyone came to see you and confide in you. Jeanne didn’t believe in God or any kind of afterlife, but lung cancer made believers of her family, so that she, who despised superstition, became a touchstone and talisman to the rest of them. Her sisters were always pressing her cold hands.</p><p>Helen told Jeanne, “Pam and Wendy are coming up this weekend.”</p><p>Jeanne nodded.</p><p>“Richard’s coming, too,” Sylvia said. Her only child was having a terrible time, switching jobs, divorcing, and she felt he deserved credit for dropping everything to see his aunt. Pam was coming up from Providence, and Wendy lived in Brooklyn, but Richard had to drive all the way from Philly.</p><p>Jeanne closed her eyes and listened to her sisters say, She’s tired. She’s exhausted. She heard them echo and repeat each other. She has to rest. Yes, she has to rest. She was looking at the sun, red through her closed eyelids.</p><p>The autumn sun felt good, but darkness was better, because everybody left except Shawn, the night nurse. Then Jeanne lay awake in her rented hospital bed and listened to symphonies and choral rhapsodies, quartets, and concertos on WGBH, Boston’s classical radio. When she heard a solo violin, her fingers curled reflexively; her left hand knew.</p><p>Her sons had pushed away her music stands and moved the piano to make room for Shawn, now dozing in his straight-backed chair. Jeanne assumed he had another job during the day, and she saw that he was trying to study as well. He was always reading a textbook, but he never got very far. Just before dawn, the book slipped off his lap onto the floor.</p><p>Shawn started up and saw Jeanne staring at him from her bed. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry, Ma’am.” He bent down for the book.</p><p>She said, “You rest.”</p><p>“No, I’m here if you need something.”</p><p>“Sleep.”</p><p>His eyes widened. There was no way he was going back to sleep. He’d lose his job.</p><p>“I’ll let you know if anything happens,” Jeanne said.</p><p>Her sons and their wives came to see her every afternoon. First, Steve and Andrea would sit by her side. Andrea showed videos on her phone of their huge boys, born just eighteen months apart, lion cubs who played high-school soccer. They were coming to see Jeanne right after regionals. Andrea was going to drive them straight from the field, cleats<span data-page="page_2"></span> and all.</p><p>Next came Dan and Melanie. They had just the one daughter, Phoebe. Melanie had gained fifty pounds when she was pregnant. She never had another child, and she never lost the weight. “Phoebe sends her love,” Melanie said.</p><p>Dan explained, “She wants to be here, but she won’t fly.”</p><p>Jeanne tried to picture her ecological granddaughter biking from Ann Arbor. She imagined Phoebe’s long blond hair streaming out from under her helmet. “Her schoolwork is more important.”</p><p>“Actually, she’s taking the semester off,” Melanie said.</p><p>“What was that?”</p><p>Dan frowned, upset with Melanie for mentioning this. “She says she wants to work with her hands.”</p><p>“Preferably in the dirt,” Melanie said. “She wants to be a farmer and write poetry.”</p><p>Jeanne couldn’t help laughing. Her breath came short and quick. For a few moments, she couldn’t breathe at all, and then she couldn’t see. With help from her day nurse, Lorraine, Jeanne sat up, and wiped the tears from her eyes.</p><p>“I don’t think dropping out is funny,” Dan said.</p><p>“She isn’t dropping out,” Melanie said. “She just needs a little time.”</p><p>Jeanne croaked, “Let her do what she wants.”</p><p>Dan and Melanie looked crushed, and Jeanne felt sorry for them—but why did everyone expect her to be so concerned?</p><p>Illness did not bring out the angel in her. At first, she’d appreciated visitors, but as she lingered on they didn’t leave. Her sisters kept bringing in their middle-aged children—for what? Goodbyes? Advice? Some final blessing? Sylvia begged, “Tell Richard to stop smoking!”</p><p>Oh, really, Jeanne thought. That’s what I am. Exhibit A. She studied her ruddy nephew. His wife had just won custody of the children, and the dog. “I enjoyed smoking,” Jeanne said. “Your mother did, too.”</p><p>Sylvia shrank back as though Jeanne had struck her, but she said nothing. It was too late, apparently, to retaliate.</p><p>Jeanne’s sons appeared, and they looked terrible, both of them. Dan wore wire-rimmed glasses. He was thick in the middle and he had hardly any hair. It amused and saddened Jeanne to see him look so much like his late father. As for Steve, he had a bad back, so he had to walk around the room. He made Jeanne dizzy, pacing up and down.</p><p>Her daughters-in-law got emotional—especially Melanie, herself a doctor. Please, Jeanne thought. I lost my parents when I was half your age. We’re all over fifty here.</p><p>She pretended to sleep, and then she really did drop off. When she woke, her sisters were hovering over her. Some of us have overstayed our welcome, Jeanne thought. And then, with sudden shock, No: I’m the one. That would be me.</p><p>Sardonic as she was, husk that she was, she shuddered at the thought of disappearing, of losing consciousness and irony, her music, her unrenovated house, her sun. Cancer had consumed her body, drugs clouded her mind. Even so, Jeanne held on. Barely eating, scarcely speaking, she endured. Her nieces and her nephew sat with her. Wendy sang and strummed her battered guitar. Jeanne’s soccer-playing grandsons arrived. Zach cracked his knuckles. Nate jiggled his right leg. The boys were like a pair of jackrabbits, all ears and feet.</p><p>The hospice nurses said that Jeanne would drift away in a day or two, but four days passed, and then a fifth. It was awkward, because her sons had to take off work, and her grandchildren could miss only so many days of school. Should they stay or should they go? Did it make sense to return home and then come right back for the funeral?</p><p>Helen said, “We need a plan.” Oldest and bossiest, she told Jeanne, “We need to know your wishes.”</p><p>“To get up,” Jeanne said immediately.</p><p>Later, in the hall, Sylvia turned on Helen. “How can you speak to her like that?”</p><p>Helen was amazed at the question. “Well, we can’t ask her when she’s gone!”</p><p>Sylvia began to cry.</p><p>“Don’t get hysterical,” Helen snapped.</p><p>“I’m not hysterical. I have feelings. Be considerate.”</p><p>“I am considerate,” Helen said. “I’m doing for Jeanne what I hope someone would do for me. If I didn’t have a living will.”</p><p>Weeping, Sylvia retreated to the dining room to criticize her husband, Lew.</p><p>That afternoon, at Jeanne’s bedside, Helen appealed to her daughter Pam, a tax attorney. “She left no instructions.”</p><p>At the word “instructions,” Jeanne opened her eyes. It was disconcerting the way she did that. Just as Helen slipped into the past tense, Jeanne roused herself. Then everyone hurried to her side again.</p><p>Sons and daughters-in-law watched Jeanne’s face.</p><p>“Melanie,” Jeanne whispered.</p><p>“What is it?” Melanie asked. Already the tears. Always the tears.</p><p>“Half a bagel,” Jeanne said.</p><p>That sent them off again, scrambling to Rosenfeld’s. The two couples took Dan’s Volvo to Newton Centre, even as they told each other there was no way. Melanie, the doctor, said, “She’ll never eat a whole half a bagel.”</p><p>“Does that matter?” Dan demanded, as he drove.</p><p>“No,” Melanie said. “Of course not.”</p><p>“If my mother wants half a bagel, she’s getting half a bagel.”</p><p>Melanie said, “No poppy. She could aspirate the seeds.”</p><p>“Get her an egg bagel,” Steve suggested from the back seat.</p><p>Andrea corrected him. “She doesn’t like egg. She likes plain.”</p><p>By the time they returned with a dozen bagels, two large containers of whipped cream cheese, a side of lox, and a chocolate<span data-page="page_3"></span> babka, Jeanne was sleeping again.</p><p>The nurses stopped predicting when she would drift away. Now they said that only Jeanne would know when it was time. Lorraine suggested that everybody share a moment. Was there unfinished business in the family? Sometimes people had to forgive each other before they could let go.</p><p>Tremulous, angelic, Sylvia told Helen, “I forgive you.”</p><p>“Oh, for God’s sake,” Helen said. There was nothing to forgive. There was simply the great divide between them: Helen told the truth, while Sylvia tried to paper over everything.</p><p>“She never listens to me,” Sylvia told the family assembled at Jeanne’s bedside. “I’m invisible to her.”</p><p>Amazed at this mixed metaphor, Helen said, “Obviously I see you.”</p><p>At this point, Dan spoke up. “I think we need to focus on the time we have together.”</p><p>“Amen,” Lorraine said, and everyone was jealous, because she liked Dan best.</p><p>Look at you, Jeanne thought. All vying for attention! Even so, she forgave everybody. Good night, she told them silently. Farewell. She wished that she could send a blanket dispensation. After which she could stay and they would leave.</p><p>In fact, she looked a little better. She drank some juice and tried a bite of toast. She asked for her violin. She couldn’t play it. She couldn’t even open the case, but she kept it near her on the window ledge next to her bed. She wanted her instrument where she could see it.</p><p>Like a cat, Jeanne slept most of the day, but, waking, she seemed a heightened, sharper version of herself. When Pam drove up from Providence for the second time, Jeanne asked why she’d never married. When Melanie sniffled, Jeanne said, “Stop feeling sorry for yourself.”</p><p>Obviously, Melanie was sad because she was afraid of her own death. Jeanne could see it in her eyes. Jeanne’s sisters were even worse. They looked at her and thought only of their mortality.</p><p>But this was cruel! Not just unkind. Untrue. Jeanne’s sisters thought nothing of themselves. Sylvia berated Lew all the way home to Weston. Helen stayed up late in Brookline, baking. Lemon squares, and brownies, pecan bars, apple cake, sandy almond cookies. Alone in her kitchen, she wrapped these offerings in waxed paper and froze them in tight-lipped containers.</p><p>Her husband, Charles, ventured, “You should get some rest.”</p><p>What a thing to say! How could anybody rest? Helen had not pursued a career like Jeanne, the music teacher, or three successive husbands, like Sylvia. No, Helen had always been a homemaker. Now her family needed sustenance, so she doubled every recipe and froze half. After all, there would be a memorial service, and shivah afterward. Helen could already picture Jeanne’s students descending with their parents. Sylvia hadn’t baked in years, because Lew was diabetic. As for Melanie and Andrea—what would they throw together? A box of doughnut holes? No. Helen was the baker of the family. What she felt could not be purchased. She grieved from scratch.</p><p>And yet Jeanne kept on living. Her sisters held vigil; her sons came up on weekends. In the kitchen, her family nibbled Helen’s lemon squares. Melanie urged brownies on the nurses. “Take these,” she told Lorraine. “We can’t eat them all, but Helen won’t stop baking.”</p><p>“Sweetheart,” Lorraine said, “everybody mourns in her own way.”</p><p>Helen mourned her sister deeply. She arrived each day with shopping bags. Her cake was tender with sliced apples, but her almond cookies crumbled at the touch. Her pecan bars were awful, sticky-sweet and hard enough to break your teeth. They remained untouched in the dining room, because Helen never threw good food away.</p><p>Sometimes Jeanne asked in a confused voice why everyone had come. And then there were moments when she remembered and took charge. She ordered Melanie to take all the plants and flowers to Newton-Wellesley Hospital. She told Wendy to put her guitar away. After this, she asked to speak to her sons alone. She lay in bed and watched Dan and Steve approach. This is it, the two of them were thinking. “We’ll see,” Jeanne said.</p><p>Guilty, nervous, Steve asked, “What did you say?”</p><p>“These are my wishes,” Jeanne said.</p><p>Dan pulled up a chair, but Steve paced up and down.</p><p>“Stop that.”</p><p>“What are your wishes?” Dan asked.</p><p>“First of all”—Jeanne looked at Steve—“don’t pace. Second of all . . .”</p><p>They waited.</p><p>“No funeral.”</p><p>“A private burial?” Dan ventured.</p><p>“No burial.”</p><p>Astonished, Steve said, “You have the plot.” He might as well have added, And it’s paid for.</p><p>“I don’t want it.”</p><p>Steve protested, “But it’s next to Dad.”</p><p>“Yes, I am aware of that.”</p><p>Dan’s glasses were fogging up. He took them off and wiped them on the bottom of his sweater. “You shared your life with Dad for thirty-eight years.”</p><p>“Exactly.”</p><p>If Jeanne had another plan, she did not reveal it to her sons. If she had a good word to say about their father, she did not say it. Fiercely, she insisted that there would be no burial. No memorial. Privately, she decided not to die.</p><p>Jeanne’s voice grew stronger as she kept living. Outside, the leaves were turning. AAA Sparkling Windows and Gutters called to schedule a cleaning. Still, she endured.</p><p>Uneasily, the family dispersed. Jeanne’s grandsons returned to school. Jeanne’s sons and their wives went back to work. Even Melanie stopped crying.<span data-page="page_4"></span> Her mother-in-law was a medical miracle. She was going to outlast them all. Only the nurses kept the faith. Lorraine said that sometimes older people held on for an occasion. They willed themselves to stay alive for one final milestone. A wedding. A grandchild’s graduation.</p><p>No one could think of a milestone, apart from Richard’s divorce. Nobody was marrying or graduating. The next family birthday was in May. Everyone had shared a moment. Nieces and nephew and grandchildren had . . . Wait! They’d forgotten Phoebe, writing poetry in Michigan, working with her hands, refusing to fly.</p><p>Melanie and Dan spoke to Phoebe on the phone. They called her from Jeanne’s house, and then Melanie called again from the car as Dan drove home. She talked to Phoebe about respect and compassion—thinking about others, not just about the earth.</p><p>Meanwhile, Helen and Sylvia kept coming every day, baleful, fearful, sorry for their lot. Helen wanted to bring her rabbi to the house.</p><p>“No rabbis,” Jeanne said. “No members of the clergy.”</p><p>“Well, what would you suggest?” Helen demanded.</p><p>Sylvia cried, “How dare you scream at her?”</p><p>“Only one of us is screaming,” Helen said.</p><p>Sylvia left the room, and then she left the house. Maybe she raised her voice at times. Maybe she felt overwhelmed. The situation was overwhelming. Jeanne’s death unimaginable, and now—even worse—postponed. There was nothing to be done, and yet Helen managed to do it. As usual, she took over everything. Sylvia was up all night, she was so upset. “It’s all about Helen,” Sylvia told Lew. “Her plan, her rabbi, her stale old pecan bars.”</p><p>Columbus Day, when the family gathered at the house, Sylvia arrived with fresh-baked apple cake, warm from her oven, fragrant in its pan.</p><p>Heads up, suddenly alert, Jeanne’s huge grandsons sniffed the cake. Can I have a piece? Can I have some?</p><p>In the kitchen, Sylvia turned the cake out on a plate and sliced big wedges for the boys. Then Dan and Melanie had pieces, as did Steve and Andrea. In the dining room, Helen’s defrosted brownies, pecan bars, and almond cookies sat undisturbed. Charles did take a brownie out of loyalty, but he slipped into the kitchen for Sylvia’s cake.</p><p>“I smell baked apples,” Jeanne whispered in the studio. The bed seemed to swallow her up, and yet she spoke.</p><p>“It’s my recipe,” Helen said. “I gave that recipe to Sylvia twenty years ago.”</p><p>“Yes, I remember,” Jeanne said. “She bakes a very good apple cake.”</p><p>“I bake the same one! I brought you apple cake last week!”</p><p>“I know, but I like hers better,” Jeanne said.</p><p>Helen marched into the kitchen and gazed at the last crumbs of Sylvia’s cake. Zach and Nate were eating standing up. Melanie and Dan, Steve and Andrea, were eating at the table. Then Helen caught her own husband throwing away a paper plate.</p><p>“<em>Et tu</em>, Charles,” Lew said.</p><p>“You used my recipe,” Helen told Sylvia.</p><p>“Yes, I did,” Sylvia replied, with such an air that even Zach and Nate knew she meant, What’s it to you?</p><p>The next day, Sylvia brought her homemade jelly rolls, soft sponges rolled with tangy apricot, dusted on top with coconut flakes. She had not baked jelly rolls in fifteen years, and the whole family fell upon them. Even Lew, so careful with his diet, took a tiny piece. Only Helen and Jeanne abstained. Helen would not, and Jeanne could not partake.</p><p>She was sick of visitors, but she made an effort to say a few words to each one. She advised her younger son, Dan, to look into hair-replacement therapy. She told Melanie to try antidepressants. Maybe they would help her lose some weight. As for Steve and Andrea, they were neglecting music. Neither of their boys played an instrument. Jeanne told Andrea to look into marching band, since the boys loved sports so much. Or, if they refused to practice, there were youth choirs. With some ear training, they might learn to sing.</p><p>Andrea was speechless for a moment. Then she said slowly, “I realize that music is important to you.”</p><p>“My life,” Jeanne whispered.</p><p>“Would you like to see your students?” Steve asked.</p><p>Jeanne thought of her young violinists—George, with his sweet tone and his tendency to rush. Sophie, who forgot to count. Wyatt had a good ear but didn’t work at all. Emma would not relax her tight goat-trill vibrato.</p><p>Andrea said, “Would you like some of them to come and play for you?”</p><p>“God, no,” Jeanne said.</p><p>Sisters, sons, daughters-in-law were always begging to know what they could do. Jeanne gazed out the window at her sugar maple, and she told them what she wanted, since they asked.</p><p>They carried her into the garden, where she could see the trees. Tethered to her wheelchair and to her oxygen, she turned her face up to the fiery maples, the gold oaks, the breezy sky. How good the world smelled, the fresh damp grass.</p><p>She leaned back and she smiled, and her family thought she was at peace. They were wrong. She was not at peace; quite the opposite. She was happy. Full of plans.</p><p>She told Helen she would see the rabbi. She would have a conversation with him. “Thank you,” Helen said.</p><p>Rabbi Lieberman, when he arrived the next day, looked about twelve. He could have come for lessons. He wore<span data-page="page_5"></span> a suit, but he seemed to Jeanne not much bigger than a child.</p><p>“Jeanne wanted to have a conversation with you,” Helen said.</p><p>Jeanne told the rabbi, “You should know that I’m an atheist.”</p><p>The rabbi nodded. “Yes, I understand.”</p><p>Jeanne added, “I don’t have time for organized religion.”</p><p>“You’re in good company,” the rabbi said.</p><p>Jeanne frowned to find him so accommodating. Didn’t rabbis believe anything anymore? “But you believe in God,” she said.</p><p>“I do.”</p><p>Jeanne looked at Helen. “That’s a relief, ” she said.</p><p>“You see?” Helen told her sister, and she meant, You see, it’s a relief, a comfort to think of the Creator. “You see?”</p><p>“Belief is very personal,” the rabbi said.</p><p>“I agree,” Jeanne said. “That’s why we should keep it to ourselves.”</p><p>The rabbi smiled.</p><p>“My family would like to bury me.”</p><p>Helen broke in. “You know that’s not true.”</p><p>“They want to bury me next to my late husband,” Jeanne said. “I would like to go somewhere else.”</p><p>“Where would you like to go?”</p><p>“I’d like to be scattered,” Jeanne said.</p><p>“Cremated?” Rabbi Lieberman asked delicately.</p><p>“That’s not Jewish,” Helen declared.</p><p>Jeanne looked at the rabbi, who seemed reluctant to speak.</p><p>“It’s not our tradition,” the rabbi said at last.</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>“And how will we visit you?” Helen demanded.</p><p>Jeanne said, “Why do you assume that I want visitors?”</p><p>Helen’s tears startled Jeanne. Not you, she thought. Helen never cried.</p><p>“I would visit,” Helen said.</p><p>“Oh, fine,” Jeanne said. “Go ahead and bury me. I won’t mind.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Helen whispered.</p><p>After all, Jeanne reasoned, she would never feel it. She wouldn’t even know. “Do what you want,” she told her sister. “Cover me with rocks.”</p><p>They wore her down. They came in shifts. Jeanne closed her eyes and listened to the house. Doors closing. Water running. The crackle of crumbs flying up the vacuum cleaner. Raised voices. Furious words. Helen baked mandelbrot from their mother Esther’s recipe. Sylvia countered with Esther’s honey cake.</p><p>Jeanne tasted none of it, but she remained the cause, the crux of the matter, the still fixed point of the entire family. How long had she been sleeping? When would she wake? She was as surprised as anyone to find herself alive each morning. She opened her eyes and everyone turned to her as to an oracle. She did her best to keep them busy. “Take a day off,” she told Helen. “Serve on a committee.” She turned to Sylvia. “Bring me another apple cake.”</p><p>“You’re angry at me,” Helen told Jeanne later when they were alone.</p><p>Jeanne shook her head.</p><p>“You’re angry because I have beliefs.”</p><p>Jeanne said, “I don’t hold any of your beliefs against you.” She said this, but she added silently, I do think less of you.</p><p>“Sylvia covers her apples with brown sugar,” Helen said. “She sugars everything.”</p><p>“Of course she does,” Jeanne said. After all, people liked sweet things. Anything sweet and easy. The bitter, dark, and complicated could not compete. This had always pained her before, but she enjoyed the injustice of it now. Joy mixed with fear as she looked out the window and saw scarlet trees. How dazzling the world was. How strange.</p><p>She heard voices at her door and saw a beautiful girl, dressed all in rags. At last, her granddaughter, Phoebe, had arrived with her gold hair trailing down her back. She’d come on the bus from Michigan, and she’d brought a young man, a huntsman in a rough leather shirt.</p><p>Jeanne clasped her granddaughter’s hand, but Phoebe started back, shocked by Jeanne’s ghastly face.</p><p>Oh, you’re afraid of me, Jeanne thought. Grandmother, what big eyes you have, what withered cheeks.</p><p>“Sharp nails,” Phoebe murmured, looking down at Jeanne’s claws.</p><p>The wolf inside Jeanne whispered, The better to eat you with, my dear. But Jeanne said, “Introduce me.”</p><p>Phoebe didn’t understand.</p><p>Jeanne turned to Phoebe’s deerslayer. “What’s your name?”</p><p>“I’m Christian.”</p><p>Jeanne had no breath, but laughter racked her body anyway. She held on to Phoebe, and she began to shake.</p><p>Dan and Melanie did not find Phoebe’s boyfriend funny, nor did they laugh about his name. He was twenty-eight years old, without a full-time job. He said he wanted to raise blueberries. They did not appreciate meeting him like this. They did not appreciate meeting him at all. He sat on the couch with his arms wrapped around Phoebe, as though she belonged to him. They couldn’t even have a conversation with their daughter. And yet Christian withstood every hint and every disapproving look. He nuzzled their only child, and he ate. Unblinking, he finished off Helen’s pecan bars. He devoured Sylvia’s apple cake.</p><p>Now that Phoebe had arrived, Jeanne was supposed to let go, but she stayed alive to gaze at Phoebe’s lovely face. “Where’s your violin?” she asked.</p><p>Phoebe looked down at her hiking boots.</p><p>“You sold it, didn’t you?”</p><p>Phoebe began to cry.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter. In the grand scheme of things . . .”</p><p>Phoebe waited for Jeanne. Then she said, “What is it?”</p><p>Oh, who can remember, Jeanne thought. Maybe she was sleeping. It was hard to tell. She could have been dreaming, or talking in her sleep. “You played well, but other people play much better.”</p><p>“Thanks, Grandma,” Phoebe said, and suddenly Jeanne saw her as a little child, golden-haired, sitting on the beach.<span data-page="page_6"></span> She could see Phoebe sand-dusted in her bathing suit. The rippling tide around her, deep-blue waves, white foam.</p><p>Jeanne lost consciousness the next day. Dan and Steve kissed their mother’s forehead. Once more, everybody said goodbye, but another day passed, and then a third. Finally, at night, when she was all alone except for Shawn, Jeanne cried out.</p><p>“Mrs. Rubinstein!” He tried to make her comfortable, but she fought him. She didn’t want help. She wanted to open her eyes, to rise up from her bed. She wanted music and she wanted apples. She wanted to touch the sandy beach, to feel summer’s heat. She wanted all this, but she couldn’t have it. She died because she couldn’t breathe.</p><p>In the morning, Jeanne’s sons tried to make arrangements. Everybody sat in the dining room, and Helen insisted that her rabbi lead prayers.</p><p>Sylvia turned on her. “She said no memorial service. You know she hated organized religion!”</p><p>“Stop shrieking at me,” Helen said.</p><p>“We are honoring Jeanne’s life, not yours.”</p><p>Dan intervened. “A simple burial.”</p><p>“No service,” Steve added.</p><p>“But she didn’t want a burial,” Sylvia reminded them.</p><p>Helen drew herself up. “She said fine.”</p><p>“Because you pressured her!”</p><p>“I would never pressure anyone,” Helen said.</p><p>“Oh, really!”</p><p>“She told me fine.”</p><p>“Nobody else heard her.”</p><p>“The rabbi heard.”</p><p>“Because the two of you were pressuring her into it.”</p><p>“For the last time, she wasn’t pressured. She said yes. Bury me.”</p><p>“Because she was dying! That’s why she agreed.”</p><p>Even as they argued in the dining room, the rental company came to collect Jeanne’s cannisters of oxygen. Someone was on the phone about the hospital bed, now stripped bare.</p><p>“She wanted to be scattered,” Sylvia declared.</p><p>“She said, Bury me. She told the rabbi.”</p><p>“She didn’t believe in rabbis!”</p><p>“Does that mean he never existed?” Helen shot back. “Does that mean the conversation never happened?”</p><p>“Stop,” Dan begged them, but they would not stop.</p><p>“As far as you’re concerned,” Sylvia said, “the only conversations that happen are the ones happening to you.”</p><p>Now Helen lost her temper entirely. “I asked her to make plans, and you accused me of having no feelings! I talked about instructions, because I knew this was going to happen!”</p><p>“She stated her wishes a thousand times.” Sylvia spoke with resolve. “She said she wanted to be scattered.”</p><p>“That is what she said,” Dan admitted.</p><p>“She never wavered,” Sylvia told Helen.</p><p>“She changed her mind!” Helen cried out, but no one believed her. Once, Helen had been the sane one. Now they treated her as though she were delusional. Sylvia had begun the insurrection. She’d waged this war for weeks. Helen’s voice broke, even as she appealed to them all. “Jeanne talked to the rabbi and she said, Bury me, and that’s the truth!”</p><p>Sylvia fixed her eyes on Helen. “Don’t get hysterical.”</p><p>But of course it wasn’t up to them. Dan and Steve made all the plans. They interpreted their mother’s wishes. There would be no burial, just a celebration of Jeanne’s life.</p><p>Privately, their wives spoke to Sylvia and Helen. They said that the reception after the service would be catered, and for the sake of the family they requested no homemade desserts. They asked Jeanne’s sisters to promise. No cookies, no pecan bars. Absolutely no cake.</p><p>“I will do whatever you decide,” Helen said with dignity.</p><p>“And so will I,” Sylvia said.</p><p>Helen added, “I would never use an occasion like this to call attention to myself.”</p><p>No rabbi spoke at the celebration of Jeanne’s life. Jeanne’s student Emma Kantor played Bach, and Dan spoke about how Jeanne’s music had filled the house. Steve talked about what he had learned from his mother: “Don’t quit. Don’t feel sorry for yourself. Don’t just stand there, do something.” These were the lessons he remembered, although Jeanne’s actual words had been “Don’t pace.”</p><p>In the front row of the funeral chapel, Sylvia sat wearing tinted glasses. She didn’t think that she could speak. However, when the time came she walked up to the lectern and the words began to come. She’d written them all down on college-ruled paper.</p><p>“All my friends were jealous when she was born,” Sylvia said. “But I didn’t even let them touch her. She was a perfect baby and an angel. From the time she was born, she was my special charge. I used to dress her and play with her. I was her teacher when we played school on the porch. And this is why . . . this is why it’s so difficult . . . impossible to . . .”</p><p>Sylvia broke down, and her son rushed to the lectern to comfort her, which made her cry even more. How could he keep smoking after all this? How could his wife, his college sweetheart, leave him?</p><p>Lew was standing. He helped her take her seat, and she sat between the two of them, her husband and her son, and the tears kept coming—until Helen began to speak.</p><p>“It is perhaps appropriate that I speak last, because I am the oldest,” Helen said. “And yet I have no monopoly on my sister. Like every human, she belonged to many people, not just one. She had parents.” Helen stared straight at Sylvia. “She had two older sisters. She was a beloved member of our family. Daughter, sister, mother, cousin, friend.<span data-page="page_final"></span> She was a musician. She was a teacher who spent countless hours instructing children. She was not sentimental, but she was giving.”</p><p>Now Sylvia took off her glasses. Now she wiped the last tears from her eyes.</p><p>“She did not love tradition,” Helen said, “but in her final days she spoke of God.”</p><p>“Not true!” Sylvia whispered to Lew.</p><p>“She talked about belief.”</p><p>Louder, Sylvia whispered to her husband, “That’s just not true!”</p><p>As Helen spoke, Sylvia rattled her notes, her own words left unsaid. She wanted to stand up and finish her eulogy. She wanted to deliver her bright version of Jeanne’s life, the true picture, unvarnished with religion, but it was too late. Already Helen was speaking about eternity. Already she was reciting Kaddish.</p><p>Sylvia wanted to cry out and stop the prayer. She whispered loud enough for those around her to hear, “This is not what Jeanne wanted!” Apart from that, she suffered in silence. She would not ruin the memorial. She would never make a scene.</p><p>To close the service, Jeanne’s twelve-year-old student, George Leong, played the Meditation on a Theme from “Thaïs.” He didn’t rush until the last cascading phrases at the end. Horse knows the way, Jeanne would have said.</p><p>After the celebration, the family convened at Jeanne’s house to sit shivah for one day. No one could take off another week. Silent, staring, Helen watched the caterers serve quiche and crudités and sweet noodle kugel in a silver chafing dish. Fresh-fruit platters stood in for dessert, along with factory-made cookies and weak coffee.</p><p>In the living room, Melanie and Andrea tried to comfort friends and neighbors who were shaken by Jeanne’s passing. Several confided that Jeanne’s sudden death had prompted them to enjoy life while they could. The Auerbachs next door had decided to tour the Galápagos Islands. After that, they hoped to see the northern lights. They had a list.</p><p>In Jeanne’s studio, Dan and Steve and their cousins, Pam, Wendy, and Richard, talked about how they used to play Wiffle ball together in the back yard. Someone asked Helen to look for the photo albums, but she sat in a daze. As for Sylvia, she was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Late in the day, just as the guests began to leave, Sylvia slipped into the house. Sober, Lew followed, carrying a tube pan.</p><p>“Lew?” Andrea said in a warning voice. “What is that?”</p><p>Lew kept moving. He knew that this was the nuclear option, and he felt culpable, but he loved his wife.</p><p>In the dining room, Sylvia sliced her fresh-baked apple cake. The caterers were still packing up. Their chafing dishes were hardly cold when the house filled with the cake’s fragrance. Jeanne’s grandsons ran straight to the table. Christian appeared with Phoebe right behind him.</p><p>The scent of apples woke Helen from her trance. She marched into the dining room and saw the family eating; she saw what Sylvia had done, and her eyes brightened; her whole body tensed with indignation.</p><p>That was the end.</p><p>Melanie tried. Everybody tried. Nobody could reconcile Jeanne’s sisters. This was all a misunderstanding, their children said. Don’t be stubborn, their children pleaded. Andrea said that they only had each other now, but they refused to listen. Dan said life was short. They didn’t care. In fact, they knew it wasn’t true. Their lives were long.</p><p>Lorraine was right. Everybody mourned in his or her own way. Phoebe wrote a poem, and Melanie did in fact start taking antidepressants. Richard began dating a woman he’d met at a bar. Pam adopted a shelter dog. As for Jeanne’s sisters, they would not forgive each other for Jeanne’s death. They would not reconcile, not even when the whole family gathered at Singing Beach in the spring to scatter Jeanne’s ashes in the ocean. Wendy stood on the sand and asked the sisters, in Jeanne’s memory, to open their hearts and to embrace each other so that they might begin to heal, but no, not even then. ♦</p>	Allegra Goodman	July 7, 2014 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/07/07/apple-cake	Baking	Books	Death	Dying	Faith	Families	Jeanne	Third	Death
Aspic	<p>Truth <span data-page="page_1"></span>be told, I’ve always been afraid of it, since childhood. It’s prepared not casually, or whenever the fancy strikes you, but most often for New Year’s Eve, in the heart of winter, in the shortest and most brutal days of December. Darkness comes early. There is a damp frost; you can see spiky halos around the street lamps. You have to breathe through your mittens. Your forehead aches from the cold, and your cheeks are numb. But, wouldn’t you know it, you still have to boil and chill the aspic—the name of the dish itself makes the temperature of your soul drop, and no thick gray goat-hair shawl will save you. It’s a special kind of religion, making the aspic. It’s a yearly sacrifice, though we don’t know to whom or for what. And what would happen if you didn’t make it is also a question mark.</p><p>But, for some reason, it must be done.</p><p>You must walk in the cold to the market—it’s always dim there, never warm there. Past the tubs with pickled things, past the cream and the crème fraîche redolent of girlish innocence, past the artillery depot of potatoes, radishes, and cabbages, past the hills of fruit, past the signal lights of clementines—to the farthest corner. That’s where the chopping block is; that’s where the blood and the axe are. “Call Russia to the Axe.” To this one right here, digging its blade into a wooden stump. Russia is here, Russia is picking out a piece of meat.</p><p>“Igor, chop up the legs for the lady.” Igor lifts his axe: <em>hack!</em> Lays out the white cow knees, cleaves the shanks. Some buy pieces of the muzzle: lips and nostrils. And those who like pork broth—they get little pig feet with baby hooves. Holding one of those, touching its yellow skin, is creepy—what if it suddenly shook your hand in return?</p><p>None of them are really dead: that’s the conundrum. There is no death. They are hacked apart, mutilated; they won’t be walking anywhere, or even crawling; they’ve been killed but they are not dead. They know that you’ve come for them.</p><p>Next it’s time to buy something dry and clean: onions, garlic, roots, and herbs. And back home through the snow you go: <em>crunch</em>, <em>crunch</em>. The frosty building entryway. The light bulb has been stolen again. You fumble in the dark for the elevator button; its red eye lights up. First the intestines appear in the elevator’s wrought-iron cage, then the cabin itself. Our ancient St. Petersburg lifts are slow; they click as they pass each floor, testing our patience. The chopped-up legs in the shopping bag are pulling your arm down, and it seems as if at the very last moment they’ll refuse to get into the elevator. They’ll twitch, break free, and run away, clacking across the ceramic tile: <em>clippity-clop</em>, <em>clippity-clop</em>, <em>clippity-clop</em>. Maybe that would be for the best? No. It’s too late.</p><p>At home, you wash them and throw them into the pot. You set the burner on high.</p><p>Now it’s boiling, raging. Now the surface is coated with gray, dirty ripples: all that’s bad, all that’s weighty, all that’s fearful, all that suffered, darted, and tried to break loose, oinked and mooed, couldn’t understand, resisted, and gasped for breath—all of it turns to muck. All the pain and all the death are gone, congealed into repugnant fluffy felt. <em>Finito</em>. Placidity, forgiveness.</p><p>Then it’s time to dump this death water, to thoroughly rinse the sedated pieces under a running faucet, and to put them back into a clean pot filled with fresh water. It’s simply meat, simply food; all that was fearsome is gone. A calm blue flower of propane, just a little bit of heat. Let it simmer quietly; this is a five-to-six-hour undertaking.</p><p>While it cooks, you can take your time preparing the herbs and the onions. You’ll be adding them to the pot in two batches. First, two hours before the broth finishes cooking, and then, again, an hour later. Don’t forget to stir in plenty of salt. And your labor is done. By the end of the cooking cycle, there will have been a complete transfiguration of flesh: the pot will be a lake of gold with fragrant meat, and nothing, nothing will remind us of Igor.</p><p>The kids are here; they are looking at the pot, unafraid. It’s safe to show them this soup—they won’t ask any tough questions.</p><p>Strain the broth, pull the meat apart, slice it with a sharp knife, as they did in the olden days, in the age of the tsar, and the other tsar, and the third tsar, before the advent of the meat grinder, before Vasily the Blind, and Ivan Kalita, and the Cumans, and Rurik, and Sineus and Truvor, who, as it turns out, never even existed.</p><p>Set up the bowls and the plates and place some fresh-pressed garlic in each one. Add the chopped-up meat. Use the ladle to pour over it some thick, golden, gelatinous broth. And that’s that. Your job is done; the rest is up to the frost. Carefully take the bowls and plates out to the balcony, cover the coffins with lids, stretch some plastic wrap over them, and wait.</p><p>Might as well stay out on the balcony, bundled up in your shawl. Smoke a cigarette and look up at the winter stars,<span data-page="page_final"></span> unable to identify a single one. Think about tomorrow’s guests, remind yourself that you need to iron the tablecloth, to add sour cream to the horseradish, to warm the wine and chill the vodka, to grate some cold butter, to place the sauerkraut in a dish, to slice some bread. To wash your hair, to dress up, to do your makeup—foundation, mascara, lipstick.</p><p>And if you feel like senselessly crying do it now, while nobody can see you. Do it violently, about nothing and for no reason, sobbing, wiping away your tears with your sleeve, stubbing out your cigarette against the railing of the balcony, not finding it there, and burning your fingers. Because how to reach this <em>there</em> and where this <em>there</em> is—no one knows. ♦</p><p><em>(Translated, from the Russian, by Anya Migdal.)</em></p>	Tatyana Tolstaya	January 25, 2016 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/01/25/aspic-fiction-tatyana-tolstaya	Animals	Books	Childhood	Cooking	Death	Families	Reader	Second	Death
Back the Way You Went	<p>Because she has a broken heart and then her mother dies, D and F take her with them on a weekend getaway. The getaway place is a honeycomb. Bees stream through the streets and the night. Bees huddling, zooming, gleaming and anxious, bees rolling along like sailors, bees licking the barley out of one another’s beards. D and F are bees, too, and go ahead to guide her on the stream. The stream is drunk. They stumble to their rented house. I’ll be fine, she thinks.</p><p>Next day they rent bikes. D and F swoop off down the bike path. She pumps hard, grinds to a halt on a dune, bruises her leg, starts again. This happens forty-five times. I haven’t ridden a bike since I was ten, she explains to no one. Sweat drips down both sides of her nose. Even then Dad gave up on me. Two days down, she thinks.</p><p>On the porch in the morning, a feral cat dozes by the picnic table while D eats muesli and reads aloud from <em>Men’s Muscle</em>. Please may I have another, sir (protein supplement). Photos of men who have transferred the insides of their bodies to the outside by pulling on chains while lightning comes from their heads. Others heft anvils in white shirts and ties. As one reads Gogol (Nabokov observed), one’s eyes become “gogolized”—people passionate about overcoats begin to appear in towns that never knew cold or snow. Will I perhaps see mega pec cables romping the rosy lanes of the honeycomb today? she wonders.</p><p>To pass the time, she eavesdrops (café). Are you tempted? I’ve always been tempted. Well, so, should I? Can’t we just be free and like this? I think it’s crazy unless you’re really, really. And you see if I lost, then I’d be. I didn’t know you felt that way or I would’ve said thanks, but. It’s a difficult situation now. Remember, we didn’t even recognize the ice-skater. Oh, I know. A fantasy is not a person. But I miss it like a person. And then the day ends with a churningly stupid argument between D and F in the front courtyard of a restaurant. She has a chunk of seared tuna stuck in her throat the whole time. You want me to be someone else. I want you to be nothing. That’s metaphysically impossible. Oh, go away.</p><p>Years later, when they are no longer together, she wonders what it was like for D and F to be thugging her around behind them like an extra leg, up and down the bright boardwalks, in and out of dark shops, where they tried on outfits and she wept, past terraces and bars and hooting and sexpools and other people’s flyoff protocols. She’d returned to the rented house caked with filthy honey and lain on her back on the camp bed.</p><p>At the beach (last day), she looks down and thinks, I have my mother’s toes. She is reading only books written by people named Margaret, so as to feel close to her. Not too close. Her poor toes. In therapy (try to remember the good times), she’d come up with the one about the two of them going to the beach with no brakes on the car, her mother saying as they backed out of the driveway, Well, it’s downhill to the water and then we’ll see, and so they had. How they got home again she can’t recall. They never told her father or brother about going to the beach. They tucked it away like a garland at the back of a closet, to glance at once in a while when rearranging the stuff at the front.</p><p>It’s not as if they were harmless. To each other.</p><p>Two people so wired together can do harm even with the best intentions. Or no intentions at all.</p><p>It was a small house and, now that Dad had “gone to the home,” radiant with silence. At night, they sat in separate rooms, reading, not reading. On Sundays, they called a taxi and went to see Dad. (Neither of them drove. Dad used to drive.) Who Dad thought they were was unclear. He didn’t mind visits. The older woman brought grapes and the younger one smiled idiotically. They sat with him in the cafeteria, moving the dishes under his gaze one by one as he ate. He didn’t look up. Afterward, they bustled around his room uselessly. It was a room shared with a man who did not close his eyes, ever. The eyelids were dysfunctional. He said he was getting used to it. He said the doctors were afraid to meddle, in case his eyelids chose to close instead.</p><p>Both women wondered about talking. To each other. Why not now, while there is time? But they didn’t. The questions she asks me are all alternative questions—no matter what I answer, I’m always half wrong, the younger one thought (that was one excuse). Stars do not meet—they would explode (was another). The situation drew this sort of dramatics from her, which she confided to a notebook and winced at years later. If conversation made itself seem necessary, their practice was to sense what the other one wanted to hear and say that. If her mother tried offhandedness (get myself some Nembutal, finish us both off), the daughter smiled tightly and<span data-page="page_2"></span> hurried on with dinner. Once in a while they had a really good laugh. The locked corridor where Dad lived was officially Our Golden Mile, in stick-on italic letters over the registration desk, but her mother called it the Last Lap, and although this was funny enough to tell other people on the phone at night, the daughter made no comment to her mother. She did not thank her. They laughed and stopped, abyss at their feet. It would be hard to describe, or, in later years, believe, how heavy was the weight of every single word in those days. To gather enough for a sentence meant finding the strength of a hero of ancient mythology, some Heracles or Theseus, who built the walls of Troy from Cyclopean stones, each one bigger than ten normal men could lift nowadays. Her mother was a fan of space travel and liked the idea of dying on Mars. They talked a bit about this, now and then, when there were rockets blowing up on the news, but it led to the dark.</p><p>What would they have seen if they’d gazed into each other’s depths? But they didn’t. Even when doing a task together, shucking corn, washing him, they looked away. Lack of astonishment lay between them, slablike, erasing something every time it appeared. To be properly (kill the father!) astonished or astonishable happens more in plays than in life.</p><p>Anyway, one Sunday they were coming back from a visit to Dad, just rounding the corner from the highway onto their own road, a grayish-brown November day. The taxi turned onto the gravel section. There were some grayish-brown grasses poking up for light from a smear of raw grayish-brown snow—she could see them in her mind years later—some thin, unbeautiful trees, a black ditch. Cracking the window let in smells of root, ash, needle, cold. It was only halfway through the afternoon, but light and life seemed to be leaking out of the day on either side. The visit had been no worse or better than other visits, but, as she sat there watching a polished Dad skull wobble atop some clothes she mostly recognized, her insides had gone bleak and dangerous. Now the taxi veered left, past the graveyard, past the old abandoned schoolhouse where Dad had once hung his small cap on a peg, past the break in the trees where you could start to see the lake. Her mother, in the front seat, was chatting with the taxi-driver (Clayton) about his arthritis, or his wife’s arthritis, or Mars. His wife had worse arthritis than he did and would develop the knack of driving with her knuckles when Clayton died suddenly, just after Christmas.</p><p>In the back seat, she stared out the window, trying not to listen to the front seat, keeping her thought on stray things—supper, numbers, Christmas, an art work she heard about once, called something like “Horses Endlessly Running.” Had she dreamed this? No. Imagined it? Maybe. Was it in Mexico? Yes, it was Mexico! A miniature chessboard, and all the pieces were knights. And Mexico came to her like an alteration of death to day, just the word, just the thought, the little hooves drumming their way across the two-inch board, the small hearts storming in the small hot breasts, the tiny forelocks and fetlocks and withers bright with the dew of a small-scale Mexican dawn. Life ran back into her from all directions, like a color, and she leaned her forehead against the icy window, suddenly imagining telling her mother about this at supper. It was a thing outside them, gallant and bellicose and clear—she wouldn’t use fancy words like that, but some words, other words, would show up. It was worth a try. Don’t come back the way you went, Dad used to say when they went for a Sunday drive. Come a new way.</p><p>My mother-in-law is four feet nine. Embracing her, I feel big, bestial, slightly disloyal; my own mother, now deceased, was also small. Otherwise they are not alike, except for an opinion that I dress badly and am emotionally obscure, which they would have shared. That I ought to be taken somewhere to “shop for clothes” is a hovering threat. Tonight my mother-in-law and I are doing the dishes. It is Christmas night. We are in Ohio. Her name is Verna. She washes, I dry. The dishtowel, my last year’s Christmas gift to her, is printed with cartoon cameos of Bloomsbury celebrities. Verna is telling stories about Mildred, her best friend, who died. Mildred taught me everything I know, she says. Mildred taught me how to entertain. I am half-listening, thinking back to drying dishes for my own mother. I recall silence, distemper, and impotence on my part. I really wanted to talk to her, or hear her talk to me. All the same, I stood beside her at the sink night after night, year after year, in a blaze of shame lest she ask me an inside question or blurt out some entrail of her own. Fear of entrails governed us. We both had neurotic bowels. And a kind of continuing unfounded rage. So when I say “wanted to talk” it’s not quite true. I never wanted it at the time. I wanted it before, I wanted it after, I want it now, I never wanted<span data-page="page_final"></span> it at the time. At the time was always the wrong time, and I was in a rage. Are other families like this? I know I’m setting the bar high, but I cannot imagine it was ever the wrong time to talk in, say, Bloomsbury. But then here is Virginia Woolf (from “A Sketch of the Past”):</p><p>We are sealed vessels aﬂoat upon what it is convenient to call reality; at some moments, without a reason, without an eﬀort, the sealing matter cracks; in ﬂoods reality. . . .</p><p>Was it Virginia Woolf who taught us to adore these floods of reality, without which we merely navigate a sea of convenience with other people? But here it is Christmas night in Ohio and a crack is beginning to show. I stand by my mother-in-law with a soggy dishtowel in hand, pondering the holiness of conversation. She is talking about her last glimpse of Mildred. A hospital room. Mildred, laid low by one of those cancers which kill you in a weekend, can no longer eat, is sucking on a piece of ice, has a tube up her nose, and when Verna leans over the bed to ask if there’s anything she can do, Mildred shoots her a look, moves the tube aside, and says, Verna, I’d give the world right now for one of your Martinis. The next day, Mildred is dead. My dishtowel by now a saturated oblong, I fold it in three, hoping for a new dry corner. So when did Mildred pass away? I ask, and Verna says, 1965. What is a mortal being? A wind, a dream, a shadow, the ancient Greek poets tell us, but I don’t say this to Verna. I merely repeat, 1965!, in disbelief.</p><p>From the other room comes the sound of TV. It’s a Christmas special about war—they’re interviewing a soldier from some Army, I think Israeli, whose assignment is to show up at sites where a woman or a child has been killed and plant weapons on the body. I wring out my towel. Everything I want from a mother is entrail-exhausting, rage-flooded, shocked-alive, and structured like a shriek. All I have the courage to ask of her is this convenience. We wipe down the counter. We hang up towel and sponge. When I was little I understood the world to be made of paper, and that everyone should step carefully or go through the paper. I wanted a notation for that, for the going-through. I thought, I still think, this notation is stored somewhere, above us in a sort of mist or secret layer. I never realized Verna had been carrying the ghost of Mildred at the front of her mind for fifty years, like impossible antlers. The judgments we bring to bear on one another are not very sound, are they? Now Verna is scrubbing at spots on the stove with the hem of her apron. Come on, let’s watch TV, I say. I brought a movie. It’s Lubitsch—you’ll like it. ♦</p>	Anne Carson	October 31, 2016 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/31/back-the-way-you-went	Aging	Books	Conversations	Daughters	Death	Dementia	Unnamed	First, Second	Death
Bad Dreams	<p>A <span data-page="page_1"></span>child woke up in the dark. She seemed to swim up into consciousness as if to a surface, which she then broke through, looking around with her eyes open. At first, the darkness was implacable. She might have arrived anywhere: all that was certain was her own self, lying on her side, her salty smell and her warmth, her knees pulled up to her skinny chest inside the cocoon of her brushed-nylon nightdress. But as she stared into the darkness familiar forms began to loom through it: the pale outline of a window, printed by the street lamp against the curtains; the horizontals on the opposite wall, which were the shelves where she and her brother kept their books and toys. Beside the window she could make out a rectangle of wool cloth tacked up; her mother had appliquéd onto it a sleigh and two horses and a driver cracking his whip, first gluing on the pieces and then outlining them with machine stitching—star shapes in blue thread for the falling snowflakes, lines of red stitching for the reins and the twisting whip. The child knew all these details by heart, though she couldn’t see them in the dark. She was where she always was when she woke up: in her own bedroom, in the top bunk, her younger brother asleep in the lower one.</p><p>Her mother and father were in bed and asleep, too. The basement flat was small enough that, if they were awake, she would have heard the sewing machine or the wireless, or her father practicing the trumpet or playing jazz records. She struggled to sit up out of the tightly wound nest of sheets and blankets; she was asthmatic and feared not being able to catch her breath. Cold night air struck her shoulders. It was strange to stare into the room with wide-open eyes and feel the darkness yielding only the smallest bit, as if it were pressing back against her efforts to penetrate it. Something had happened, she was sure, while she was asleep. She didn’t know what it was at first, but the strong dread it had left behind didn’t subside with the confusion of waking. Then she remembered that this thing had happened inside her sleep, in her dream. She had dreamed something horrible, and so plausible that it was vividly present as soon as she remembered it.</p><p>She had dreamed that she was reading her favorite book, the one she read over and over and actually had been reading earlier that night, until her mother came to turn off the light. In fact, she could feel the book’s hard corner pressing into her leg now through the blankets. In the dream, she had been turning its pages as usual when, beyond the story’s familiar last words, she discovered an extra section that she had never seen before, a short paragraph set on a page by itself, headed “Epilogue.” She was an advanced reader for nine and knew about prologues and epilogues—though it didn’t occur to her then that she was the author of her own dreams and must have invented this epilogue herself. It seemed so completely a found thing, alien and unanticipated, coming from outside herself, against her will.</p><p>In the real book she loved, “Swallows and Amazons,” six children spent their summers in perfect freedom, sailing dinghies on a lake, absorbed in adventures and rivalries that were half invented games and half truth, pushing across the threshold of safety into a thrilling unknown. All the details in the book had the solidity of life, though it wasn’t her own life—she didn’t have servants or boats or a lake or an absent father in the Navy. She had read all the other books in the series, too, and she acted out their stories with her friends at school, although they lived in a city and none of them had ever been sailing. The world of “Swallows and Amazons” existed in a dimension parallel to their own, touching it only in their games. They had a “Swallows and Amazons” club, and took turns bringing in “grub” to eat, “grog” and “pemmican”; they sewed badges, and wrote notes in secret code. All of them wanted to be Nancy Blackett, the strutting pirate girl, though they would settle for Titty Walker, sensitive and watchful.</p><p>Now the child seemed to see the impersonal print of the dream epilogue, written on the darkness in front of her eyes. <em>John and Roger both went on to,</em> it began, in a businesslike voice. Of course, the words weren’t actually in front of her eyes, and parts of what was written were elusive when she sought them; certain sentences, though, were scored into her awareness as sharply as if she’d heard them read aloud. <em>Roger drowned at sea in his twenties.</em> Roger was the youngest of them all, the ship’s boy, in whom she had only ever been mildly interested: this threw him into a terrible new prominence. <em>John suffered with a bad heart. The Blackett sisters . . . long illnesses. Titty, killed in an unfortunate accident.</em> The litany of deaths tore jaggedly into the tissue that the book had woven, making everything lopsided and hideous. The epilogue’s gloating bland language, complacently regretful, seemed to relish catching her out in her dismay. Oh, didn’t you know? <em>Susan lived to a ripe old age</em>. Susan<span data-page="page_2"></span> was the dullest of the Swallows, tame and sensible, in charge of cooking and housekeeping. Still, the idea of her “ripe old age” was full of horror: wasn’t she just a girl, with everything ahead of her?</p><p>The child knew that the epilogue existed only in her dream, but she couldn’t dispel the taint of it, clinging to her thoughts. When she was younger, she had called to her mother if she woke in the night, but something stopped her from calling out now: she didn’t want to tell anyone about her dream. Once the words were said aloud, she would never be rid of them; it was better to keep them hidden. And she was afraid, anyway, that her mother wouldn’t understand the awfulness of the dream if she tried to explain it: she might laugh or think it was silly. For the first time, the child felt as if she were alone in her own home—its rooms spread out about her, invisible in the night, seemed unlike their usual selves. The book touching her leg through the blankets frightened her, and she thought she might never be able to open it again. Not wanting to lie down in the place where she’d had the dream, she swung over the side rail of the bed and reached with her bare feet for the steps of the ladder—the lower bunk was a cave so dark that she couldn’t make out the shape of her sleeping brother. Then she felt the carpet’s gritty wool under her toes.</p><p>The children’s bedroom, the bathroom, papered in big blue roses, and their parents’ room were all at the front of the massive Victorian house, which was four stories tall, including this basement flat; sometimes the child was aware of the other flats above theirs, full of the furniture of other lives, pressing down on their heads. Quietly she opened her bedroom door. The doors to the kitchen and the lounge, which were at the back of the flat, stood open onto the windowless hallway; a thin blue light, falling through them, lay in rectangles on the hall carpet. She had read about moonlight, but had never taken in its reality before: it made the lampshade of Spanish wrought iron, which had always hung from a chain in the hallway, seem suddenly as barbaric as a cage or a portcullis in a castle.</p><p>Everything was tidy in the kitchen: the dishcloth had been wrung out and hung on the edge of the plastic washing-up bowl; something on a plate was wrapped in greaseproof paper; the sewing machine was put away under its cover at one end of the table. The pieces of Liberty lawn print, which her mother was cutting out for one of her ladies, were folded carefully in their paper bag to keep them clean. <em>Liberty lawn:</em> her mother named it reverently, like an incantation—though the daily business of her sewing wasn’t reverent but briskly pragmatic, cutting and pinning and snipping at seams with pinking shears, running the machine with her head bent close to the work in bursts of concentration, one hand always raised to the wheel to slow it, or breaking threads quickly in the little clip behind the needle. The chatter of the sewing machine, racing and easing and halting and starting up again, was like a busy engine driving their days. There were always threads and pins scattered on the floor around where her mother was working—you had to be careful where you stepped.</p><p>In the lounge, the child paddled her toes in the hair of the white goatskin rug. Gleaming, uncanny, half reverted to its animal past, the rug yearned to the moon, which was balanced on top of the wall at the back of the paved yard. The silver frame of her parents’ wedding photograph and the yellow brass of her father’s trumpet—in its case with the lid open, beside the music stand—shone with the same pale light. Lifting the heavy lid of the gramophone, she breathed in the forbidden smell of the records nestled in their felt-lined compartments, then touched the pages heaped on her father’s desk: his meaning, densely tangled in his black italic writing, seemed more accessible through her fingertips in the dark than it ever was in daylight, when its difficulty thwarted her. He was studying for his degree in the evenings, after teaching at school all day. She and her brother played quietly so as not to disturb him; their mother had impressed upon them the importance of his work. He was writing about a book, “Leviathan”: his ink bottle had left imprints on the desk’s leather inlay, and he stored his notes on a shelf in cardboard folders, carefully labelled—the pile of folders growing ever higher. The child was struck by the melancholy of this accumulation: sometimes she felt a pang of fear for her father, as if he were exposed and vulnerable—and yet when he wasn’t working he charmed her with his jokes, pretending to be poisoned when he tasted the cakes she had made, teasing her school friends until they blushed. She never feared in the same way for her mother: her mother was capable; she was the whole world.</p><p>In their absence, her parents were more distinctly present to her than usual, as individuals with their own unfathomable adult preoccupations. She was aware of<span data-page="page_3"></span> their lives running backward from this moment, into a past that she could never enter. This moment, too, the one fitted around her now as inevitably and closely as a skin, would one day become the past: its details then would seem remarkable and poignant, and she would never be able to return inside them. The chairs in the lounge, formidable in the dimness, seemed drawn up as if for a spectacle, waiting more attentively than if they were filled with people: the angular recliner built of black tubular steel, with lozenges of polished wood for arms; the cone-shaped wicker basket in its round wrought-iron frame; the black-painted wooden armchair with orange cushions; and the low divan covered in striped olive-green cotton. The reality of the things in the room seemed more substantial to the child than she was herself—and she wanted in a sudden passion to break something, to disrupt this world of her home, sealed in its mysterious stillness, where her bare feet made no sound on the lino or the carpets.</p><p>On impulse, using all her strength, she pushed at the recliner from behind, tipping it over slowly until it was upside down, with its top resting on the carpet and its legs in the air, the rubber ferrules on its feet unexpectedly silly in the moonlight, like prim, tiny shoes. Then she tipped over the painted chair, so that its cushions flopped out. She pulled the wicker cone out of its frame and turned the frame over, flipped up the goatskin rug. She managed to make very little noise, just a few soft bumps and thuds; when she had finished, though, the room looked as if a hurricane had blown through it, throwing the chairs about. She was shocked by what she’d effected, but gratified, too: the after-sensation of strenuous work tingled in her legs and arms, and she was breathing fast; her whole body rejoiced in the chaos. Perhaps it would be funny when her parents saw it in the morning. At any rate, nothing—<em>nothing</em>—would ever make her tell them that she’d done it. They would never know, and that was funny, too. A private hilarity bubbled up in her, though she wouldn’t give way to it; she didn’t want to make a sound. At that very moment, as she surveyed her crazy handiwork, the moon sank below the top of the wall outside and the room darkened, all its solidity withdrawn.</p><p>The child’s mother woke up early, in the dawn. Had her little boy called out to her? He sometimes woke in the night and had strange fits of crying, during which he didn’t recognize her and screamed in her arms for his mummy. She listened, but heard nothing—yet she was as fully, promptly awake as if there had been some summons or a bell had rung. Carefully she sat up, not wanting to wake her sleeping husband, who was lying on his side, with his knees drawn up and his back to her, the bristle of his crew cut the only part of him visible above the blankets. The room was just as she had left it when she went to sleep, except that his clothes were thrown on top of hers on the chair; he had stayed up late, working on his essay. She remembered dimly that when he got into bed she had turned over, snuggling up to him, and that in her dream she had seemed to fit against the shape of him as sweetly as a nut into its shell, losing herself inside him. But now he was lost, somewhere she couldn’t follow him. Sometimes in the mornings, especially if they hadn’t made love the night before, she would wake to find herself beside this stranger, buried away from her miles deep, frowning in his sleep. His immobility then seemed a kind of comment, or a punishment, directed at her.</p><p>The gray light in the room was diffuse and hesitant. Even on sunny days, these rooms at the front of the flat weren’t bright. She had been happy in this flat at first, in the new freedom of her married life, but now she resented the neighbors always brooding overhead and was impatient to move to a place they could have all to themselves. But that would have to wait until he finished his degree. She eased out from under the warmth of the blankets. Now that she was thoroughly awake she needed to pee before she tried to sleep again. As she got out of bed, her reflection stood up indefatigably to meet her in the gilt-framed mirror that was one of her junk-shop finds, mounted in an alcove beside the window, with a trailing philodendron trained around it. The phantom in the baby-doll nightdress was enough like Monica Vitti (everyone said she looked like Monica Vitti) to make her straighten her back in self-respect; and she was aware of yesterday’s L’Air du Temps in the sleepy heat of her skin.</p><p>In the hall, she listened at the door of the children’s room, which stood ajar—nothing. The lavatory was chilly: its tiny high window made it feel like a prison cell, but a blackbird sang liquidly outside in the yard. On the way back to bed, she looked into the kitchen, where everything was as she’d left it—he hadn’t even made his cocoa or eaten the sandwich<span data-page="page_4"></span> she’d put out for him, before he came to bed. His refraining made her tense her jaw, as if he had repudiated her and preferred his work. She should have been a painter, she thought in a flash of anger, not a housewife and a dressmaker. But at art college she’d been overawed by the fine-arts students, who were mostly experienced grown men, newly returned from doing their national service in India and Malaya. Still, her orderly kitchen reassured her: the scene of her daily activity, poised and quiescent now, awaiting the morning, when she’d pick it up again with renewed energy. Perhaps he’d like bacon for his breakfast—she had saved up her housekeeping to buy him some. His mother had cooked bacon for him every morning.</p><p>When she glanced into the lounge, her shock at the sight of the chairs thrown about was as extreme as a hand clapped over her mouth from behind. The violence was worse because it was frozen in silence—had lain in wait, gloating, while she suspected nothing. Someone had broken in. She was too afraid in the first moments to call out to her husband. She waited in the doorway, holding her breath, for the movement that would give the intruder away; it was awful to think that a few minutes ago she had gone unprotected all the way down the lonely passageway to the lavatory. Then, as her panic subsided, she took in the odd specificity of the chaos. Only the chairs were overturned, at the center of the room; nothing else had been touched, nothing pulled off the shelves and thrown on the floor, nothing smashed. The lounge windows were tightly closed—just as the back door had surely been closed in the kitchen. Nothing had been taken. Had it? The wireless was intact on its shelf. Rousing out of her stupor, she crossed to the desk and opened the drawer where her husband kept his band earnings. The money was safe: three pound ten in notes and some loose change, along with his pipe and pipe cleaners and dirty tobacco pouch, the smell of which stayed on her fingers when she closed the drawer.</p><p>Instead of waking her husband, she tried the window catches, then went around checking the other rooms of the flat. The kitchen door and the front door were both securely bolted, and no one could have climbed in through the tiny window in the lavatory. Soundless on her bare feet, she entered the children’s bedroom and stood listening to their breathing. Her little boy stirred in his sleep but didn’t cry; her daughter was spread-eagled awkwardly amid the menagerie of her stuffed toys and dolls. Their window, too, was fastened shut. There was no intruder in the flat, and only one explanation for the crazy scene in the front room: her imagination danced with affront and dismay. Chilled, she returned to stand staring in the lounge. Her husband was moody, and she’d always known that he had anger buried in him. But he’d never done anything like this before—nothing so naked and outrageous. She supposed he must have got frustrated with his studies before he came to bed. Or was the disorder a derisory message meant for her, because he despised her homemaking, her domestication of the free life he’d once had? Perhaps the mess was even supposed to be some kind of brutal joke. She couldn’t imagine how she had slept through the outburst.</p><p>This time, for once, she was clearly in the right, wasn’t she? He had been childish, giving way to his frustration—as if she didn’t feel fed up sometimes. And he criticized her for her bad temper! He had such high standards for everyone else! From now on, she would hold on to this new insight into him, no matter how reasonable he seemed. Her disdain hurt her, like a bruise to the chest; she was more used to admiring him. But it was also exhilarating: she seemed to see the future with great clarity, looking forward through a long tunnel of antagonism, in which her husband was her enemy. This awful truth appeared to be something she had always known, though in the past it had been clouded in uncertainty and now she saw it starkly. Calmly and quietly she picked up each chair, put back the cushions, which had tumbled onto the carpet, straightened the goatskin rug. The room looked as serene as if nothing had ever happened in it. The joke of its serenity erupted inside her like bubbles of soundless laughter. Nothing—<em>nothing</em>—would ever make her acknowledge what he’d done, or the message he’d left for her, although when he saw the room restored to its rightful order, he would know that she knew. She would wait for him to be the first to acknowledge in words the passage of this silent violence between them.</p><p>In the bedroom, she lay down beside her husband with her back turned; her awareness of her situation seemed pure and brilliant, and she expected to lie awake, burning at his nearness. There was less than an hour to wait before she had to get up again; she’d got back into bed only because her feet were cold and it was too early to switch on the electric fire in the kitchen. But almost at once she dropped into a deep sleep—particularly blissful, as if she<span data-page="page_final"></span> were falling down through syrupy darkness, her limbs unbound and bathing in warmth. When she woke again—this time her little boy really was calling out to her—she remembered immediately what had happened in the night, but she also felt refreshed and blessed.</p><p>A young wife fried bacon for her husband: the smell of it filled the flat. Her son was eating cereal at the table. Her husband was preoccupied, packing exercise books into his worn briefcase, opening the drawer in his desk where he kept his pipe and tobacco, dropping these into the pocket of his tweed jacket. But he came at some point to stand behind his wife at the stove and put his arms around her, nuzzling her neck, kissing her behind her ear, and she leaned back into his kiss, as she always did, tilting her head to give herself to him.</p><p>When the bacon was ready, she served it up on a plate with fried bread and a tomato and poured his tea, then went to find out why their daughter was dawdling in the bedroom. The girl was sitting on the edge of her brother’s bunk, trying to pull on her knee-length socks with one hand while she held a book open in front of her eyes with the other. Her thin freckled face was nothing like her mother’s. One white sock was twisted around her leg with its dirty heel sticking out at the front, and the book was surely the same one she had already read several times. The child was insistent, though, that she needed to start reading it all over again, from the beginning. Her mother took the book away and chivvied her along. ♦</p>	Tessa Hadley	September 23, 2013 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/09/23/bad-dreams-3	Bedrooms	Books	Chairs	Children	Darkness	Death	Unnamed	Third	Death
Chicxulub	<p>My <span data-page="page_1"></span>daughter is walking along the roadside late at night—too late, really, for a seventeen-year-old to be out alone, even in a town as safe as this—and it is raining, the first rain of the season, the streets slick with a fine immiscible glaze of water and petrochemicals, so that even a driver in full possession of her faculties, a driver who hadn’t consumed two apple Martinis and three glasses of Hitching Post pinot noir before she got behind the wheel of her car, would have trouble keeping the thing out of the gutters and the shrubbery, off the sidewalk and <em>the highway median,</em> for Christ’s sake. . . . But that’s not really what I want to talk about, or not yet, anyway.</p><p>Have you heard of Tunguska? In Russia?</p><p>This was the site of the last known large-body impact on the Earth’s surface, nearly a hundred years ago. Or that’s not strictly accurate—the meteor, which was an estimated sixty yards across, never actually touched down. The force of its entry—the compression and superheating of the air beneath it—caused it to explode some twenty-five thousand feet above the ground, but then the term “explode” hardly does justice to the event. There was a detonation—a flash, a thunderclap—with the combustive power of eight hundred Hiroshima bombs. Thirty miles away, reindeer in their loping herds were struck dead by the blast wave, and the clothes of a hunter another thirty miles beyond that burst into flame even as he was poleaxed to the ground. Seven hundred square miles of Siberian forest were levelled in an instant. If the meteor had struck just five hours later, it would have exploded over St. Petersburg and annihilated every living thing in that glorious, baroque city. And this was only a rock. And it was only sixty yards across.</p><p>My point? You’d better get down on your knees and pray to your gods, because each year this big spinning globe we ride intersects the orbits of some twenty million asteroids, at least a thousand of which are more than half a mile in diameter.</p><p>But my daughter. She’s out there in the dark and the rain, walking home. Maureen and I bought her a car, a Honda Civic, the safest thing on four wheels, but the car was used—pre-owned, in dealerspeak—and as it happens it’s in the shop with transmission problems and, because she just had to see her friends and gossip and giggle and balance slick multicolored clumps of raw fish and pickled ginger on conjoined chopsticks at the mall, Kimberly picked her up and Kimberly will bring her home. Maddy has a cell phone and theoretically she could have called us, but she didn’t—or that’s how it appears. And so she’s walking. In the rain. And Alice K. Petermann, of 16 Briar Lane, white, divorced, a Realtor with Hyperion, who has picked at a salad and left her glasses on the bar, loses control of her vehicle.</p><p>It is just past midnight. I am in bed with a book, naked, and hardly able to focus on the clustered words and rigid descending paragraphs, because Maureen is in the bathroom slipping into the sheer black negligee I bought her at Victoria’s Secret for her birthday, and her every sound—the creak of the medicine cabinet on its hinges, the tap running, the susurrus of the brush at her teeth—electrifies me. I’ve lit a candle and am waiting for Maureen to step into the room so that I can flick off the light. We had cocktails earlier, and a bottle of wine with dinner, and we sat close on the couch and shared a joint in front of the fire, because our daughter was out and we could do that with no one the wiser. I listen to the little sounds from the bathroom, seductive sounds, maddening. I am ready. More than ready. “Hey,” I call, pitching my voice low, “are you coming or not? You don’t expect me to wait all night, do you?”</p><p>Her face appears in the doorway, the pale lobes of her breasts and the dark nipples visible through the clinging black silk. “Oh, are you waiting for me?” she says, making a game of it. She hovers at the door, and I can see the smile creep across her lips, the pleasure of the moment, drawing it out. “Because I thought I might go down and work in the garden for a while—it won’t take long, a couple hours, maybe. You know, spread a little manure, bank up some of the mulch on the roses. You’ll wait for me, won’t you?”</p><p>Then the phone rings.</p><p>We stare blankly at each other through the first two rings and then Maureen says, “I’d better get it,” and I say, “No, no, forget it—it’s nothing. It’s nobody.”</p><p>But she’s already moving.</p><p>“Forget it!” I shout, and her voice drifts back to me—“What if it’s Maddy?”—then I watch her put her lips to the receiver and whisper, “Hello?”</p><p>The night of the Tunguska explosion the skies were unnaturally bright across Europe—as far away as London people strolled in the parks past midnight and read novels out of doors while the sheep kept right on grazing and the birds stirred uneasily in the trees. There were no stars visible, no moon—just a pale, quivering light, as if all the color had been bleached out<span data-page="page_2"></span> of the sky. But, of course, that midnight glow and the fate of those unhappy Siberian reindeer were nothing at all compared to what would have happened if a larger object had invaded the Earth’s atmosphere. On average, objects greater than a hundred yards in diameter strike the planet once every five thousand years, and asteroids half a mile across thunder down at intervals of three hundred thousand years. Three hundred thousand years is a long time in anybody’s book. But if—when—such a collision occurs, the explosion will be in the million-megaton range and will cloak the atmosphere in dust, thrusting the entire planet into a deep freeze and effectively stifling all plant growth for a period of a year or more. There will be no crops. No forage. No sun.</p><p>There has been an accident, that is what the voice on the other end of the line is telling my wife, and the victim is Madeline Biehn, of 1337 Laurel Drive, according to the I.D. the paramedics found in her purse. (The purse, with a silver clasp that has been driven half an inch into the flesh under her arm by the force of the impact, is a little thing, no bigger than a hardcover book, with a ribbon-thin strap, the same purse all the girls carry, as if it were part of a uniform.) Is this her parent or guardian speaking?</p><p>I hear my wife say, “This is her mother.” And then, the bottom dropping out of her voice, “Is she—?”</p><p><em>Is she</em>? __They don’t answer such questions, don’t volunteer information, not over the phone. The next ten seconds are thunderous, cataclysmic, my wife standing there numbly with the phone in her hand as if it were some unidentifiable object she’d found in the street while I fumble out of bed to search for my pants—and my shoes, where are my shoes? The car keys? My wallet? This is the true panic, the loss of faith and control, the punch to the heart, and the struggle for breath. I say the only thing I can think to say, just to hear my own voice, just to get things straight: “She was in an accident. Is that what they said?”</p><p>“She was hit by a car. She’s—they don’t know. In surgery.”</p><p>“What hospital? Did they say what hospital?”</p><p>My wife is in motion now, too, the negligee ridiculous, unequal to the task, and she jerks it over her head and flings it to the floor even as she snatches up a blouse, shorts, flip-flops—anything, anything to cover her nakedness and get her out the door. The dog is whining in the kitchen. There is the sound of rain on the roof, intensifying, hammering at the gutters. I don’t bother with shoes—there are no shoes, shoes do not exist—and my shirt hangs limply from my shoulders, misbuttoned, sagging, tails hanging loose, and we’re in the car now and the driver’s-side wiper is beating out of synch and the night closing on us like a fist.</p><p>And then there’s Chicxulub. Sixty-five million years ago, an asteroid (or perhaps a comet—no one is quite certain) collided with the Earth on what is now the Yucatán Peninsula. Judging from the impact crater, which is a hundred and twenty miles wide, the object—this big flaming ball—was some six miles across. When it came down, day became night and that night extended so far into the future that at least seventy-five per cent of all known species were extinguished, including the dinosaurs in nearly all their forms and array and some ninety per cent of the oceans’ plankton, which in turn devastated the pelagic food chain. How fast was it travelling? The nearest estimates put it at fifty-four thousand miles an hour, more than sixty times the speed of a bullet. Astrophysicists call such objects “civilization enders,” and calculate the chances that a disaster of this magnitude will occur during any individual’s lifetime at roughly one in ten thousand, the same odds as dying in an auto accident in the next six months—or, more tellingly, living to be a hundred in the company of your spouse.</p><p>All I see is windows, an endless grid of lit windows climbing one above the other into the night, as the car shoots into the Emergency Vehicles Only <em><em>lane and slides in hard against the curb. Both doors fling open simultaneously. Maureen is already out on the sidewalk, already slamming the door behind her and breaking into a trot, and I’m right on her heels, the keys still in the ignition and the lights stabbing at the pale underbelly of a diagonally parked ambulance—and they can have the car, anybody can have it and keep it forever, if they’ll just tell me that my daughter is all right. “Just tell me</em>,”</em> I __mutter, out of breath, “just tell me and it’s yours,<em>”</em> and this is a prayer, the first in a long discontinuous string, addressed to whoever or whatever may be listening. Overhead, the sky is having a seizure, black above, quicksilver below, the rain coming down in windblown arcs, and I wouldn’t even notice but for the fact that we are suddenly—instantly—wet, our hair knotted and clinging and our clothes stuck like flypaper to the slick tegument of our skin.</p><p>In we come, side by side, through the doors that jolt back from us in<span data-page="page_3"></span> alarm, and all I can think is that the hospital is a death factory and that we have come to it like the walking dead, haggard, sallow, shoeless. “My daughter,” I say to the nurse at the admittance desk, “she’s—they called. You called. She’s been in an accident.”</p><p>Maureen is at my side, tugging at the fingers of one hand as if she were trying to remove an invisible glove. “A car. A car accident.”</p><p>“Name?” the nurse asks. About this nurse: she’s young, Filipina, with opaque eyes and the bone structure of a cadaver; every day she sees death and it blinds her. She doesn’t see us. She sees a computer screen; she sees the TV monitor mounted in the corner and the shadows that pass there; she sees the walls, the floor, the naked light of the fluorescent tube. But not us. Not us.</p><p>For one resounding moment that thumps in my ears and then thumps again, I can’t remember my daughter’s name—I can picture her leaning into the mound of textbooks spread out on the dining-room table, the glow of the overhead light making a nimbus of her hair as she glances up at me with a glum look and half a rueful smile, as if to say, <em>It’s all in a day</em>’<em>s work for a teen-ager, Dad, and you</em>’<em>re lucky you</em>’<em>re not in high school anymore,</em> but her name is gone.</p><p>“Maddy,” my wife says. “Madeline Biehn.”</p><p>I watch, mesmerized, as the nurse’s fleshless fingers maneuver the mouse, her eyes locked on the screen before her. A click. Another click. The eyes lift to take us in, even as they dodge away again. “She’s still in surgery,” she says.</p><p>“Where is it?” I demand. “What room? Where do we go?”</p><p>Maureen’s voice cuts in then, elemental, chilling, and it’s not a question she’s posing, not a statement or demand, but a plea: “What’s wrong with her?”</p><p>Another click, but this one is just for show, and the eyes never move from the screen. “There was an accident,” the nurse says. “She was brought in by the paramedics. That’s all I can tell you.”</p><p>It is then that I become aware that we are not alone, that there are others milling around the room—other zombies like us, hurriedly dressed and streaming water till the beige carpet is black with it—and why, I wonder, do I despise this nurse more than any human being I’ve ever encountered, this young woman not much older than my daughter, with her hair pulled back in a bun and a white cap like a party favor perched atop it, <em>who is just doing her job</em>? Why do I want to reach across the counter that separates us and awaken her to a swift, sure knowledge of hate and fear and pain? Why?</p><p>“Ted,” Maureen says, and I feel her grip at my elbow, and then we’re moving again—hurrying, sweeping, practically running—out of this place, down a corridor under the glare of the lights that are a kind of death in themselves, and into a worse place, a far worse place.</p><p>The thing that disturbs me about Chicxulub, aside from the fact that it erased the dinosaurs and wrought catastrophic and irreversible change, is the deeper implication that we, and all our works and worries and attachments, are so utterly inconsequential. Death cancels our individuality, we know that, yes, but ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny, and the kind goes on, human life and culture succeed us. That, in the absence of God, is what allows us to accept the death of the individual. But when you throw Chicxulub into the mix—or the next Chicxulub, the Chicxulub that could come howling down to obliterate all and everything even as your eyes skim the lines of this page—where does that leave us?</p><p>"You’re the parents?” We are in another room, gone deeper now, the loudspeakers murmuring their eternal incantations—_Dr. Chandrasoma to Emergency, Dr. Bell, Paging Dr. Bell—_and here is another nurse, grimmer, older, with lines like the strings of a tobacco pouch pulled tight around her lips. She’s addressing us, me and my wife, but I have nothing to say, either in denial or affirmation. If I claim Maddy as my own—and I’m making deals again—then I’m sure to jinx her, because those powers that might or might not be, those gods of the infinite and the minute, will see how desperately I love her and they’ll take her away just to spite me for refusing to believe in them. <em>Voodoo, Hoodoo, Santería, Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.</em> I __hear Maureen’s voice, emerging from a locked vault, the single whispered monosyllable, and then: “Is she going to be all right?”</p><p>“I don’t have that information,” the nurse says, and her voice is neutral, robotic even. This is not her daughter. Her daughter’s at home, asleep in a pile of Teddy bears, pink sheets, fluffy pillows, the night-light glowing like the all-seeing eye of a sentinel.</p><p>I can’t help myself. It’s that neutrality, that maddening clinical neutrality, and can’t anybody take any responsibility for anything? “What information <em>do</em> you have?” I say, and maybe I’m too loud, maybe I am. “Isn’t that your job, for Christ’s sake—to know what’s going on here? You call us up in the middle of the night—our daughter’s hurt, she’s been in an accident, and you tell me you<span data-page="page_4"></span> don’t have <em>any fucking information</em>?”</p><p>People turn their heads, eyes burn into us. They’re slouched in orange plastic chairs, stretched out on the floor, praying, pacing, their lips moving in silence. They want information, too. We all want information. We want news, good news: it was all a mistake, minor cuts and bruises—contusions, that’s the word—and your daughter, son, husband, grandmother, first cousin twice removed will be walking through that door over there any minute. . . .</p><p>The nurse drills me with a look, and then she’s coming out from behind the desk, a short woman, dumpy—almost a dwarf—and striding briskly to a door, which swings open on another room, deeper yet. “If you’ll just follow me, please,” she says.</p><p>Suddenly sheepish, I duck my head and comply, two steps behind Maureen. This room is smaller, an examining room, with a set of scales and charts on the walls and its slab of a table covered with a sheet of antiseptic paper. “Wait here,” the nurse tells us, already shifting her weight to make her escape. “The doctor will be in in a minute.”</p><p>“What doctor?” I want to know. “What for? What does he want?”</p><p>But the door has already drawn closed.</p><p>I turn to Maureen. She’s standing there in the middle of the room, afraid to touch anything or to sit down or even to move for fear of breaking the spell. She’s listening for footsteps, her eyes fixed on the door. I hear myself murmur her name, and then she’s in my arms, sobbing, and I know I should hold her, know that we both need it, the human contact, the love and support, but all I feel is the burden of her—there is nothing and no one that can make this better, can’t she see that? I don’t want to console or be consoled. I don’t want to be touched. I just want my daughter back.</p><p>Maureen’s voice comes from so deep in her throat I can barely make out what she’s saying. It takes a second to register, even as she pulls away from me, her face crumpled and red, and this is her prayer, whispered aloud: “She’s going to be all right, isn’t she?”</p><p>“Sure,” I say, “sure she is. She’ll be fine. She’ll have some bruises, that’s for sure, maybe a couple broken bones even . . . ” and I trail off, trying to picture it, the crutches, the cast, the Band-Aids, the gauze: our daughter returned to us in a halo of shimmering light.</p><p>“Maybe she broke her arm—she could break her arm. That would— Or her leg, even her leg. But why would she be in surgery? Why would she be in surgery so long? Why? Why would that be?”</p><p>I don’t have an answer to that. I don’t want to have an answer.</p><p>“It was a car,” Maureen says. “A car, Ted. A car hit her.”</p><p>The room seems to tick and buzz with the fading energy of the larger edifice, and I can’t help thinking of the congeries of wires strung inside the walls, the cables bringing power to the X-ray lab, the EKG and EEG machines, the life-support systems, and of the myriad pipes and the fluids that they drain.</p><p>A car. Three thousand pounds of steel, chrome, glass, iron.</p><p>“What was she even doing walking like that? She knows better than that.”</p><p>My wife nods, the wet ropes of her hair beating at her shoulders like the flails of the penitents. “She probably had a fight with Kimberly—I’ll bet that’s it. I’ll bet anything.”</p><p>“Where is the son of a bitch?” I snarl. “This doctor—where is he?”</p><p>We are in that room, in that purgatory of a room, for a good hour or more. Twice I thrust my head out the door to give the nurse an annihilating look, but there is no news, no doctor, nothing. And then, at quarter past two, the inner door swings open, and there he is, a man too young to be a doctor, an infant with a smooth bland face and hair that rides a wave up off his brow, and he doesn’t have to say a thing, not a word, because I can see what he’s bringing us and my heart seizes with the shock of it. He looks to Maureen, looks to me, then drops his eyes. “I’m sorry,” he says.</p><p>When it comes, the meteor will punch through the atmosphere and strike the Earth in the space of a single second, vaporizing on impact and creating a fireball that will in that moment achieve temperatures of sixty thousand degrees Kelvin, or ten times the surface reading of the sun. If it is Chicxulub-size and it hits one of our landmasses, some two hundred thousand cubic kilometres of the Earth’s surface will be thrust up into the atmosphere, even as the thermal radiation of the blast sets fire to the Earth’s cities and forests. This will be succeeded by seismic and volcanic activity on a scale unknown in human history, and then the dark night of cosmic winter. If it should land in the sea, as the Chicxulub meteor did, it would spew superheated water into the atmosphere, instead, extinguishing the light of the sun and triggering the same scenario of seismic catastrophe and eternal winter, while simultaneously sending out a rippling ring of water<span data-page="page_final"></span> three miles high to rock the continents as if they were saucers in a dishpan.</p><p>So what does it matter? What does anything matter? We are powerless. We are bereft. And the gods—all the gods of all the ages combined—are nothing but a rumor.</p><p>The gurney is the focal point in a room of gurneys, people laid out as if there’d been a war, the beaked noses of the victims poking up out of the maze of sheets like a series of topographic blips on a glaciated plain. These people are alive still, fluids dripping into their veins, machines monitoring their vital signs, nurses hovering over them like ghouls, but they’ll be dead soon, all of them. That much is clear. But <em>the</em> gurney, the one against the back wall with the sheet pulled up over the impossibly small and reduced form—this is all that matters. The doctor leads us across the room, speaking in a low voice of internal injuries, a ruptured spleen, trauma, the brain stem, and I can barely control my feet.</p><p>Can I tell you how hard it is to lift this sheet? Thin percale, and it might as well be made of lead, iron, iridium, might as well be the repository of all the dark matter in the universe. The doctor steps back, hands folded before him. The entire room or triage ward or whatever it is holds its breath. Maureen moves in beside me till our shoulders are touching, till I can feel the flesh and the heat of her pressing into me, and I think of this child we made together, this thing under the sheet, and the hand clenches at the end of my arm, the fingers there, prehensile, taking hold. The sheet draws back millimetre by millimetre, the slow striptease of death—and I can’t do this, I can’t—until Maureen lunges forward and jerks the thing off in a single violent motion.</p><p>It takes us a moment—the shock of the bloated and discolored flesh, the crusted mat of blood at the temple and the rag of the hair, this obscene violation of everything we know and expect and love—before the surge of joy hits us. Maddy is a redhead, like her mother, and though she’s seventeen, she’s as rangy and thin as a child, with oversized hands and feet, and she never did pierce that smooth sweet run of flesh beneath her lower lip. I can’t speak. I’m rushing still with the euphoria of this new mainline drug I’ve discovered, soaring over the room, the hospital, the whole planet. Maureen says it for me: “This is not our daughter.”</p><p>Our daughter is not in the hospital. Our daughter is asleep in her room beneath the benevolent gaze of the posters on the wall—Britney and Brad and Justin—her things scattered around her as if laid out for a rummage sale. Our daughter has in fact gone to Hana Sushi at the mall, as planned, and Kimberly has driven her home. Our daughter has, unbeknownst to us or anyone else, fudged the rules a bit—the smallest thing in the world, nothing really, the sort of thing every teen-ager does without thinking twice. She has loaned her I.D. to her second-best friend, Kristi Cherwin, because Kristi is sixteen and Kristi wants to see—is dying to see—the movie at the Cineplex with Brad Pitt in it, the one rated NC-17. Our daughter doesn’t know that we’ve been to the hospital, doesn’t know about Alice K. Petermann and the pinot noir and the glasses left on the bar, doesn’t know that even now the phone is ringing at the Cherwins’.</p><p>I am sitting on the couch with a drink, staring into the ashes of the fire. Maureen is in the kitchen with a mug of Ovaltine, gazing vacantly out the window where the first streaks of light have begun to limn the trunks of the trees. I try to picture the Cherwins—they’ve been to the house a few times, Ed and Lucinda—and I draw a blank until a backlit scene from the past presents itself, a cookout at their place, the adults gathered around the grill with gin-and-tonics, the radio playing some forgotten song, the children, our daughters, riding their bikes up and down the cobbled drive, making a game of it, spinning, dodging, lifting the front wheels from the ground even as their hair fans out behind them and the sun crashes through the trees. Flip a coin ten times and it could turn up heads ten times in a row—or not once. The rock is coming, the new Chicxulub, hurtling through the dark and the cold to remake our fate. But not tonight. Not for me.</p><p>For the Cherwins, it’s already here. ♦</p>	T.

Daisy	<p>The <span data-page="page_1"></span>day that Daisy died was a lot like this one, early August, with the sun seemingly stuck right at the top of the sky, casting light and heat that made all the neighborhood kids vault over each other with glee and subdued everyone else, moms and dads and older folks and even the family pets. Daisy liked the heat, and though she didn’t know how to swim, she’d spend plenty of time in our back-yard pool, tanning in her plaid one-piece in the floating lounger or else dog-paddling with an old-fashioned life preserver looped under her arms. I tried to teach her how to swim a couple of times, but I’d end up all scratched around the neck and shoulders, Daisy lurching and pulling on me whenever I let her go, yelling if her face or scalp got wet. She wasn’t dainty or persnickety but for some reason she hated being submerged. She always showered with a cap and on alternate days shampooed her hair in the kitchen sink, the drain of which I’d have to unclog every couple of weeks, pulling out the thick black strands with a pair of chopsticks.</p><p>And I swear—I swear, I swear—that I never imagined for a second that the pool was dangerous, at least for her. Sure, I jumped in a half-dozen times to pluck out one of my kids or their mangy booger-streaked friends thrashing fitfully in the deep end, but Daisy was always careful and tentative; even after she started to change and began seeing our family doctor for meds, she entered the water as if it were as hot as soup, then pushed off from the steps with her float tube and kicked, her taut chin just above the surface.</p><p>“Hey, honey,” she’d say to me, the ends of her hair slicked to pencil points. “I’m a mermaid.”</p><p>“Sexier than that,” I’d say, through the Sunday paper, through the summer haze.</p><p>It was nice like that, a lot of the time. I remember how Theresa and Jack would spend pretty much every second between breakfast and dinner in the pool, or running about on the concrete surround and the lawn spraying each other and whatever friends were around with water pistols filled with Hi-C punch, or sometimes even pee. (I caught them once in the rickety little cabana I’d built, giggling and pissing all over their hands.) If it was the weekend, I’d be out there for a good while, too. I’d chuck the kids around in the water and play the monster or the buffoon and do a belly flop or two for a finale, then dry off and wrap a towel around my waist and drag a chaise and a beer beneath the maples and doze until one of the kids got hurt or fell or puked after drinking too much pool water, all of which in the heat and brightness and clamor made for a mighty decent time. This was dependent, of course, on what mood Daisy was in, but in those early days she was pretty solid, she was pretty much herself, she was just like the girl I fell in love with.</p><p>In the afternoon, she would set up the patio table with all kinds of vittles—she’d have soppressata and sugar ham and a crock of port-wine cheese and Ritz and Triscuits, and she’d have plenty of carrot and celery sticks and pimiento olives—and then she’d bring out an electric fryer, a long contractor’s extension cord snaking back through the kitchen window, to fry chicken wings or butterflied shrimp or French fries right there on the table, so the food was hot and fresh. If my folks or other people were going to be over, she’d put out her homemade eggrolls and some colorful seaweed-and-rice thing that we didn’t yet know, back in 1975, was sushi, and which people in our part of Long Island couldn’t believe she had made, along with spicy sweet ribs and a cold noodle dish whose Korean name she always told us but we could never remember, although everyone loved it and always finished it first. She had this way of arranging the food that made you think of formal gardens: everything was garnished with fans of sliced oranges or shrubs of kale or waterfowl she’d carved out of apples, giving them shiny red wings.</p><p>I was working a lot then, having just been made second-in-command at Battle Brothers Brick &amp; Mortar, a masonry company started by my grandfather during the Depression which my father and uncles had transformed into a successful landscaping firm, and which I have maintained with much hard work, if little passion. I never had any love for brick and mortar, or for mulch and shrubs, and in those days I was mostly waiting around for my brother Bobby to return from Vietnam and take my place, which he never did.</p><p>Daisy was like a lot of the young mothers in the neighborhood, which meant that she took care of the house and the kids and the cooking and the bills and whatever else came up that I could have dealt with but didn’t, for the usual semi-acceptable reasons of men; but Daisy didn’t mind, that was never a problem between us, because when you got right down to it she was an old-fashioned girl in matters of family, and also because her nature<span data-page="page_2"></span> (before she changed and ended up another person entirely) preferred order to everything else, and certainly didn’t want any lame hand Jerry Battle could provide.</p><p>In fact, the first real signs of her troubles were the kinds of things you see in most people’s houses—stuff like piles of folded laundry waiting to be put away, some dishes in the sink, toys loose underfoot—but for Daisy, when this began to happen, it meant there was a quiet disaster occurring, a cave-in somewhere deep in the core. One time, on a day just like this, kids frolicking about, our guests arrayed around the back yard and the spread of goodies on the patio table, Daisy suddenly unravelled. I don’t know what happened exactly but one of the kids must have bumped the table where she was using the deep fryer, and hot oil lipped over the edge and splashed onto the table and then spilled down onto her sandalled foot. I knew something had happened because I saw her jump a little and leap back, and it occurred to me only later that she didn’t shout or scream or make any sound at all. I went over to see if she was burned, but before I could get there Daisy did the oddest thing: she picked up the fryer by its handles, turned it over, and slammed it on the table, the oil and chicken wings spurting out sideways, luckily in nobody’s direction. I yanked the extension cord off and asked her if she was all right, and she had a sickened look on her face and she said that it was an accident and she was sorry. By this time our guests had crowded around. I’m sure no one saw what had really happened, since everyone was appropriately concerned, but I knew and I got angry (if only because I was confused and a little scared) and yelled at her to be more careful. She started crying and that brought an end to the afternoon, most of our guests deciding to leave, among them some neighbors, who never called us again.</p><p>Of course, somewhere not so deep down, none of what happened that afternoon was a surprise to me. From the moment I met Daisy, on the main floor of Gimbels in New York, where she was offering sample sprays of men’s cologne (I think it was Pierre Cardin, a huge phallic bottle of which I bought that day and may still have in the bottom of the bathroom vanity), I knew she was volatile. At Gimbels, Daisy sprayed me before I consented and then sprayed me again, and I would have been really annoyed except that she was amazingly bright-eyed and pretty and she had these perfect little hands, with which she smoothed down my coat collar. She’d been in the country for only a few months, attending Hunter College to study art history. She had a heavy accent to her English, but she wasn’t a tentative talker. She let her talk spill out in a messy exuberant froth, the effect instantly inundating and certainly charming and not at all unsexy. I asked her if she would take a walk with me and she left her post without a word to anyone and we ended up lunching at the H. &amp; H. automat, where I had an egg-salad sandwich and she got the Salisbury-steak meal with mashed potatoes and gravy, plus side dishes of cut corn and green beans and for dessert a slice of both German chocolate cake and cherry pie. She bolted all of it down as if she were some war refugee, but she was perfectly neat and systematic in doing so—every square of steak was larded with mashed potato, every forkful of cake or pie topped with whipped cream, the gravy finally cleaned up with white bread and the syrupy cherry filling with her index finger, the last dredge of which she offered up and let me lick. I probably thought then that she was loony, but—surprise, surprise—I didn’t care.</p><p>I had no idea what real craziness was. I thought people like my father and my little brother Bobby were off kilter and ego-active and maybe in need of professional help, but I didn’t know what it meant to be D.S.M.-certified, described in the literature, perhaps totally nuts. Just before he went to Vietnam on his first and last tour, Bobby threw Ma and Pop a surprise wedding-anniversary party—their twenty-sixth or twenty-seventh, definitely not one of the big ones—spending every last dime he had made playing a couple of summers of minor-league baseball on a fifty-guest dinner in the city at a famous French restaurant with murals on the walls. Pop was so pleased when he arrived that he told the sommelier to bring out his best wine (which he’d always do at the Chianti Corner in Islip when entertaining a Battle Brothers customer), but a couple of cases of Château Incroyable later the bill had tripled. Bobby couldn’t cover it. Luckily I was still carrying the day’s receipts, and with a few last secreted bills from Ma we avoided any embarrassment, and all the while Pop and Bobby were toasting each other’s good taste and fealty and love. For years Pop would say that Bobby should have met and married Daisy, that he would have been a better match for her than I. He<span data-page="page_3"></span> was probably right, though I’m sure that, had Bobby ever returned from the war, Pop would have steered him to a reliable domestic model, some quiet local girl who wouldn’t fire up the afterburners when she didn’t need to.</p><p>A month or so after the deep-fryer incident, the first genuine trouble revealed itself. Daisy went off to Bloomingdale’s and charged up seven thousand dollars on a leather living-room set and a full-length chinchilla coat. We had a terrific fight, me rabid with disbelief and Daisy defiant and bitter, talking about how she “knew class people” and mocking me for “working in dirt” like some peasant or field hand. Her eyes were wild and she was almost spitting with hatred.</p><p>In the previous days, she had bought herself and the kids several new outfits and served us filet mignon and lobsters and repainted our bedroom a deep Persian crimson. I didn’t know then that these actions were indicative of a grandiose run-up to a truly alarming finale; in fact, I was pretty pleased, because Daisy seemed happy for the first time in a long time. She was lively with the kids and we were making love every night. I figured I was still way ahead of a lot of other guys with young families I knew, who were already playing the field and spending most of their free time away from the house. If Daisy hadn’t blitzkrieged our net worth at Bloomingdale’s nothing much would have changed; it’s likely I wouldn’t have cared if she were only steadily depleting our bank account, a time-honored activity in our civilized world. This was 1975, though, when the economy was basically shitting itself, and Jack and Theresa were seven and six and I was making twenty thousand dollars a year at Battle Brothers, which was a hell of a lot of money, actually, and much more than I deserved. But seven thousand dollars for anything was ruinous, so I had to beg the store manager to take everything back (with a ten-per-cent restocking fee, plus delivery), and then I cut up her charge cards and took away her bankbook and started giving her the minimum cash allowance for the week’s groceries and gas.</p><p>As you can imagine, Daisy wasn’t exactly pleased with the arrangement. It was a suggestion from Pop, whom I hadn’t consulted directly but who had overheard my mother telling her sister what Daisy had done. The next day, Pop barrelled in to the messy office we shared at the shop and plunked his backside onto my desk blotter and asked me what the hell I was doing. I had no clue what he was talking about, and as usual in those days I stared up at him with my mouth half crooked, absently probing my upper molars with my tongue.</p><p>“I’m talking about Daisy,” he growled, as if he were the one who had married her, as if he were the one having trouble. I should mention that Pop had always adored Daisy. From the second he met her it was clear—he could never stop talking about how gorgeous she was and how sexy, and whenever they met he’d corral her with a big hug and a kiss and then he’d twirl her in a little cha-cha move, all of which Daisy welcomed and played into as if she were Audrey Hepburn in “Roman Holiday,” which was just the kind of humoring and ass-kissing that my father has always lived for and measured everyone by.</p><p>“I hear she went on a spree at the department store and damn near bankrupted you.”</p><p>“Not near,” I said. “It was seven grand.”</p><p>“Holy Jesus.”</p><p>“But it’s fixed now. I made it go away.”</p><p>“Damn it, Jerome, it’s just going to happen again! Don’t you know how to handle your wife yet?”</p><p>“I think I’ve learned something in these last eight years, yes.”</p><p>“Bullshit. Listen to me. Are you listening, Jerome? This is what I’m telling you. You have to squash her every once in a while—I mean, completely flatten her. Otherwise a beautiful woman like Daisy gets big ideas, and those ideas get bigger every year. If she were a plain sedan like your mother you wouldn’t have to worry, you’ve only got to deal with a certain displacement, you know what I mean? But with a sleek machine you’ve got to tool a governor onto the sucker, do something to cut her fuel.”</p><p>“I have no idea what you’re talking about, Pop.”</p><p>“What I’m saying is you’ve got to be a little brutal. Not always, just every once in a while. Now is a good time. All this women’s libbing and bra burning is confusing everybody. Treat her badly, don’t give her any money or attention or even a chance to bitch or argue. Don’t let her leave the house for a week. Then when she’s really down in the dumps bring her some diamond earrings or a tennis bracelet and take her out to a lobster dinner. After, screw her brains out, or whatever you can manage. Then everything will go back to normal, you’ll see.”</p><p>“And how do you know any of this works, if Ma isn’t that kind of woman?”</p><p>“Trust your pop, Jerome. I have wide experience. And if that doesn’t do it, call Dr. Derricone.”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah, yeah,” I must have said, to get him off my desk<span data-page="page_4"></span> and case. But that night when I got home Daisy was undertaking an overhaul of our house; she was going through a couple of hundred fabric swatches that were piled on the kitchen table, along with several china and silver patterns, and some odd squares of linoleum and porcelain floor tile; she had even begun painting the dining and living rooms with sample swaths of paint, quart cans of which sat out opened, used brushes lying across the rims. For dinner she was heating up some leftover pasta on the stove. In the den the kids were watching TV, rolling popcorn in bologna slices as a pre-dinner snack, and then spitting streams of Dr Pepper at each other through the gaps in their front teeth. When I asked Daisy what the heck was going on, she looked up and answered that she couldn’t decide between a shiny or a not-so-shiny silk for the living-room curtains and what did I think?</p><p>She was grinning, though painfully, as if part of her could see and hear the miserable scene and could understand that another part was taking over. I couldn’t holler right then as I wanted to, and instead just grumbled, “Whatever, dear,” and went to the bedroom and stripped out of my dusty work clothes and turned on the water in the shower as hot as I could bear, because there’s nothing like a good near-scald to set you right again, to take you out of a time line and set you momentarily free. And suddenly I was even feeling a little chubby down there with the hot trickles in my crack and so gave myself a couple of exploratory tugs, when Daisy opened the shower door and stepped inside, paint-splattered clothes and all.</p><p>“Jerry,” she said, crying, through the billowing steam. “Jerry, I’m sorry.”</p><p>I didn’t answer and she said it again, said my name again, with her rolling, singsong, messed-up “R”s, and I hugged her, clutching her beneath the spray.</p><p>“So hot!” she gasped, recoiling, and I let go, but she grabbed back and held me tight, tighter and tighter, until she got used to the temperature. Then she kissed me, and kissed me again, and when I kissed her back I thought I was tasting something mineral, like thinner or paint, but when we broke for air I could see the faded wash of pink on her chin, on her mouth: she’d bitten her tongue trying to stand the hot water.</p><p>I pointed the showerhead away from us and she took off her wet clothes and said, “Make love to me,” and we started to screw on the built-in bench of the shower stall, something we hadn’t done since we first bought the house, before Jack was born. I remember Daisy being five months pregnant and showing in a way I hadn’t expected would be so attractive, the smooth, sheened bulge of her belly and her popped-out belly button and the changed size and color of her nipples, long like the nipples on baby bottles and the color of dark caramels. Daisy was not voluptuous, which I liked, with her long, lean torso and shortish Asian legs (perfectly hairless) and her breasts that were shaped in the form of gently pitched dunes, these delicate pale hillocks. I realize I may be waxing pathetic here, your basic sorry white dude afflicted with what Theresa nowadays refers to as “Saigon syndrome” (“Me so hor-ny, G.I. Joe!”), but I’m not really sorry, because the fact is I found her desirable precisely because she was put together differently from what I was used to, as it were; she was totally unlike the wide-hipped Italian or leggy Irish girls or the broad-bottomed Polish chicks from Our Lady of Wherever I had been raised on since youth and who, compared with Daisy, seemed pretty dreadful contraptions.</p><p>Unfair, I know, unfair.</p><p>Though that evening in the shower, eight years into our marriage, I wasn’t so much enamored of Daisy as I was hopeful for any break in her strange mood. I thought (or so I thought later) that some good coarse sex might disturb the disturbance, shunt aside the offending system, and it might have worked had our little Theresa not opened the shower door and stood watching for God knows how long as I was engaging her mother in the doggie-style stance we tended to employ when things between us weren’t perfectly fine. Daisy must have peered around and seen Theresa standing there sucking on her thumb and shoved me off so hard I slipped and fell onto my back, providing a second sighting of me that made Theresa actually step back. I covered myself and asked her what she wanted and she couldn’t answer and then Daisy yelled at her to tell us.</p><p>Theresa said, “The macaroni is on fire, and Jack can’t put it out.”</p><p>“Take care of her!” I said to Daisy, and then grabbed a towel to wrap myself with and ran down to the kitchen, where Jack was tossing handfuls of water at the frying pan as it roared up in flames. The steam and smoke were pooling at the ceiling, and, as I pulled Jack away into the dining room, he fought me a little, trying to go back.</p><p>“Dad, it’s burning the metal,” he said, pointing to the steel hood above the stove, its painted surface blackening.<span data-page="page_5"></span></p><p>“Stay right here,” I told him, tamping down on his shoulders. “O.K.?”</p><p>I rushed in and opened the bottom drawer of the stove, where Daisy kept the pot lids, searching for one large enough to cover the big skillet. I found one and tossed it on, but it was about an inch shy all around and the flames flickered low only for a second, then leaped up again. Daisy always used a lot of butter or oil, and so I took off my bath towel and folded it and tried to smother the whole pan, the fire licking up where I wasn’t pressing hard enough, singeing my forearm and chest hairs and making me instantly consider all things from the narrow, terrified view of my fast-shrinking privates, and then Jack ran forward and tried to help by tugging down the edge of the towel. I picked him up and carried him to the living room and hurled him onto one of the as yet unreturned sofas, shouting “Stay put!” and also warning him not to soil the upholstery, if he valued his life. But by then the towel had caught fire and instinctively I did what Jack had already tried, splashing on water with my hands and then with a coffee mug, which did no good at all. So I finally took the skillet by the handle and opened the sliding door to the deck and stepped out. The firelight caught the attention of our back neighbors, the Lipschers, who were throwing a small dinner party on their patio. I’d spoken to the husband maybe once or twice, the wife three or four times; we’d invited them over a couple of times for barbecues but they’d never made it. They were into tony Manhattan-type gatherings, with candles and French wine and testy, clever conversation (you could hear every word from our deck) about Broadway plays or Israel or their favorite Caribbean islands, everyone constantly interrupting everyone else in their bid to impress one another, all in tones that said they weren’t. But the sight of me clearly got their attention. Someone at the table said “Look at that!” and with the skillet in one hand I waved with the other, the Lipschers and their guests limply waving back. For some reason it didn’t seem neighborly to chuck the frying pan, so I held it out in full flambé, Daisy now stepping out in her towel with the kids in tow, all of us waiting for the fire to die out. It took a while. When it finally did, Barry Lipscher said, “Hey there, Battle, you want to end the show now? We’re still eating here, if you don’t mind.”</p><p>To this Daisy unhooked her bath sheet and wrapped it around my waist, then turned to the Lipschers and their guests in all her foxy loveliness and gave them the finger. If I remember right, Theresa did the same, Jack and I grinning idiotically as we trailed our women into the house.</p><p>But in truth, I’m afraid, it didn’t quite end up as nicely as all that—young family Battle triumphant in solidarity, chuckling over the charred cabinetry and the toasty scent of burned pasta.</p><p>“Clean this up,” I said to Daisy, my voice nothing but a cold instrument. “We’ll talk tomorrow.”</p><p>The next day, I instituted what Pop had suggested, basically placing Daisy under house arrest for the week (no car keys, no credit cards, twenty dollars cash), and promising her that I’d never speak to her again unless she sent back all the samples and swatches and kept the house in an acceptable state and made proper meals for the kids and checked with me from that point on before she bought anything—I mean <em>anything</em>—other than staples like milk and bread or underwear or school supplies.</p><p>In those days I could threaten someone like that. I had got into the habit at Battle Brothers, hollering at the fellas all day and lecturing my subcontractors and even talking tough to my customers, if they got to be too clingy or whiny or just plain pains in the ass, which at some point in every job they all did. But maybe it wasn’t so much the habit itself as it was its effectiveness that I kept returning to—how I could reliably get all sorts of people to move it or jump or shut the hell up. People say that I’m like Pop that way, that I’ll get this expression on my face, as if whatever you’re saying or doing is this crime, and that for you not to desist would be the most contemptible of acts.</p><p>And then I’ll say what I want to have happen, what I want done, as I did that morning to Daisy. She could hardly look at me as she sat on the toilet while I shaved, her straight hair screening her face like those beaded curtains we all used to have. I repeated myself, then left for work and didn’t call home all day. I wanted to call but I held firm, even as I imagined a disaster like a flood in the basement or an electrical fire. But it was one of those times as a husband when you have to decline the counsel of sound judgment and valor and gut-piercing panics and yield instead to the matchless attraction of simply making your damn<span data-page="page_6"></span> point. To Daisy, the point was this: I’m leaving it to you, babe, and you alone.</p><p>Daisy’s sense of fearless self-reliance was partly, I suppose, why I was so taken with her to begin with. She’d come to the States by herself, just twenty years old, going to school and living not in a dormitory or in one of those single- women’s residences but in an apartment in a needle-littered Harlem tenement with some post-Marxist black-chick Ph.D. with a last name like Weiss, the cultural compaction of which really blew my mind. I couldn’t imagine what Daisy’s parents thought about any of this, and I never found out. They were seminarians, I guess, but for one reason or another she rarely talked about them, and during our years together I didn’t prod her to say much more about them or the rest of her family in Korea. She never seemed to mind. All I knew was that of four or five children she probably wasn’t the favorite, and that the only person from her family to show up for our wedding was an older brother with a pinched-up face who didn’t smile or say a word during the rehearsal dinner and hotly scolded her afterward in the parking lot, I’m sure for marrying a white guy. He was also tugging on her arm in a way that I didn’t like, and I ended up having to push him a bit too hard against his taxi to get him to release her. He cursed me and cursed Daisy and then they cursed each other for what seemed like five minutes, all this spiky language hurtling back and forth, until finally she laid into him with some choice American swear words and he relented, muffling his ears as he got into the taxi. He wasn’t at the ceremony the next day, and I don’t think Daisy even noticed.</p><p>When I got home from work, the place wasn’t on fire and there were no ambulances parked on the lawn. I rolled my pickup inside the garage and went in. The house was peerlessly clean and quiet and the kids were in the den playing and there was a tuna casserole bubbling away in the oven, four place settings sparkling on the kitchen table. The only thing missing was Daisy. I asked the kids where she was and they didn’t know. I looked out back and in the street. Then I went to our bedroom, which was empty but neat, and when I walked into the bathroom there Daisy was, still dressed in her pink robe with baby-blue piping, sitting on the edge of the toilet exactly as she had been eight hours earlier, as if she’d been cast right into the cool porcelain.</p><p>“I fixed the house,” she said, her voice husky, dried out.</p><p>“Yeah,” I said, just as I might to the guys, as though it were no more than I’d expected. It’s always best, when you’re trying to get things done, to utter the absolute minimum. You made it rain? O.K. You moved heaven and earth? Fine. Pop was the one who showed me how effective it can be to say grindingly little at the very moments when you ought to say a lot, when you could easily be generous with praise or forgiveness, when you could tender all you had and no one would ask for anything extra in return.</p><p>I know. I know about this. I do.</p><p>So when Daisy went on to say, “The other stuff, too. I got rid of it all. I did what you want, Jerry,” what did I say back but simply, “Right,” with a slight tip of the head, and a tough-guy grunt, which you’d think would be just what Daisy had had to deal with all her inscrutable Oriental life, and probably had, and was likely part of the reason she’d ended up with someone like me, some average American Guido she figured would have more than plenty to say, entreating her every second with his hands and his hips and with his heart bleeding all over.</p><p>Daisy didn’t say anything and neither did I, and for a moment our normally cramped bathroom felt very large, the only sound coming from the running toilet tank, with its wasteful ever-wash that I’ve always meant to fix but never actually have fixed, even to this day. Daisy got up then and brushed past me and I could hear her walk out of our bedroom and down the hallway to the kitchen. I showered and changed and when I got to the table the kids were eating their dinner, as usual furiously wolfing down their food like a pair of street urchins who’d broken into a cake shop. Daisy was preparing my plate. Jack and Theresa were forever hungry, and the only time I can remember them not eating was after Daisy was buried and we had a gathering at the house, the two of them sitting glumly on the sofa, a plate of cold shrimp and capicola balanced between them on their legs.</p><p>Daisy set down my dinner, and she sat, too, but she wasn’t eating. After serving all of us seconds, she took our plates and began cleaning up. The kids chattered but Daisy and I didn’t say a word to each other. Breakfast the next morning was the same, and it was<span data-page="page_7"></span> like that for the rest of that week and the week after that. Finally, I got tired of the whole thing, and when Pop asked I told him that his method was fine except for the rageful misery and silences. He told me to keep it in my pants a bit longer, that I’d break her and also break myself of “the need to please her all the time,” and that he and Ma would stop by on Saturday to run interference. I asked him to come over and play with the kids, so I could patch things up with Daisy, perhaps take a drive to Robert Moses and sit on the grassy dunes and tell her that I wished for our life to be normal again, though in truth the visit would mean that Ma would take the kids out to the playground or to a matinée and then somehow cobble together a gut-busting dinner of meatballs and sausages and pasta and a roast, with Pop haranguing me about the state of our business and then inevitably bringing up Bobby.</p><p>When my parents arrived, Daisy was still in the bedroom getting dressed. No matter what her state of mind or what was going on, she always pulled herself together for them, and particularly for Pop. She’d wear her newest outfit and full makeup, and Pop, of course, lapped it up. He loved how she made silly mistakes in English and always laughed at his jokes and listened to his autodidact’s crank theories and opinions about the brutality of man and the falsity of religion and the conspiring forces of a new world order that would enslave all good men in a socialist vise-grip of eco-feminism and bisexuality and miscegenation (notwithstanding my and Daisy’s lovely offspring). No one but Pop could elicit that kind of humoring and attention from her, no one I’m sure except for Bobby Battle, M.I.A., whom she had never met but I know she would have loved.</p><p>Daisy floated out in a new hot-pink-with-white-polka-dot silk minidress and a matching scarf tied around her throat, with a white hair band holding up her black hair. She kissed my mother, who was already unloading from the fridge everything that we might possibly eat for dinner, culling as she went for mold and wilt and freezer burn. My mother was nothing if not dependable. It’s a terrible thing to admit, but I used to think she wasn’t the swiftest doe in the forest, because she rarely did anything but keep house and feed everybody and try to make Pop’s life run smoothly and comfortably, even when he had several affairs and was universally acknowledged to be a Hall of Fame pain in the ass. She rarely read the newspaper and never read a book and wasn’t even interested in movies or television; her main personal activity was shopping for clothes, always in a combination of Queens Boulevard and country-club styles, bright bold colors and white patent-leather bags and shoes and bug-eye sunglasses. Every once in a while, on no special occasion, Pop would spring for a marble-size diamond ring or a string of fat pearls, and I suspect it was my mother exacting tribute for his latest exposed dalliance. Lately I’ve been thinking that her lack was more emotional than intellectual; she preferred to keep her life as uncomplicated as possible, and understood that more thought would lead only to misery, to the realization that she could never leave him, that she could never really start over again.</p><p>Daisy twirled for my father and said, “What you think, Pop?”</p><p>“Gorgeous, doll, gorgeous.” Pop used “doll” whenever they were together, “your old lady” or “your wife” when speaking about her to me.</p><p>“I got it at Macy’s,” she said, hardly glancing over. “It wasn’t on sale price, but I couldn’t wait.”</p><p>“On you, it’s a bargain at twice the price.”</p><p>“You super guy, Pop.”</p><p>“But I’m speechless at this moment,” he said, smiling his here’s-how-tohandle-a-woman smile. “As Santayana once said, ‘Beauty as we feel it is something indescribable: what it is or what it means can never be said.’ ”</p><p>“You too much, Pop!”</p><p>“Is this a liver or a beefsteak?” Ma said, holding up a frozen brown slab.</p><p>No one answered, since no one knew.</p><p>Ma, accustomed to the non-reply, said, “I hope it’s a beefsteak.”</p><p>“The dress looks real good,” I said to Daisy, feeling I should say something. And then I was all set to offer more. I was going to suggest running her right out to the department store and buying a bauble to go with the pretty dress, some earrings maybe, when Pop pulled a long dark-blue velveteen jewelry case from his pocket and presented it to Daisy.</p><p>“For me?”</p><p>“Of course it’s for you, doll. Open it.”</p><p>She cracked the lid. It was a string of freshwater pearls, the beads small but delicate and dazzling in their iridescence. It was amazingly tasteful, even for Pop, who always surprised me with his eye for finish and detail.</p><p>“Look, Jerry, look what Pop got!” Daisy said.</p><p>“A customer of mine imports these from Japan, and he gave me a nice rate on them. They’re just as good as Mikimoto.”</p><p>“It’s not my birthday even,” Daisy said, hushed by the glitter in her hands. “This is so nice.”</p><p>“Call it a reward, for all the hardship of<span data-page="page_8"></span> the last couple of weeks. Ask Ma over there. It’s no picnic, putting up with us Battle men. We’re stubborn and proud and we ask no less than the world of our women. The world. Your husband Jerome here is no different. We all know he can be sullen, but that’s because he’s always been too serious. Not like Bobby, who knows what real fun is. He’s just like you. So you better learn patience, with this one.”</p><p>Pop tousled my hair, and I let him, because incredulity freezes you, because I was like that back then, because Pop was Pop and I wasn’t. Daisy was the one who stopped him, if only because she was hugging him, kissing him on the forehead and cheek, hooting a little, almost vibrating with glee and gratitude. Ma had already ceased paying further attention to the scene, and had gone back to the daily calculus of how to make a meal from what was at hand. The kids ran in from outside and Pop had a handful of hard candies for them, toffees and sours and butterscotches. This was the minor parade my father always finessed for himself, wherever he went: my wife and kids joyous with the old man. I asked Ma if she needed anything.</p><p>“I don’t think so, honey,” she said. She was scraping the brown rime from the frozen meat, a little pile of root-beer-colored shavings collecting at the edge of her knife blade. “I think I have everything I need.”</p><p>In the weeks after Pop came bearing gifts, everything pretty much went to shit. It did, it really did, though not in the manner I’d thought it would. I figured I’d be the one generating the enmity. I thought Pop’s stunt (which I should have been ready for) and Daisy’s giddy celebrations would lend me the pissy high ground, at least for a few days, long enough to keep Daisy on the defensive and not out there spending our future, long enough to allow me to figure out how to fix the problem without forever placing her under house arrest. But Daisy was the one who took umbrage. She wouldn’t speak to me, her silence made much more unpleasant by the fact that she seemed livelier and brighter in her dealings with everyone else.</p><p>Did the time mark a strange kind of renaissance for her? I really don’t know. What’s clear to me is that Daisy pretty much exploded with life, and our life exploded right along with her. Up to then, my basic conception of crazy was the one I’d held since youth: the picture of a raven-haired Irish girl named Clara who climbed the trees in her pleated Catholic-school skirt not wearing underwear and lobbed Emily Dickinson down to me in a wraithlike voice (“I cannot live with You— It would be Life—and Life is over there—Behind the Shelf”), my trousers clingy with fear and arousal.</p><p>With Daisy, neither I nor anyone else, not even Dr. Derricone, knew the extent of her troubles, the ornate reach and complication. Those initial shopping sprees would in the end seem like the smallest indiscretions—filched candy from the drugstore, a lingering ass pat at a neighborhood cocktail party—nothing you couldn’t slough off with a laugh, nothing you couldn’t later recall with some wistful fondness.</p><p>After that weekend when she stopped talking to me, Daisy’s metabolism went into overdrive. We usually went to bed at eleven or so, but she started getting up at five in the morning, and then four and three and two, until it got to the point where she didn’t even get ready for bed, not bothering to change into a nightgown or brush her teeth. A couple of times in the middle of the night I awoke to the <em>plash-plash</em> of water, and peered through the curtains to see, in lovely silhouette, Daisy paddling around in the pool with the inner tube hooped beneath her arms. She was naked, just going back and forth, and I had the thought that I should go out there and keep her company. But I desperately needed my sleep back then (these days it’s a different story, as I lie in wait for the muted <em>thwap</em> of the morning paper on the driveway) and, rather than get up, I would fall back into the pillow and scratch at myself half-mast and maybe dream in sentimental hues of gorgeous black swans who always swim alone.</p><p>After a couple of weeks, I didn’t even notice that Daisy was never in bed. She probably slept a few hours while the kids were in school, but I can’t be sure of that. As for sex, it wasn’t happening, and not only because she wasn’t talking to me. Pure talk was never that important to us anyway, even at the beginning, when we were mostly joking and flirting, for though her English was more than passable it was rudimentary enough for us to stay clear of nuanced discussions, which suited me fine. The truth was that while I was hungering for her I had an equally keen desire to hold out as long as I could, because if she had any power over me it was sexual power, which, most other things being equal, is what all women should easily have over all men. Daisy could always, please forgive me, float my boat, top<span data-page="page_9"></span> my prop; she could always crank up the generators at any moment and make me feel as if every last cell in my body were overjuiced and soon to be derelict if not immediately launched toward something warm and soft. In her own way she was a performer, as they say actors can be when they enter a room; something in them switches on and suddenly everybody is abject with confused misery and love.</p><p>One night the doorbell rang and roused me from a deep sleep and I opened the door to find my wife wrapped in a big blue poly tarp with a burly young police officer standing behind her, waving a long flashlight.</p><p>“Are you the head of this household, sir?” he asked, momentarily blinding me with the beam, and fully waking me up.</p><p>“You wanna kill the light, chief?”</p><p>“Sorry, sir,” he said, slipping the flashlight into his belt. “Are you the head of household?”</p><p>“If you mean am I the owner, then yes.”</p><p>“Is this your wife?”</p><p>I looked at Daisy, who looked glum, as though this were yet another chore of her unglamorous life.</p><p>“Yes. She’s my wife.”</p><p>“She was at the elementary school, in the playground there. There was a complaint.”</p><p>“What? Is it illegal, to be over there?”</p><p>“I believe there’s a school-grounds curfew, sir, but that wasn’t the whole problem.”</p><p>“Oh, yeah?”</p><p>Daisy then said, “Just cut it out, Jerry. Good night, officer. Thanks for the ride home.” She tippy-toed and pecked him on the cheek, and then stepped inside. “Oh, this is yours.”</p><p>She peeled the tarp from herself and handed it to him. She was wearing only sneakers, white Keds with the blue pencil stripe on the rubber. The young cop thanked her and said good night, as if it were a goddam date or something. Daisy disappeared inside.</p><p>The cop said, “Sir, if you could please tell your wife I’ll have to cite her the next time.”</p><p>“There’s not going to be a goddam next time!”</p><p>“I’m just saying—”</p><p>“Good night,” I said, and slammed the door.</p><p>I found Daisy in the kitchen, making egg salad for a sandwich. She had the eggs going at a furious boil in the stockpot, and the bread in the toaster; she had jars of mayonnaise and mustard and sweet-pickle relish out on the counter, celery and carrot and onion on the cutting board, and she had the ice-blue German chef’s knife in her hand, the one that Pop had given her for Christmas. But the strange thing was that it was all so casual, as if a nude woman in sneakers chopping vegetables at three in the morning after a neighborhood police sweep were de rigueur around here, our customary midsummer night’s dream.</p><p>“What the hell are you doing?”</p><p>“I’m hungry. You want to eat, too?”</p><p>“No, I don’t.”</p><p>“You have trouble sleeping?”</p><p>“What do you think, Daisy?”</p><p>She didn’t answer, engrossed as she was in the julienned stalks of carrot and celery. She was working carefully but fast, making perfect dices as she went, the crisp <em>chock-chock-chock</em> of the blade on the cutting board undoubtedly keeping time with her ever-quickening synaptic pulses. I didn’t want to disturb her; I was going to wait until she was done, but perhaps it was because of my state of angry half sleep or the searingly bright fluorescent kitchen lights or the notion of my supple-bodied immigrant wife tooling around in a squad car with a wide-eyed cop that I had to holler, “This is total shit!”</p><p>She looked around with unfeigned gravity and said, “Go back to sleep, Jerry.”</p><p>“This is going to stop,” I said. “You’re going to see Dr. Derricone tomorrow. I’ll go with you.”</p><p>“Go to sleep, Jerry.”</p><p>“You’re going to see him about this, and I mean it this time. No ranting at him. No threats. No scenes with his receptionist.”</p><p>“He’s a complete fool,” she said, with a perfect, faintly English accent, as if she’d heard some actress say the phrase in a TV movie or on a soap. Daisy was a talented mimic, when she wanted to be. “They are all complete and utter fools.”</p><p>“I don’t care if you think he’s the King of Siam. Dr. Derricone has been around a long time and you’ll show him respect. He’s seen it all and he’s going to help you.”</p><p>“I don’t want help from him, or nobody!” she cried, confusingly, though of course I knew what she meant.</p><p>“That’s it, now, Daisy! I mean it. I’ve had enough!”</p><p>“Me, too!” she shouted, and I thought about the kids for a second, how they’d wake up to their mother’s distressed cry and probably think I was doing something horrible to her, which I never ever did. Although in those days I let myself think about such things every now and then. I imagined picking up her petite body and flinging her onto the bed as you might a cat, mostly because I thought that she could handle it, and that the ugly pleasurable surge would somehow satisfy the moment and make everything good and right. Spoken like a veritable wife beater, I realize, and I can’t defend myself, except to say that Daisy was never a completely passive party in our troubles. She was ready to say or do whatever it took to make me feel the afflictions settled<span data-page="page_final"></span> so insolvently within her.</p><p>“Quiet down,” I told her. “You’ll wake up the kids.”</p><p>“I don’t care!” she cried, and that’s when it happened. She lunged at me, in her splendid nakedness, knife and all, her eyes dull with the chill of empty space. And I froze, not so much with fear (of which there was plenty) as with a kind of abstention, for the horror of what was happening was too realistic to even begin to consider fright. And the significant detail is not that Daisy missed my throat with the chef’s knife by a mere thumb’s width, jabbing the point a good two inches into the door of the refrigerator (the perfect slit is still there, rusty around the pushed-in edges), but that when we both fully returned to the moment, our faces almost touching, we each saw in the other the same amazing wish that she hadn’t flinched.</p><p>Not that I didn’t want to live.</p><p>I did want to live, just not that way.</p><p>Daisy, suddenly scared out of her craziness, broke down and collapsed in a naked heap on the linoleum floor, crying her eyes out.</p><p>So with the first light Dr. Derricone appeared with his scuffed black bag and before the kids were even awake he gave Daisy a sample bottle of Valium with instructions to keep taking them as long as she felt, as he put it, “too frisky.” I don’t know what a trained specialist would have said, what a psychiatrist or psychologist would have diagnosed as her particular state or behavior; I wasn’t even thinking of “the right thing to do.” I just needed to jam hard on the brakes, to do whatever it took to stop the train. Frank Derricone was Ma and Pop’s doctor; he’d delivered me and Bobby and dozens of my cousins and nephews and then Jack and Theresa. He was indeed a general practitioner of the grand old school, in that he believed that good doctoring, as in most professions, was a matter of common sense, empirically applied. This salty view had no doubt served him well for the thirty years up to that point, and continued to do so for the twenty-five or so more years afterward, and I don’t doubt that Daisy was among only a handful of his patients who didn’t end up healthy and long-lived. And while I don’t blame Frank Derricone in the least—I’m not the one who can, at least not in any scenario or space-time continuum or alternative universe I can come up with—I do wonder what might have been, and I can’t ignore what the doctor said to me at a party in honor of his retirement this past spring, when he mentioned that it probably wasn’t the best thing to have kept Daisy on sedatives after she’d come down from her manic heights. For who really imagined that there could be a state grayer than gray for our mad happy Daisy, lower than low, when suddenly it was all she could do to lift herself out of the bed in the morning and drag a brush through her tangled, unwashed hair? Who knew that while I was at work and the kids were at day camp she’d steadily medicate herself on the back patio with Valiums and a case of beer, and on one stifling summer afternoon in August go so far as to induce herself into a dream of buoyancy, such that she, unclothed as she preferred, drifted floatless into the pool, perhaps paddling a calm yard or two, before flying, like a seabird, straight down to the bottom. ♦</p>	Chang-rae Lee	January 12, 2004 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/01/12/daisy	Asians	Crazy	Daisy	Death	Drowning	Marriages	Unnamed	First	Death
In the South	<p>The <span data-page="page_1"></span>day that Junior fell down began like any other day: the explosion of heat rippling the air, the trumpeting sunlight, the traffic’s tidal surges, the prayer chants in the distance, the cheap film music rising from the floor below, the loud pelvic thrusts of an “item number” dancing across a neighbor’s TV, a child’s cry, a mother’s rebuke, unexplained laughter, scarlet expectorations, bicycles, the newly plaited hair of schoolgirls, the smell of strong sweet coffee, a green wing flashing in a tree. Senior and Junior, two very old men, opened their eyes in their bedrooms on the fourth floor of a sea-green building on a leafy lane, just out of sight of Elliot’s Beach, where, that evening, the young would congregate, as they always did, to perform the rites of youth, not far from the village of the fisherfolk, who had no time for such frivolity. The poor were puritans by night and day. As for the old, they had rites of their own and did not need to wait for evening. With the sun stabbing at them through their window blinds, the two old men struggled to their feet and lurched out onto their adjacent verandas, emerging at almost the same moment, like characters in an ancient tale, trapped in fateful coincidences, unable to escape the consequences of chance.</p><p>Almost at once they began to speak. Their words were not new. These were ritual speeches, obeisances to the new day, offered in call-and-response format, like the rhythmic dialogues or “duels” of the virtuosos of Carnatic music during the annual December festival.</p><p>“Be thankful we are men of the south,” Junior said, stretching and yawning. “Southerners are we, in the south of our city in the south of our country in the south of our continent. God be praised. We are warm, slow, and sensual guys, not like the cold fishes of the north.” Senior, scratching first his belly and then the back of his neck, contradicted him at once. “In the first place,” Senior said, “the south is a fiction, existing only because men have agreed to call it that. Suppose men had imagined the earth the other way up! We would be the northerners then. The universe does not understand up and down; neither does a dog. To a dog, there is no north or south. In this regard, the points of the compass are like money, which has value only because men say that it does. And in the second place you’re not that warm a character, and a woman would laugh to hear you call yourself sensual. But you are slow—that is beyond a doubt.”</p><p>This was how they were: they fought, going at each other like ancient wrestlers whose left feet were tied together at the ankles. The rope that bound them so tightly was their name. By a curious chance—which they had come to think of as “destiny” or, as they more often called it, “a curse”—they shared a name, a long name like so many names of the south, a name that neither of them cared to speak. By banishing the name, by reducing it to its initial letter, “V,” they made the rope invisible, which did not mean that it did not exist. They echoed each other in other ways—their voices were high, they were of a similarly wiry build and medium height, they were both nearsighted, and, after a lifetime of priding themselves on the quality of their teeth, they had both surrendered to the humiliating inevitability of dentures—but it was the unused name, that symmetrical V., the Name That Could Not Be Spoken, that had joined them together, like Siamese twins, for decades. The two old men did not share a birthday, however. One was seventeen days older than the other. That must have been how “Senior” and “Junior” got started, though the nicknames had been in use so long now that nobody could remember who had originally thought them up. V. Senior and V. Junior they had become, Junior V. and Senior V. forevermore, quarrelling to the death. They were eighty-one years old.</p><p>“You look terrible,” Junior told Senior, as he did every morning. “You look like a man who is only waiting to die.”</p><p>Senior—nodding gravely, and also speaking in accordance with their private tradition—responded, “That is better than looking, as you do, like a man who is still waiting to live.”</p><p>Neither man slept well anymore. At night they lay on hard beds without pillows and, behind their closed eyelids, their unsettled thoughts ran in opposite directions. Of the two men, V. Senior had lived by far the fuller life. He had been the youngest of ten brothers, all of whom had excelled in their chosen fields—as athletes, scientists, teachers, soldiers, priests. He himself had begun his career as a college-champion long-distance runner, had then risen to a senior position with the railway company, and for years had travelled the railroads, covering tens of thousands of miles to assure himself and the authorities that the proper safety levels were being maintained. He had married a kind woman and fathered six daughters and three sons, each of whom had proved fertile in his or her turn, providing him with a haul of thirty-three grandchildren. His nine brothers had sired a total of thirty-three more children, his nephews and nieces, who had inflicted upon him no<span data-page="page_2"></span> fewer than a hundred and eleven further relatives. To many this would have been proof of his good fortune, for a man blessed with two hundred and four family members was a rich man indeed, but abundance gave the ascetically inclined Senior a permanent low-level headache. “If I had been sterile,” he told Junior frequently, “how peaceful life would be.”</p><p>After his retirement, Senior had been one of a group of ten friends who met every day to discuss politics, chess, poetry, and music at a local Besant Nagar coffeehouse, and several of his commentaries on these topics had been published in the excellent daily newspaper based in the city. Among his friends was the editor of that newspaper, and also one of the editor’s employees—a celebrated local figure, a bit of a firebrand and too much of a boozer, but the creator of wonderfully grotesque political cartoons. Then there was the city’s finest astrologer, who had been trained as an astronomer but had come to believe that the true messages of the stars could not be received through a telescope; and a fellow who for many years had fired the starting pistol at the racetrack’s well-attended meets; and so on. Senior had revelled in the company of these men, telling his wife that it was a grand thing for a man to have friends from whom he could learn something new every day. But now they were all dead. His friends had gone up in flames one by one, and the coffeehouse that might have preserved their memory had been torn down, too. Of the ten brothers only he remained, and the brothers’ wives, too, were long departed. Even his own kindly wife was dead, and he had remarried, finding himself a woman with a wooden leg, toward whom he behaved with an irritability that surprised his children and grandchildren. “Not having much choice at my age,” he would say to her, hurtfully, “I chose you.” She retaliated by ignoring his simplest demands, even requests for water, which no civilized person should ever refuse. Her name was Aarthi, but he never used it. Nor did he call her by a diminutive or an endearment. To him she was always “Woman” or “Wife.”</p><p>Senior endured the multiple health problems of the very old, the daily penances of bowel and urethra, of back and knee, the milkiness climbing in his eyes, the breathing troubles, the nightmares, the slow failing of the soft machine. His days emptied out into tedious inaction. Once, he had given lessons in mathematics, singing, and the Vedas to pass the time. But his pupils had all gone away. There remained the wife with the wooden leg, the blurry television set, and Junior. It was not, by a long chalk, enough. Each morning he regretted that he had not died in the night. Of his two hundred and four family members, quite a few had already gone to their fiery rest. He forgot exactly how many, and their names, inevitably, eluded him. Many of the survivors came to see him and treated him with gentleness and care. When he said that he was ready to die, which was often, their faces took on hurt expressions and their bodies sagged or stiffened, depending on their nature, and they spoke to him reassuringly, encouragingly, and, of course, in injured tones, of the value of a life so full of love. But love had begun to annoy him, like everything else. His was a family of mosquitoes, he thought, a buzzing swarm, and love was their itchy bite. “If only there were a coil one could light to keep one’s relations away,” he told Junior. “If only there were a net around one’s cot that kept them out.”</p><p>Junior’s life had been a disappointment to him. He had not expected to be ordinary. He had been reared by doting parents who had instilled in him a sense of destiny and entitlement, but he had turned out to be an average sort of fellow, doomed by average academic achievement to a life of clerical work in the offices of the municipal water board. His above-average dreams—of road travel, rail travel, air travel, perhaps even space travel—had long since been abandoned. Yet he was not an unhappy man. The discovery of his affliction with the incurable disease of mediocrity might have cowed a less ebullient spirit, but he remained bright-eyed, with a ready smile for the world. Still, in spite of his apparent enthusiasm for life, there was a certain deficiency in the energy department. He did not run but walked, and walked slowly—had done so even in the distant years of his youth. He abhorred exercise and had a way of poking gentle fun at those who took it. Nor did he interest himself in politics, or the all-pervasive popular culture of the cinema and the music that it spawned. In all significant particulars, he had failed to be a participant in the parade of life. He had not married. The great events of eight decades had managed to occur without any effort on his part to help them along. He had stood by and watched as an empire fell and a nation rose, and avoided expressing an opinion on the matter. He had been a man at a desk. Maintaining the flow of the municipality’s water had been a sufficient<span data-page="page_3"></span> challenge for him. Yet he gave every appearance of being a man for whom living was still a joy. He had been an only child, so there were few relatives to look out for him in his advanced years. Senior’s immense family had adopted him long ago and brought him tiffin and attended to his needs.</p><p>The question of the dividing wall between Senior’s and Junior’s adjoining apartments was sometimes raised by the visiting hordes of Senior’s blood kin: whether it should be taken down so that the two old men could share their lives more easily. On this matter, however, Junior and Senior spoke with one voice.</p><p>“No!” Junior said.</p><p>“Over my dead body,” Senior clarified.</p><p>“Which would make the whole exercise pointless, anyhow,” Junior said, as if that settled things.</p><p>The wall remained in place.</p><p>Junior had one friend, D’Mello, a man twenty years younger than him, an old colleague from his water-board days. D’Mello had grown up in another city, Mumbai, the legendary bitch-city, <em>urbs prima in Indis</em>, and had to be spoken to in English. Whenever D’Mello visited Junior, Senior sulked and refused to speak, even though, secretly, he was proud of his prowess in what he called “the world’s No. 1 tongue.” Junior tried to hide from Senior how much he looked forward to D’Mello’s comings; the younger man bubbled with a kind of cosmopolitan brio that Junior found inspirational. D’Mello always arrived with stories—sometimes angry accounts of injustices against the poor in a Mumbai slum, sometimes funny anecdotes about the characters who took their ease at the Wayside Inn, the famous Mumbai café in the Kala Ghoda area, named for a no longer present equestrian statue, “the Black Horse district from which the black horse has been exiled.” D’Mello fell in love with movie stars (from a distance, of course), and provided gory details of the killing spree of a not-yet-arrested madman in the district of Trombay. “The miscreant is still at large!” he cried gaily. His conversation was littered with wonderful names: Worli Sea Face, Bandra, Hornby Vellard, Breach Candy, Pali Hill. These places sounded altogether more exotic than the prosaic localities to which Junior was accustomed: Besant Nagar, Adyar, Mylapore.</p><p>D’Mello’s most heartbreaking Mumbai story was his tale of the great poet of the city, who had surrendered to Alzheimer’s disease. The poet still walked to his small magazine-infested office every day, without knowing why he went there. His feet knew the way, and so he went and sat looking into space until it was time to go home again and his feet walked him back to his shabby residence, through the evening crowds massing outside Churchgate station—the jasmine sellers, the hustling urchins, the roar of the B.E.S.T. buses, the girls on their Vespas, the sniffing, hungry dogs.</p><p>When D’Mello was present and talking, Junior had the sense that he was living another, very different life, a life of action and color; that he was becoming, vicariously, the type of man he had never been—dynamic, passionate, engaged with the world. Senior, observing the light in Junior’s eyes, inevitably became cross. One day, when D’Mello was speaking of Mumbai and its people with his habitual, gesticulating fervor, Senior, breaking his rule of silence, snapped at him in English, “Why your body doesn’t return there only since your head has already gone?” But D’Mello shook his head sadly. He no longer had a foothold in his city of origin. Only in his dreams and conversations was it still his home. “I will die here,” he answered Senior. “In the south, among sour fruits like you.”</p><p>Senior’s wife, the lady with the wooden leg, increasingly took her revenge upon her unloving husband by filling their apartment with family members. She, too, came from a large family, of hundreds of persons, and she began most particularly to invite her younger relations, the great-nephews and great-nieces, with their wives and husbands and, especially, their babies in tow. The presence in the small apartment of large numbers of babies, toddlers, high-speed pigtailed girls, and slow plump boys fulfilled her own matriarchal ambitions, and also, very satisfyingly, drove Senior wild. It was the babies-in-law that really got his goat. The babies-in-law rattled their rattles and giggled their giggles and screamed their baby screams. They slept, and then Senior had to be quiet, or they woke up, and then Senior could not hear himself think. They ate and defecated and puked, and the smell of excrement and vomit remained in the apartment, even when the babies-in-law had gone, mingling with a smell that Senior disliked even more: that of talcum powder. “At the end of life,” he complained to Junior, in whose apartment he often took refuge from the squalling hordes of his and his wife’s blood kin, “nothing stinks worse than the smells of life’s sweet beginning—bibs and ribbons and warm bottled milk and formula, and farting, talcumed behinds.” Junior could not help replying, “Soon you also will be helpless and need someone to tend to your natural functions. Babydom is not only our past but our future, too.” The thunderous expression on Senior’s face revealed that the words had hit their mark.</p><p>For, it’s true, they were both fortunate men. They were neither wholly blind nor wholly deaf, and their minds had not betrayed them like the Mumbai poet’s. The food they ate was soft and<span data-page="page_4"></span> easily digestible, but it was not old buggers’ mush. Above all they were still ambulatory, still able, once a week, to climb slowly down their building’s stairs to street level, and then to shuffle along, helped by walking sticks and frequent little rest stops, to the local post office, where they cashed their pension slips. They did not need to do this. Many of the young who thronged Senior’s apartment, driving him next door to quarrel with Junior, would readily have dashed down the street to cash the checks for the frail old gentlemen. But the gentlemen did not care to allow the young to dash for them. It was a point of pride to cash one’s own pension slip—on this, if on nothing else, they agreed—to travel under one’s own steam to the counter where, behind a metal grille, a postal-services operative waited to dispense the weekly sum that was their return for a lifetime’s service. “You can see the respect in the fellow’s expression,” Senior said loudly to Junior, who kept mum, because what he saw behind the grille was something more like boredom, or contempt.</p><p>To Senior the pension trip was an act of validation; the weekly sum, small as it was, honored his deeds, transmuting into banknotes society’s gratitude for his life. Junior thought of the journey more as an act of defiance. “You care nothing for me,” he once said flatly to the face behind the grille. “It means nothing to you to count out the cash. But, when your turn comes to stand where I stand, then you will comprehend.” One of the few privileges of very old age was that you were allowed to say exactly what you thought, even to strangers. Nobody told you to keep your mouth shut, and few people had the guts to answer back. They think we will soon be dead, Junior thought, so there’s no point getting into a fight with us. He understood the nature of the contempt in the eyes of the post-office employee. It was the scorn of life for death.</p><p>On the day that Junior fell down, he and Senior set forth on their errand at their customary midmorning hour. It was late in the year. The local Christians, D’Mello included, had just finished celebrating their Savior’s birth, and the consequent proximity of New Year’s Eve—with its promise of a future, of, indeed, an interminable future in which a sequence of such Eves stretched out at their predetermined intervals toward infinity—was bothering Senior. “Either I will die in the next five days, meaning that there will be no new year for me,” he told Junior, “or else a year will begin in which my end will surely come, which is hardly a thing to look forward to.” Junior sighed. “Your gloom and doom,” he moaned, “will be the death of me.” This sentence struck them both as so funny that they laughed heartily, and then for a while they had to huff and puff for breath. They were descending their building’s staircase at this point, so the laughter was not without danger. They clung to the bannisters and panted. Junior was lower down than Senior, past the second-floor landing. This was how they customarily descended, some distance apart, so that if one of them should fall he would not drag the other down with him. They were too unsteady to trust each other. Trust, too, was a casualty of age.</p><p>In the front yard they paused briefly by the golden-shower tree that stood there. They had watched it grow from a tiny shoot to its present sixty-foot grandeur. It had grown quickly, and, though they did not say so, this rapid growth had disturbed them, suggesting, as it did, the speed of the passing of the years. The Indian laburnum: that was another name for it, a name among many names. It was <em>konrai</em> in their own, southern language, <em>amaltas</em> in the tongue of the north, <em>Cassia fistula</em> in the language of flowers and trees. “It has stopped growing now,” Junior said, approvingly, “having understood that eternity is better than progress. In the eye of God, time is eternal. This even animals and trees can comprehend. Only men have the illusion that time moves.” Senior snorted. “The tree has stopped,” he said, “because that is in its nature, just as it is in ours. We, too, will stop soon enough.” He placed his gray trilby on his head and moved through the gate into the lane. Junior was bareheaded and traditionally dressed in a white <em>veshti</em> and a long blue checked shirt and sandals, but Senior liked to go to the post office in the guise of a European gentleman, wearing a suit and hat and twirling a silver-handled walking stick, like that Beau-somebody of Piccadilly of whom he had read, or the man in the old song he liked, <em>who walked along the Bois de Boulogne with an independent air</em>, the Man That Broke the Bank at Monte Caaar-lo.</p><p>The shady lane gave way to the brilliant sun-soaked street, where the noise of traffic drowned out the softer music of the sea. The beach was just four blocks away, but the city didn’t care. Junior and Senior shuffled slowly past the homeopathy shop, the pharmacy where prescription drugs could easily be bought without troubling any doctor, the general store, with its<span data-page="page_5"></span> jars of nuts and chilies, its tins of clarified butter and its imported cheese, and the sidewalk bookstall, with its many pirated editions of popular books brazenly on display, and set their sights on the traffic lights a hundred yards ahead. There they would have to cross the lawless main road, where a dozen forms of transport battled for space. After that a left turn, and another hundred yards of walking, and then they would be at the post office. A five-minute journey for the young, half an hour each way, minimum, for the two old men. The sun was behind them, and both men, inching slowly forward, were looking down at their shadows, which lay side by side upon the dusty pavement. Like lovers, they both thought, but neither of them spoke, their habit of opposition being too ingrained to permit them to express so fond an idea.</p><p>Afterward, Senior regretted that he had not spoken. “He was my shadow,” he said to the woman with the wooden leg, “and I was his. Two shadows, each shadowing the other, to that we were reduced, that is so. The old move through the world of the young like shades, unseen, of no concern. But the shadows see each other and know who they are. So it was with us. We knew, let me say this, who we were. And now I am a shadow without a shadow to shadow. He who knew me knows nothing now, and therefore I am not known. What else, woman, is death?”</p><p>“The day you stop talking,” she replied. “The day these tomfool notions stop dropping from your mouth. When your mouth itself has been eaten by the fire. That will be the day.” It was the most she had said to him in more than a year, and he understood from it that she hated him, and was sorry that Junior was the one who had fallen.</p><p>It happened because of the girls on the Vespa, the girls on their new Vespa making their way to college, pigtails horizontal behind them as, giggling, they rode toward murder. Their faces were vivid in Senior’s mind, the long thin one driving the scooter and her chubbier friend behind her, holding on <em>for dear life</em>. But life was not dear to such persons. Life was cheap, like a garment idly flung away after a single use, like their music, like their thoughts. This was how he judged them, and when he discovered afterward that they were not at all like his unjust characterization it was too late to change his mind. They were serious students, the thin one of electrical engineering and the other of architecture, and, far from being unaffected by the accident, they both went into dreadful, guilt-ridden shock, and for weeks afterward they could be seen almost every day standing silently with lowered heads across the lane from Junior’s home, just standing there, heads bowed in expiation, waiting for forgiveness. But there was nobody to forgive them; the one who would have done so had died, and the one who could have done so would not. Haughty Senior looked down upon them with disdain. What did they think a human life was? Could it be so cheaply bought off? No, it could not. Let them stand there for a thousand years, it would not be long enough.</p><p>The Vespa had wobbled, no doubt about that; its young driver was inexperienced and it had wobbled too close to where Junior stood, waiting to cross the road. Of late he had been complaining of a weakness in his ankles. He had said, “Sometimes when I get out of bed I do not think that they will bear my weight.” He had also said, “Sometimes when I go down the stairs I worry that an ankle will turn. I never used to worry about my ankles, but now I do.” Senior had responded adversarially, as was customary. “Worry about your interior,” he had said. “Your kidneys or your liver will fail long before your ankle does.” However, he had been wrong. The Vespa had come too close and Junior had leaped back. When he landed on his left foot, his ankle had indeed turned, and that had induced a second half-leap, as Junior tried to save himself. So it had been a strange fall, more like a hop and a skip, but at the end there was the tumble, and Junior, toppling backward to the sidewalk, had bumped his head, not hard enough to be knocked out, but, still, hard enough. He was winded, too. Air left him in a great <em>whoosh</em> as he clattered down.</p><p>Senior was too busy shouting at the terrified girls on the Vespa, calling them assassins and worse things, to notice the moment when the thing happened that must happen to us all in the end, when the last little puff of vapor pops out of our mouths and dissolves into fetid air. “The spirit, whatever it is,” Junior used to say. “I do not believe in an immortal soul, but I also do not believe that we are only flesh and bone. I believe in a mortal soul, the non-corporeal essence of ourselves, lurking within our flesh like a parasite, flourishing when we flourish, and dying when we die.” Senior was more formal in his religious beliefs. He read the<span data-page="page_6"></span> ancient texts often, and the sound of Sanskrit was for him akin to the music of the spheres—the subtlety and profundity of those texts, which were capable of questioning whether even the creative entity itself understood its creation. Once, he had discussed these texts with his students, but there had not been any students for a long time, and he had been obliged to keep his own counsel on the grand matters of being. The ancient ambiguities gave him joy; Junior’s lay-philosophical invention of a soul that died was banal by comparison.</p><p>So Senior thought, and, ranting as he was, he missed the telltale little puff of air that might have persuaded him to think again. An instant later there was no Junior anymore, just a body on the sidewalk, a thing to be disposed of before the heat of the tropics did its malodorous worst. There was only one thing to be done. Senior reached into his friend’s pocket and took out the pension slip. Then, sending the Vespa girls to his apartment to speak to his wife and relations, he set off on his mission alone. There would be time for death to be respected. In the traditions of the Palakkad Aiyars or Iyers, from whom both he and Junior were descended, the rites in honor of the dead lasted for thirteen days.</p><p>The next morning, in the south of the planet, far away from Senior’s home town, but not far enough, there was a great earthquake under the ocean’s surface, and the mighty water, answering the agony of the land beneath it with an agony of its own, gathered itself up into a series of waves and hurled its pain across the globe. Two such waves travelled across the Indian Ocean and, at a quarter to seven in the morning, Senior felt his bed begin to shake. It was a violent and puzzling vibration, because there had never been an earthquake in this city. Senior got up and went out onto his veranda. The veranda next door was empty, of course. Junior was gone. Junior was ashes now. The neighbors were all out in the lane, improperly dressed, hugging blankets around their shoulders. Everyone had a radio on. The earthquake’s epicenter had been near the distant island of Sumatra. The tremors stopped and people went on with their day. Two and a quarter hours later, the first giant wave arrived.</p><p>The coastal areas were smashed. Elliot’s Beach, Marina Beach, the beachfront houses, the cars, the Vespas, the people. At ten o’clock in the morning, the sea made a second such assault. The numbers of the dead grew: the lost dead, taken by the sea, the marooned dead, washed up on the remnants of the sands, the broken dead, everywhere the dead. The waves did not get as far as Senior’s house. Senior’s lane was undamaged. Everybody lived.</p><p>Except Junior.</p><p>It was fortunate that the waves arrived at Elliot’s Beach in the morning. The romantic young who laughed and flirted there in the evenings would all have been slain if the waves had come at night. So young friends and lovers survived. The fishermen were not so lucky. The nearby fishing village—its name was Nochikuppam—ceased to exist. A seaside temple remained standing, but the fishermen’s huts and catamarans and many of the fisherfolk themselves were lost. After that day the fishermen who survived said that they hated the sea and refused to return to it. For a long time it was hard to buy fish in the markets.</p><p>Senior did not like the Japanese word everyone used to name the waters of death. To him the waves were Death itself and needed no other name. Death had come to his city, had come a-harvesting and had taken Junior and many strangers away. In the aftermath of the waves, there grew up all around him, like a forest, the noises and actions that inevitably follow on calamity—the good behavior of the kind, the bad behavior of the desperate and the powerful, the surging aimless crowds. He was lost in the forest of the aftermath and saw nothing except the empty veranda next to his own and, in the lane below, the girls with the lowered heads. News came that D’Mello was among the lost. D’Mello, too, was gone. Perhaps he was not dead. Perhaps he had simply gone home, at last, to his storied city of Mumbai, on the country’s other coast, that city which was neither of the north nor of the south but a frontierville, the greatest, most wondrous, and most dreadful of all such places, the megalopolis of the borderlands, the place of in-between. Or, on the other hand, perhaps D’Mello had drowned and Death, swallowing him, had denied his body the Christian dignity of a grave.</p><p>He, Senior, was the one who had asked for death. Yet Death had left him alive, had taken so many others, had taken even Junior and D’Mello, but left him untouched. The world was meaningless. There was no meaning to be found in it, he thought. The texts were empty and his eyes were blind. Perhaps he said some of this aloud. He may even have shouted it out. The girls in the lane below were looking up at him, and the green birds in the golden-shower tree were disturbed. Then, all of a sudden, he imagined that<span data-page="page_final"></span> across the way, on the empty adjacent veranda, he saw a shadow move. He had cried out, “Why not me?,” and in response a shadow had flickered where Junior used to stand. Death and life were just adjacent verandas. Senior stood on one of them as he always had, and on the other, continuing their tradition of many years, was Junior, his shadow, his namesake, arguing. ♦</p>	Salman Rushdie	May 18, 2009 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/05/18/in-the-south	Alzheimer’s disease	Arguments	Beaches	Death	Earthquakes	Falls	Senior	Third	Death
Julia And Byron	<p>When <span data-page="page_1"></span>Julia was twenty-nine, her hair was already bar-coded. Now, at sixty-two, it was a solid helmet of bright pewter, level with her lean, brown jawbone. As she looked at her wedding ring, she could observe the bold play of tendons on the back of her tanned thin hands. The student doctor was telling her that she had cancer. Of the bone marrow.</p><p>He had found her reading her file—left on the desk by the consultant—and assumed that she already knew the diagnosis. Perhaps he thought her doctorate in zoology was a doctorate in medicine. He wanted to be nice. “Myeloma. Broad term, actually. In your case,” he gestured at the crisp yellow folder on which her hands were resting, “it’s serious—well, it’s always serious—but not hopeless.”</p><p>His fingernails were clean and cut short. She liked that.</p><p>And he wasn’t entirely wrong about her medical knowledge. After the initial tests, she’d done some reading and asked various doctor friends a few questions. She’d looked on the Web. So she had a shrewd and accurate idea of her chances—two to five years, or, possibly, if her condition was stabilized, a longer, indeterminate period. She might reach seventy, with luck. Longer if she was luckier.</p><p>When the consultant, Aaronovitch, returned and proposed to take her into his confidence, she pretended complete ignorance—to protect the student doctor and to hear the fullest possible account of her illness. Aaronovitch’s diagnosis differed from the student doctor’s in no significant particular.</p><p>“I should tell you, Mr. Aaronovitch,” Julia said, “what you couldn’t possibly know unless you’ve got my G.P.’s notes from way back—that my blood count has always been very low. I mean, before all this. When I was well. So I’d say that I may be less ill than I look. On paper. So to speak.”</p><p>Her acute hearing picked up the sound of his hairy hand palpating his chin. The sound of static. To show Julia that he was thinking. Considering. Weighing. Being judicious. Finally, he folded his arms across his waistcoat, leaned back in his chair, inclined his head a little, looked directly into Julia’s eyes—and proposed the experimental treatment that he had been contemplating for six months before the onset of her symptoms had brought her to his hospital.</p><p>“In that case,” he said, “blood to make up the count, and chemo. One pill a month. That’s all. New thing. Massively powerful, of course. But definitely worth a try. Might just do the trick.” He clicked his Montblanc Rollerball twice.</p><p>They looked each other in the eye.</p><p>“They sent for some doctors / In sneezles / And wheezles,” Julia said gravely. “To tell them what ought / To be done.”</p><p>Mr. Aaronovitch lifted a quizzical eyebrow.</p><p>“All sorts and conditions / Of famous physicians / Came hurrying round / At a run,” Julia answered, without smiling. “You’re the expert, that’s all.”</p><p>The medication had a beautiful name. Mandragorax. Made by a pharmaceutical company that knew its Shakespeare.</p><p>In six months it had completely stripped the nerves of her hands. She could feel nothing.</p><p>After the failure of Mandragorax to do anything except damage Julia, Mr. Aaronovitch adopted more conventional treatment—a gradualist chemotherapy, administered by IV and closely monitored in the hospital over half a day and a night. Julia endured nausea and massive temperature fluctuations—her green hospital shift black with sweat and vacuum-packed against her scalded body. But no hair loss.</p><p>She began to stabilize. She played tennis. She swam.</p><p>Here she is, her skin the reddish-brown of bresaola, trapping tennis balls between racquet and foot, crooking her knee, patting the plush. Here is the sweat shadow left by her hand on the red leather racquet handle. So tanned that her eyelids are pale if—<em>pain</em>—she closes her eyes. Here she is, bald—lifting the squeaky flap of her white rubber bathing hat to tuck out of sight strands of her livid hair. Folds, a cape of chlorinated water, gather at her neck as she strokes down the pool in little pulses, touches with two hands together, and turns in an eddy. She is a burglar in her black goggles and striped bathing costume. In the changing room, she hooks a finger under the rubber helmet and shakes her hair free. Bright gray, damp at the tips.</p><p>Mr. Aaronovitch was surprised by her comparative recovery, surprised that her immune system was still operational and effective, given its virtual extinction a few months before. He persuaded Julia to take part in another experiment. His argument was calculated to appeal to her scientific instinct. Though unlikely to succeed in the short term, the new treatment might be valuable in the long term. Julia’s proven powers of recuperation suggested to Aaronovitch that this new course of chemo, though carrying a significant risk, was unlikely to be fatal. Its development, the necessary crucial refinements, however, depended on the use of a human guinea pig.</p><p>Julia thought of her beloved lab rats—the healthy and sleek, the medicated and ungainly, carrying their single tumors like Quasimodo, their double tumors like Bactrians. And she signed the contract with Mr. Aaronovitch’s Montblanc Rollerball. <em>Click-click</em>. The contract promised that antibiotics would not be withheld.</p><p>In the event, they were withheld. “If you could just hang in there a little bit longer, Julia.” Mr. Aaronovitch had stopped calling her Dr. Duddington when she had stopped being his patient and become, as it<span data-page="page_2"></span> were, a colleague, on the signing of the contract.</p><p>Here she is in her hospital gown—too tired to tie the telltails behind her. Her buttocks have vanished. You can see her coccyx. There is hair all over her body. She can hardly make her jaws move to eat. Her throat is so ulcerated that swallowing is impossible. An amber mosaic. Her tongue is black-indigo. She cannot keep food down.</p><p>Talking is difficult. So many movements required that it takes her ten minutes, with rests between every whispered word, to say the first line of “They all made a note / Of the state of her throat.” It is so painful for Julia that Byron, her husband, tries to complete the second line as soon as he recognizes the quotation. But he fails at the pronoun—his? her?—and is so upset he has to leave the room.</p><p>When Mr. Aaronovitch agreed at last to the suspension of treatment and the resumption of antibiotics, she was unable to take them orally. Byron had to push the suppositories up her rectum, taking gobs and shreds of flesh with them.</p><p>She bled from her vagina and rectum and, as she declined, began to soil herself. At the end, she was very weak and found it hard to walk. Byron took her upstairs, holding her thin hands. Her face was very pale, so pale she looked as if she were wearing lipstick.</p><p>He said, “You’re very weak. You’re finding it hard to walk.”</p><p>She smiled and water came out of her mouth and she died in his arms.</p><p>After the undertaker had left, Byron kissed her and realized how dead she was. She had gone. She wasn’t there. But he couldn’t put the lid on the coffin. After three days, the molded symmetrical smile began to pull to one side. It began to look more like a smirk. He wondered if he should turn off the central heating all over the house, not just in the spare room.</p><p>Byron was unable to sleep, so he sat in Julia’s study, in the kneeling chair, working his way through the diaries she had kept in a beige filing cabinet. They recorded his bad behavior during their twenty-year marriage. Where were the tender moments? Unrecorded. He read on, compelled, remorseful, weeping, nodding off now and then, only to be woken by his own sobs. “B impossible. Drunk at Encaenia garden party. Told principal everyone bisexl. Sodomized at Central School S &amp; D: enjoyed it. Explained that proximity of prostate to rectum wall accounts for male pleasure. Only drawback loose stools next morning. But that wd apply to wm also. In car I sd: B, why do you do this? What? What do I do? Make things up. You’re like a kid. Anything to be center of attentn. Fuck off. Rather be fucked up arse by poofter than service you.”</p><p>All his jealousies, all his tantrums, all his sulks were here in the diaries, written up like experiments, in Julia’s methodical notation. And only Byron knew that these episodes were oblique expressions of his love for her. They had no children. She had been forty when they married and was committed to her career. Sometimes she’d joked that she had a daughter called Trilobites. So children had been out of the question—which had suited him fine—but he’d got into the habit of creating a scene whenever he felt her concentration falter, flicker, withdraw. Byron had wanted her attention undivided.</p><p>He had succeeded. “Dread B’s rants. Think about them all time. Back of my mind all time. Hates me. Why?” He found no expressions of love.</p><p>“I stripped the nerves of her heart,” he would say in the street to any of their mutual friends. “I was the chemo before the chemo. So domineering, so rude, so impossible. Christ, you should read her diaries. You find out. You think, She knows I care. But you find out she doesn’t. She doesn’t know. I tortured her.”</p><p>And he would stand there crying, even after the friend had escaped. He didn’t burst into tears. He was already in tears as soon as he saw anyone who had known her. “I never learn. I never fucking learn, do I? Even the funeral. Even that. I made all the guests go in the Land Rover. And I made a fucking scene. I was embarrassing.”</p><p>He had gone on all of Julia’s field trips with her in the Land Rover. At the graveside, there was a freak summer hailstorm. Byron’s black tie was pasted to his shirt. His face was so wet you couldn’t tell how hard he was crying. He took out a copy (with worn corners) of “Now We Are Six” and tried to read “Us Two.” The first stanza was a fight for control, looking away from the wet page, lips parted and dripping. The hailstones thrashed and popped. Where the clay began, the earth looked like tiger stone. Then everything seemed to speed up, until the final stanza—which took a lifetime because Byron’s mouth became suddenly difficult and stiff.</p><p>So wherever I am, there’s always Pooh,</p><p>There’s always Pooh and Me.</p><p>“What would I do,” I said to Pooh,</p><p>“If it wasn’t for you,” and Pooh said:</p><p>“True,</p><p>It<span data-page="page_final"></span> isn’t much fun for One, but Two</p><p>Can stick togeth . . .</p><p>The slewed mouth of a stroke victim.</p><p>Byron flung himself on the wet coffin, which slipped out of his embrace and dropped a wreath of chrysanthemums. He fell. One knee was muddied, and somehow his nose began to bleed.</p><p>For two years he was a grief Automat, crying unstoppably at the mention of her name. Then he remarried—a younger woman—and was a difficult husband. ♦</p>	Craig Raine	March 30, 2009 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/03/30/julia-and-byron	Cancer	Chemotherapy	Death	Diaries	Doctors	Drugs	Byron	Third	Death
Ladies’ Lunch	<p>It mattered that Lotte’s apartment was commodious. Lotte liked to boast that when she lay in bed and looked past the two closest water towers, past the architectural follies and oddities few people notice on Manhattan’s rooftops, she saw all the way to the Empire State Building. On the velvet sofa in Lotte’s living room, from which she could observe the Hudson River traffic as far as the George Washington Bridge, the caregiver sat watching television.</p><p>“Get rid of her,” Lotte said.</p><p>Samson dropped his voice, as if this might make his mother lower hers. “As soon as we find you a replacement.”</p><p>“And I’ll get rid of <em>her</em>,” Lotte said.</p><p>Sam said, “We’ll go on interviewing till we find you the right one.”</p><p>“Who will let me eat my bread and butter?”</p><p>“Mom,” Sam said, “bread turns into sugar, as you know very well.”</p><p>“And don’t care,” Lotte said.</p><p>“If she lets you eat bread for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, she’ll get fired.”</p><p>“Good,” said Lotte.</p><p>•</p><p>“Sarah,” Sam said to the caregiver, “I’ll take my mother to her ladies’ lunch if you’ll pick her up at three-thirty?”</p><p>“That O.K. with you?” Sarah asked Lotte.</p><p>“No,” said Lotte.</p><p>•</p><p>“Ladies’ lunch” is pronounced in quotation marks. The five women have grown old coming together, every other month or so for the last thirty or more years, around one another’s table. Ruth, Bridget, Farah, Lotte, and Bessie are longtime New Yorkers; their origins in California, County Mayo, Tehran, Vienna, and the Bronx might have grounded them but do not in these days often surface.</p><p>Ruth was a retired lawyer. She said, “I’ve forgotten, of course, who it was said that there are four or five people in the world to whom we tell things, and that’s us. Something happens and I think, I’ll tell the next ladies’ lunch.”</p><p>“True! It’s true,” Lotte said. “When I suddenly sat on my rear on the sidewalk outside my front door, I was looking forward to telling you.”</p><p>Lotte had turned out to need a hip replacement. Dr. Goodman, the surgeon, was a furry man like a character in an Ed Koren cartoon, only jollier. He had promised Lotte, “From here on it’s all good.”</p><p>“I’m eighty-two years old,” Lotte had said.</p><p>Goodman told her, “I’m on my way to the ninety-second birthday of a patient whose knees I replaced eleven years ago.”</p><p>Bessie said, “And I told you, from my poor Colin’s experience, that the recovery is not so much like Goodman’s cheery projection.” These days, it depended on the state of Colin’s health and Colin’s mood whether Bessie was able to take the train in from Old Rockingham.</p><p>•</p><p>Today’s lunch was at Bridget’s, so she got to set the agenda: “ ‘How to Prevent the Inevitable.’ I mean any of the scenarios we would rather die than live in.” Bridget was a writer who still spent mornings at her computer.</p><p>Farah, a recently retired doctor, said, “The old problem of shuffling off this mortal coil.”</p><p>“Of shuffling off,” Lotte said.</p><p>“And it was you who said you wanted to see it all, to see what would happen to the end,” Farah reminded Lotte.</p><p>“I wasn’t counting on the twenty-four-hour caregiver or the heart-healthy diet,” said Lotte. “You doctors need to do a study of the correlation between salt-free food and depression.”</p><p>“Your Sarah seems pleasant enough,” Ruth said. “What’s wrong with her?”</p><p>“That she’s in my living room,” Lotte said, “watching television; that she’s in my kitchen eating her lunch, which she does standing up; that she’s in my spare room asleep, and in my bathroom whenever I want to go in.”</p><p>Ruth asked Lotte what Sarah did for her. “Do you need a caregiver to help you dress?”</p><p>“No,” Lotte said.</p><p>“You need a caregiver to help you shower?”</p><p>“No,” Lotte said.</p><p>“Get your meals?”</p><p>“God, _no! _”</p><p>“So what do you need help with?”</p><p>“The caregiver,” Lotte said.</p><p>“Go away,” she said to Sarah, who had come to take her home. The four friends’ mouths dropped to see their friend raise her arm at the caregiver and slap the air.</p><p>•</p><p>They were of an age when they worried if one of them did not answer her telephone.</p><p>Bessie, Lotte’s oldest friend, had known Sam since he was a baby. She called him from Connecticut. “Why doesn’t the caregiver pick up Lotte’s phone?”</p><p>“She’s gone. There was just too much abuse.”</p><p>“You’re kidding me! What? That nice Sarah? You’re talking elder abuse?”</p><p>“More like caregiver abuse,” Sam said.</p><p>“Like what?”</p><p>“Like Mom would change the channel Sarah was watching on the TV. She’d come into the kitchen and pack away the food Sarah was preparing for her lunch, and turn on the light when Sarah was asleep. It was getting bizarre. I’m here waiting with her for the new woman.”</p><p>•</p><p>Bessie e-mailed the friends in New York to look in on Lotte.</p><p>Bridget went to see Lotte. Bridget, Lotte, and Shareen, the new caregiver, sat looking out on Riverside Drive. Lotte said, “Shareen drives in from New Jersey. Shareen has a five-year-old who brushes his own teeth. Shareen told him that if he doesn’t brush, a roach will grow in his mouth.”</p><p>Bessie phoned Lotte. “How is the new caregiver?”<span data-page="page_2"></span></p><p>“Intrusive,” said Lotte.</p><p>When Farah called Lotte, it was Sam who picked up the phone. “Shareen is gone. Mom locked her—I can’t make out if it was into or out of the bathroom, but it wasn’t that. Shareen did not want to have to manhandle Mom to stop her eating sugar by the spoonfuls.”</p><p>“Lotte is angry,” Farah said. “After making your own decisions your life long, it must be hell having someone tell you what you can eat and when to shower and what to wear.”</p><p>“Because her own decisions are not tenable,” Sam said. “Greg is coming in from Chicago.” Gregor was Lotte’s younger son. “We’re going to check out this nice assisted-living home. It sounds really nice. Upscale.”</p><p>“Sam? You’re moving Lotte out of her apartment?”</p><p>“To a nice home in the country.”</p><p>“A home in the country. You discussed this move with Lotte?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“And she has agreed?”</p><p>“Well, yes, she has. In a way,” Sam said. “She said next year, maybe. Listen. Mom cannot deal with the round-the-clock caregivers. And believe me that she does not, does <em>not</em>, want to move in with Diana and me.”</p><p>•</p><p>Bridget phoned Sam. “So, what’s this place you want to move Lotte into?”</p><p>“Called Three Trees. It’s in the Hudson Valley,” Sam told her. “My brother will help me move Mom in, and move the stuff she’s fond of—the famous velvet sofa.”</p><p>“And she will have an apartment of her own?”</p><p>“A bedsitter, neat and convenient, with her own bathroom and a breakfast nook.”</p><p>“Her own nook,” Bridget said. “What’s outside the window?”</p><p>“The Hudson River view, unfortunately, is on the other side of the building. Trees. There’s a little parking lot and lots of green. Listen. We know Mom would prefer Manhattan—which would have been a hell of a lot more convenient for Diana and me to visit her—but who can afford something nice in the city?”</p><p>Bridget said, “It’s that none of us drives these days. How are we going to visit?”</p><p>“One of the advantages is that there will always be people around.”</p><p>“Does Lotte think this is an advantage?”</p><p>Sam said, “I have never been in a situation where there hasn’t been somebody to talk with.”</p><p>“I have,” said Bridget.</p><p>“And I would know she’s getting three proper meals.”</p><p>God. Poor Lotte, thought Bridget. And poor Sam. “You’re not a happy camper,” she said to him, wondering what the phrase came from.</p><p>•</p><p>Ruth, an old activist, had an idea. She said, “I’ll talk to Sam.”</p><p>“Have you closed on the Hudson Valley place?” she asked him.</p><p>“Greg and I are going up on Thursday.”</p><p>Ruth said, “Will you give us a couple of days to figure something out?”</p><p>“Believe me, there is nothing to . . . Yes, sure. O.K. But I need to get Mom and her stuff moved before Greg leaves for Chicago.”</p><p>Ruth said, “Could Lotte live alone if—”</p><p>“Absolutely not.”</p><p>“Sam, wait. Could Lotte live alone if the four of us—the three of us if Bessie can’t come in—take turns checking on Lotte, to see what she needs and if anything is wrong?”</p><p>“Mom would put sugar on her bread and butter.”</p><p>“Sounds delicious,” Ruth said.</p><p>“She would never change her clothes.”</p><p>“Probably not.”</p><p>“She would have one shower a week. She would not shower.”</p><p>“Sam! So what!”</p><p>“Not on my watch,” Sam said. “Things need to be done right.”</p><p>“No, they don’t. Why do they need to be right?”</p><p>“When Mom messed up her medicines, Greg and I had to rush her to Emergency. She might have died.”</p><p>“Yes. She might. Your mother might have died in her own bed, in sight of the Empire State Building and the George Washington Bridge. No, but Sam, we will go up and check on her. Let’s try it—a couple of days.”</p><p>“What if she falls down again?”</p><p>“She falls down. Sam, I’ll sleep over there tonight.”</p><p>Ruth slept over at Lotte’s, and Lotte fell going from her bed to the bathroom. Ruth called Sam, and Sam and Gregor came and took Lotte to Emergency.</p><p>•</p><p>Samson and Gregor moved their mother, the sofa, and whatever else out of Lotte’s ample apartment could be made to fit, into the bedsitter in the Hudson Valley. Greg flew back to Chicago.</p><p>•</p><p>When the ladies’ lunch met in Farah’s apartment, the agenda was Lotte’s rescue. Farah had a plan.</p><p>They brought each other up to date.</p><p>Lotte had phoned Ruth from Three Trees. Ruth said, “I didn’t recognize her voice. I mean, I knew that it was Lotte, but her voice sounded different, strangled, a new, strange voice.”</p><p>“Lotte is furious,” Bessie said.</p><p>“Yes, I know that voice,” Bridget said. “Lotte called me. She remembered my sitting with her and Shareen. She wanted me to get Shareen’s phone number. Shareen drives a car. Lotte wants Shareen to come and pick her up at Three Trees and drive her home to the apartment. Which is not going to happen.”</p><p>“Lotte called me,” reported Farah. “She wants us—her and me—to rent a car together. I told her I haven’t renewed my license. I doubt if I could pass the eye test. Not a problem, Lotte said. She would drive.”</p><p>“Does she even have a license?”</p><p>“Lotte hasn’t driven in ten years.”</p><p>Bessie said,<span data-page="page_final"></span> “Sam called me and he was fit to be tied. Wanted to know if I had something to do with Lotte buying a car. Buying a car! Me? I have never actually bought a car in my life. Lotte believes that she has bought a car and keeps calling this dealer to send her the keys.”</p><p>Bessie had called Lotte and asked her, “What’s this about a car?” Lotte said, “It’s down there in the parking lot.” “What kind of a car is this?” Bessie had asked her, and Lotte said, “I’m waiting till they send me the virtual key.”</p><p>•</p><p>Farah’s plan: Farah had an eighteen-year-old grandson, Hami. He would have his license as soon as he passed his test. “He’ll drive us to Three Trees, and we will bring Lotte back.”</p><p>“Better be soon,” Bessie said. “Sam is putting Lotte’s apartment on the market.”</p><p>“The test is this Monday.”</p><p>But Hami failed his test.</p><p>•</p><p>Bridget phoned Lotte at Three Trees. “How’s it going?”</p><p>“Not good.”</p><p>“How is the food?”</p><p>“Salt free.”</p><p>“Judging from your voice, you’re getting a little bit used to being there?”</p><p>“Can you come and get me and take me back to my apartment?”</p><p>“Lotte, we just really wouldn’t know how. For the moment, might it be a good idea to accommodate yourself?”</p><p>“Yes. But I need to go home,” Lotte said.</p><p>“Have you found anyone to talk to?”</p><p>“Yes. Alana. She sits next to me in the dining room. Alana has three children and five grandchildren, the oldest nineteen, the twins age thirteen, and a nine- and a five-year-old. Would you like me to tell you what their names are?”</p><p>“Not really.”</p><p>“Would you like me to tell you where each of them goes to school?”</p><p>“Lotte . . . ”</p><p>“Minnie Mansfield has a grandson. His name is Joel, and Joel has a friend whose name is Sam, like my Sam. Shall I tell you which colleges Sam and which colleges Joel are considering going to?”</p><p>“Lotte . . . ”</p><p>“Minnie’s sister’s granddaughter,” said Lotte, “is thinking of taking a gap year before she goes to Williams.”</p><p>“<em>Lotte</em> . . . ”</p><p>Lotte said, “I have not told Alana or Minnie that I’ve died. I thought awhile before telling Sam, but he was fine. He was really very good about it, my poor Sam.”</p><p>“You mean that you feel as if . . . ” Bridget hesitated between saying “as if you have died” and “as if you are dead.”</p><p>Lotte said, “No. I <em>am</em> dead. If I saw Dr. Goodman—or any doctor—he would look down my throat and see the four yellow spots dead people have. When you write the story, the question is whether, now that I am dead, I can die again, a second time, or is this what it is from here on.”</p><p>“Lotte, you want me to write your story?”</p><p>“You’ve already written how I got rid of Sarah and Shareen, and the roach in Shareen’s five-year-old’s mouth, and about Sam and Greg putting me here in the boonies.”</p><p>“Lotte,” Bridget said, “we’re mobilizing ourselves. We’re trying to figure out how to come and visit you.”</p><p>“Good! Oh, oh, good, good!” Lotte said. She wanted them to give her enough lead time so she could arrange a ladies’ lunch in the Three Trees dining room. “Then I’ll tell you how I lay down on my sofa—this was last Friday—just to take a nap, and when I woke up I knew that I was going to die, and I died.”</p><p>•</p><p>Sam has taken time off twice this month to go and visit his mother. He feels that she is settling in. “When she says that she has died she means died to the old New York life in order to pass into the new life at Three Trees.”</p><p>“That’s what you think she means?” Bessie asks him.</p><p>“What else could she mean?”</p><p>Bessie is silent a moment. She says, “Lotte has stopped calling me.”</p><p>“I know,” Sam says. “She doesn’t call me, and she doesn’t return Diana’s calls.”</p><p>“She doesn’t pick up her phone.”</p><p>“I know,” Sam says.</p><p>•</p><p>Bessie is pretty much stuck in Old Rockingham. Colin seems to be on the decline. Poor Bridget didn’t make it to the last ladies’ lunch, because she had one of her frequent debilitating headaches, but she wants to come along if Ruth and Farah figure out how to go and visit Lotte.</p><p>The idea to hitch a ride with Sam when he drives up to Three Trees gets screwed up because Lotte does not return Farah’s call. “And then I guess I forgot to call her,” Ruth says. “In any case, there wouldn’t have really been time to change my doctor’s appointment.”</p><p>•</p><p>Hami has got his license and has driven his new secondhand car to his first semester at Purchase.</p><p>•</p><p>Farah and Bridget still mean to figure out some way to go up and see Lotte, maybe in the spring, when the weather is nicer. ♦</p>	Lore Segal	February 27, 2017 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/02/27/ladies-lunch-lore-segal	Aging	Death	Friendships				Lotte	Third	Death
Last Night	<p>Walter <span data-page="page_1"></span>Such was a translator. He liked to write with a green fountain pen that he had a habit of raising in the air slightly after each sentence, almost as if his hand were a mechanical device. He could recite lines of Blok in Russian and then give Rilke’s translation of them in German, pointing out their beauty. He was a sociable but also sometimes prickly man, who stuttered a little at first and who lived with his wife in a manner they liked. But Marit, his wife, was ill.</p><p>He was sitting with Susanna, a family friend. Finally, they heard Marit on the stairs, and she came into the room. She was wearing a red silk dress in which she had always been seductive, with her loose breasts and sleek, dark hair. In the white wire baskets in her closet were stacks of folded clothes, underwear, sport things, nightgowns, the shoes jumbled beneath on the floor. Things she would never again need. Also jewelry, bracelets and necklaces, and a lacquer box with all her rings. She had looked through the lacquer box at length and picked several. She didn’t want her fingers, bony now, to be naked.</p><p>—You look re-really nice, her husband said.</p><p>—I feel as if it’s my first date or something. Are you having a drink?</p><p>—Yes.</p><p>—I think I’ll have one. Lots of ice, she said.</p><p>She sat down.</p><p>—I have no energy, she said, that’s the most terrible part. It’s gone. It doesn’t come back. I don’t even like to get up and walk around.</p><p>—It must be very difficult, Susanna said.</p><p>—You have no idea.</p><p>Walter came back with the drink and handed it to his wife.</p><p>—Well, happy days, she said. Then, as if suddenly remembering, she smiled at them. A frightening smile. It seemed to mean just the opposite.</p><p>It was the night they had decided would be the one. On a saucer in the refrigerator, the syringe lay. Her doctor had supplied the contents. But a farewell dinner first, if she were able. It should not be just the two of them, Marit had said. Her instinct. They had asked Susanna rather than someone closer and grief-filled, Marit’s sister, for example, with whom she was not on good terms, anyway, or older friends. Susanna was younger. She had a wide face and high, pure forehead. She looked like the daughter of a professor or banker, slightly errant. Dirty girl, one of their friends had commented about her, with a degree of admiration.</p><p>Susanna, sitting in a short skirt, was already a little nervous. It was hard to pretend it would be just an ordinary dinner. It would be hard to be offhanded and herself. She had come as dusk was falling. The house with its lighted windows—every room seemed to be lit—had stood out from all the others like a place in which something festive was happening.</p><p>Marit gazed at things in the room, the photographs with their silver frames, the lamps, the large books on Surrealism, landscape design, or country houses that she had always meant to sit down with and read, the chairs, even the rug with its beautiful faded color. She looked at it all as if she were somehow noting it, when in fact it all meant nothing. Susanna’s long hair and freshness meant something, though she was not sure what.</p><p>Certain memories are what you long to take with you, she thought, memories before Walter, from when she was a girl. Home, not this one but the original one with her childhood bed, the window on the landing out of which she had watched the swirling storms of long-ago winters, her father bending over her to say good night, the lamplight in which her mother was holding out a wrist, trying to fasten a bracelet.</p><p>That home. The rest was less dense. The rest was a long novel so like your life; you were going through it without thinking and then one morning it ended: there were bloodstains.</p><p>—I’ve had a lot of these, Marit reflected.</p><p>—The drink? Susanna asked.</p><p>—Yes.</p><p>—Over the years, you mean.</p><p>—Yes, over the years. What time is it getting to be?</p><p>—Quarter to eight, her husband said.</p><p>—Shall we go?</p><p>—Whenever you like, he said. No need to hurry.</p><p>—I don’t want to hurry.</p><p>She had, in fact, little desire to go. It was one step closer.</p><p>—What time is the reservation? she asked.</p><p>—Any time we like.</p><p>—Let’s go, then.</p><p>It was in the uterus and had travelled from there to the lungs. In the end, she had accepted it. Above the square neckline of her dress the skin, pallid, seemed to emanate a darkness. She no longer resembled herself. What she had been was gone; it had been taken from her. The change was fearful, especially in her face. She had a face now that was for the afterlife and those she would meet there. It was hard for Walter to remember how she had once been. She was almost a different woman from the one to whom he had made a solemn promise to help when the time came.</p><p>Susanna sat in the back as they drove. The roads were empty. They passed houses showing a shifting, bluish light downstairs. Marit sat silent. She felt sadness but also a kind of confusion. She was trying<span data-page="page_2"></span> to imagine all of it tomorrow, without her being here to see it. She could not imagine it. It was difficult to think the world would still be there.</p><p>At the hotel, they waited near the bar, which was noisy. Men without jackets, girls talking or laughing loudly, girls who knew nothing. On the walls were large French posters, old lithographs, in darkened frames.</p><p>—I don’t recognize anyone, Marit commented. Luckily, she added.</p><p>Walter had seen a talkative couple they knew, the Apthalls.</p><p>—Don’t look, he said. They haven’t seen us. I’ll get a table in the other room.</p><p>—Did they see us? Marit asked as they were seated. I don’t feel like talking to anyone.</p><p>—We’re all right, he said.</p><p>The waiter was wearing a white apron and black bow tie. He handed them the menu and a wine list.</p><p>—Can I get you something to drink?</p><p>—Yes, definitely, Walter said. He was looking at the list, on which the prices were in roughly ascending order. There was a Cheval-Blanc for five hundred and seventy-five dollars. This Cheval-Blanc, do you have this?</p><p>—The 1989? the waiter asked.</p><p>—Bring us a bottle of that.</p><p>—What is Cheval-Blanc? Is it a white? Susanna asked when the waiter had gone.</p><p>—No, it’s a red, Walter said.</p><p>—You know, it was very nice of you to join us tonight, Marit said to Susanna. It’s quite a special evening.</p><p>—Yes.</p><p>—We don’t usually order wine this good, she explained.</p><p>The two of them had often eaten here, usually near the bar, with its gleaming rows of bottles. They had never ordered wine that cost more than thirty-five dollars.</p><p>How was she feeling, Walter asked while they waited. Was she feeling O.K.?</p><p>—I don’t know how to express how I’m feeling. I’m taking morphine, Marit told Susanna. It’s doing the job, but . . . she stopped. There are a lot of things that shouldn’t happen to you, she said.</p><p>Dinner was quiet. It was difficult to talk casually. They had two bottles of the wine, however. He would never drink this well again, Walter could not help thinking. He poured the last of the second bottle into Susanna’s glass.</p><p>—No, you should drink it, she said. It’s really for you.</p><p>—He’s had enough, Marit said. It was good, though, wasn’t it?</p><p>—Fabulously good.</p><p>—Makes you realize there are things . . . oh, I don’t know, various things. It would be nice to have always drunk it. She said it in a way that was enormously touching.</p><p>They were all feeling better. They sat for a while and finally made their way out. The bar was still noisy.</p><p>Marit stared out the window as they drove. She was tired. They were going home now. The wind was moving in the tops of the shadowy trees. In the night sky there were brilliant blue clouds, shining as if in daylight.</p><p>—It’s very beautiful tonight, isn’t it? Marit said. I’m struck by that. Am I mistaken?</p><p>—No. Walter cleared his throat. It is beautiful.</p><p>—Have you noticed it? she asked Susanna. I’m sure you have. How old are you? I forget.</p><p>—Twenty-nine.</p><p>—Twenty-nine, Marit said. She was silent for a few moments. We never had children, she said. Do you wish you had children?</p><p>—Oh, sometimes, I suppose. I haven’t thought about it too much. It’s one of those things you have to be married to really think about.</p><p>—You’ll be married.</p><p>—Yes, perhaps.</p><p>—You could be married in a minute, Marit said.</p><p>She was tired when they reached the house. They sat together in the living room as if they had come from a big party but were not quite ready for bed. Walter was thinking of what lay ahead, the light that would come on in the refrigerator when the door was opened. The needle of the syringe was sharp, the stainless-steel point cut at an angle and like a razor. He was going to have to insert it into her vein. He tried not to dwell on it. He would manage somehow. He was becoming more and more nervous.</p><p>—I remember my mother, Marit said. She wanted to tell me things at the end, things that had happened when I was young. Rae Mahin had gone to bed with Teddy Hudner. Anne Herring had, too. They were married women. Teddy Hudner wasn’t married. He worked in advertising and was always playing golf. My mother went on like that, who slept with whom. That’s what she wanted to tell me, finally. Of course, at the time, Rae Mahin was really something.</p><p>Then Marit said, I think I’ll go upstairs.</p><p>She stood up. I’m all right, she told her husband. Don’t come up just yet. Good night, Susanna.</p><p>When there were just the two of them, Susanna said, I have to go.</p><p>—No, don’t. Please don’t go. Stay here.</p><p>She shook her head. I can’t, she said.</p><p>—Please, you have to. I’m going to go upstairs in a little while, but when I come down I can’t be alone. Please.</p><p>There was silence.</p><p>—Susanna.</p><p>They sat without speaking.</p><p>—I know you’ve thought all this out, she said.</p><p>—Yes, absolutely.</p><p>After a few minutes, Walter looked at his watch; he began to say something but then did not. A little later, he looked at it again, then left the room.</p><p>The kitchen was in the shape<span data-page="page_3"></span> of an L, old-fashioned and unplanned, with a white enamel sink and wooden cabinets painted many times. In the summers they had made preserves here when boxes of strawberries were sold at the stairway going down to the train platform in the city, unforgettable strawberries, their fragrance like perfume. There were still some jars. He went to the refrigerator and opened the door.</p><p>There it was, the small etched lines on the side. There were ten ccs. He tried to think of a way not to go on. If he dropped the syringe, broke it somehow, and said his hand had been shaking . . .</p><p>He took the saucer and covered it with a dish towel. It was worse that way. He put it down and picked up the syringe, holding it in various ways—finally, almost concealed against his leg. He felt light as a sheet of paper, devoid of strength.</p><p>Marit had prepared herself. She had made up her eyes and put on an ivory satin nightgown, low in back. It was the gown she would be wearing in the next world. She had made an effort to believe in an afterworld. The crossing was by boat, something the ancients knew with certainty. Over her collarbones lay strands of a silver necklace. She was weary. The wine had had an effect, but she was not calm.</p><p>In the doorway, Walter stood, as if waiting for permission. She looked at him without speaking. He had it in his hand, she saw. Her heart skidded nervously, but she was determined not to show it.</p><p>—Well, darling, she said.</p><p>He tried to reply. She had on fresh lipstick, he saw; her mouth looked dark. There were some photographs she had arranged around her on the bed.</p><p>—Come in.</p><p>—No, I’ll be back, he managed to say.</p><p>He hurried downstairs. He was going to fail; he had to have a drink. The living room was empty. Susanna had gone. He had never felt more completely alone. He went into the kitchen and poured some vodka, odorless and clear, into a glass and quickly drank it. He went slowly upstairs again and sat on the bed near his wife. The vodka was making him drunk. He felt unlike himself.</p><p>—Walter, she said.</p><p>—Yes?</p><p>—This is the right thing.</p><p>She reached to take his hand. Somehow it frightened him, as if it might mean an appeal to come with her.</p><p>—You know, she said evenly, I’ve loved you as much as I’ve ever loved anyone in the world—I’m sounding maudlin, I know.</p><p>—Ah, Marit! he cried.</p><p>—Did you love me?</p><p>His stomach was churning in despair.</p><p>—Yes, he said. Yes!</p><p>—Take care of yourself.</p><p>—Yes.</p><p>He was in good health, as it happened, a little heavier than he might have been, but nevertheless . . . His roundish, scholarly stomach was covered with a layer of soft, dark hair, his hands and nails well cared for.</p><p>She leaned forward and embraced him. She kissed him. For a moment, she was not afraid. She would live again, be young again as she once had been. She held out her arm. On the inside, two veins the color of verdigris were visible. He began to press to make them rise. Her head was turned away.</p><p>—Do you remember, she said to him, when I was working at Bates and we met that first time? I knew right away.</p><p>The needle was wavering as he tried to position it.</p><p>—I was lucky, she said. I was very lucky.</p><p>He was barely breathing. He waited, but she did not say anything more. Hardly believing what he was doing, he pushed the needle in—it was effortless—and slowly injected the contents. He heard her sigh. Her eyes were closed as she lay back. Her face was peaceful. She had embarked. My God, he thought, my God. He had known her when she was in her twenties, long-legged and innocent. Now he had slipped her, as in a burial at sea, beneath the flow of time. Her hand was still warm. He took it and held it to his lips. He pulled the bedspread up to cover her legs. The house was incredibly quiet. It had fallen into silence, the silence of a fatal act. He could not hear the wind.</p><p>He went slowly downstairs. A sense of relief came over him, enormous relief and sadness. Outside, the monumental blue clouds filled the night. He stood for a few minutes and then saw, sitting in her car, motionless, Susanna. She rolled down the window as he approached.</p><p>—You didn’t go, he said.</p><p>—I couldn’t stay in there.</p><p>—It’s over, he said. Come in. I’m going to get a drink.</p><p>She stood in the kitchen with him, her arms folded, a hand on each elbow.</p><p>—It wasn’t terrible, he said. It’s just that I feel . . . I don’t know.</p><p>They drank standing there.</p><p>—Did she really want me to come? Susanna said.</p><p>—Darling, <em>she</em> suggested it. She didn’t know a thing.</p><p>—I wonder.</p><p>—Believe me. Nothing.</p><p>She put down her drink.</p><p>—No, drink it, he said. It’ll help.</p><p>—I feel funny.</p><p>—Funny? You’re not feeling sick?</p><p>—I don’t know.</p><p>—Don’t be sick. Here, come with me. Wait, I’ll get you some water.</p><p>She was concentrating on breathing evenly.</p><p>—You’d better lie down for a bit, he said.</p><p>—No, I’m all<span data-page="page_final"></span> right.</p><p>—Come.</p><p>He led her, in her short skirt and blouse, to a room to one side of the front door and made her sit on the bed. She was taking slow breaths.</p><p>—Susanna.</p><p>—Yes.</p><p>—I need you.</p><p>She more or less heard him. Her head was thrown back like that of a woman longing for God.</p><p>—I shouldn’t have drunk so much, she murmured.</p><p>He began to unbutton her blouse.</p><p>—No, she said, trying to rebutton it.</p><p>He was unfastening her brassiere. Her gorgeous breasts emerged. He could not take his eyes from them. He kissed them passionately. She felt herself moved to the side as he pulled down the cover of the white sheets. She tried to speak again, but he put his hand over her mouth and pushed her down. He devoured her, shuddering as if in fright at the end and holding her to him tightly. They fell into a profound sleep.</p><p>In earliest morning, the light was clear and intensely bright. The house, standing in its path, became even whiter. It stood out from its neighbors, more pure and serene. The shadow of a tall elm beside it was traced on it as finely as if drawn by a pencil. The pale curtains hung unmoving. Nothing stirred within. In back was the wide lawn across which Susanna had been idly strolling as part of a garden tour on the day he had first seen her, shapely and tall. It was a vision he had not been able to erase, though the rest had started later, when she came to redo the garden with Marit.</p><p>They sat at the table drinking coffee. They were complicit, not long risen, and not regarding one another too closely. Walter was admiring her, however. Without makeup she was even more appealing. Her long hair was not combed. She seemed very approachable. There were calls that would have to be made, but he was not thinking of them. It was still too early. He was thinking past this day. Mornings to come. At first he hardly heard the sound behind him. It was a footstep and then, slowly, another—Susanna turned white—as Marit came unsteadily down the stairs. The makeup on her face was stale, and her dark lipstick showed fissures. He stared in disbelief.</p><p>—Something went wrong, she said.</p><p>—Are you all right? he asked foolishly.</p><p>—No, you must have done it wrong.</p><p>—Oh, God, Walter murmured.</p><p>She sat weakly on the bottom step. She did not seem to notice Susanna.</p><p>—I thought you were going to help me, she said, and began to cry.</p><p>—I can’t understand it, he said.</p><p>—It’s all wrong, Marit was repeating. Then, to Susanna, You’re still here?</p><p>—I was just leaving, Susanna said.</p><p>—I don’t understand, Walter said again.</p><p>—I have to do it all over, Marit sobbed.</p><p>—I’m sorry, he said. I’m so sorry.</p><p>He could think of nothing more to say. Susanna had gone to get her clothes. She left by the front door.</p><p>That was how she and Walter came to part, upon being discovered by his wife. They met two or three times afterward, at his insistence, but to no avail. Whatever holds people together was gone. She told him she could not help it. That was just the way it was. ♦</p>	James Salter	November 18, 2002 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/11/18/last-night-2	Cancer	Death	Husbands	Love Affairs	Restaurants	Sex	Walter Such	Third	Death
Long Ago Yesterday	<p>One <span data-page="page_1"></span>evening just after my fiftieth birthday, I pushed against the door of a pub not far from my childhood home. My father, on the way back from his office in London, was inside, standing at the bar. He didn’t recognize me, but I was delighted, almost ecstatic, to see the old man again, particularly as he’d been dead for ten years, and my mother for five.</p><p>“Good evening,” I said, standing next to him. “Nice to see you.”</p><p>“Good evening,” he replied.</p><p>“This place never changes,” I said.</p><p>“We like it this way,” he said.</p><p>I ordered a drink; I needed one.</p><p>I noticed the date on a discarded newspaper and calculated that Dad was just a little older than me, nearly fifty-one. We were as close to equals—or contemporaries—as we’d ever be.</p><p>He was talking to a man sitting on a stool next to him, and the barmaid was laughing extravagantly with them both. I knew Dad better than anyone, or thought I did, and I was tempted to embrace him or at least kiss his hands, as I used to. I refrained, but watched him looking comfortable at the bar beside the man I now realized was the father of a school friend of mine. Neither of them seemed to mind when I joined in.</p><p>Like a lot of people, I have some of my best friendships with the dead. I dream frequently about both of my parents and the house where I grew up, undistinguished though it was. Of course, I never imagined that Dad and I might meet up like this, for a conversation.</p><p>Lately I had been feeling unusually foreign to myself. My fiftieth hit me like a tragedy, with a sense of wasted purpose and many wrong moves made. I could hardly complain: I was a theatre and film producer, with houses in London, New York, and Brazil. But complain I did. I had become keenly aware of various mental problems that enervated but did not ruin me.</p><p>I ran into Dad on a Monday. Over the weekend I’d been staying with some friends in the country who had a fine house and pretty acquaintances, good paintings to look at, and an excellent cook. The Iraq war, which had just started, had been on TV continuously. About twenty of us, old and young men, lay on deep sofas drinking champagne and giggling until the prospect of thousands of bombs smashing into donkey carts, human flesh, and primitive shacks had depressed everyone in the house. We were aware that disgust was general in the country and that Tony Blair, once our hope after years in opposition, had become the most tarnished and loathed leader since Anthony Eden. We were living in a time of lies, deceit, and alienation. This was heavy, and our lives seemed uncomfortably trivial in comparison.</p><p>Just after lunch, I had left my friend’s house, and the taxi got me as far as the railway station when I realized I’d left behind a bent paper clip I’d been fiddling with. It was in my friend’s library, where I’d been reading about mesmerism in the work of Maupassant, as well as Dickens’s experiments with hypnotism, which had got him into a lot of trouble with the wife of a friend. The taxi took me back, and I hurried into the room to retrieve the paper clip, but the cleaner had just finished. Did I want to examine the contents of the vacuum? my hosts asked. They were making faces at one another. Yet I had begun to see myself as heroic in terms of what I’d achieved in spite of my obsessions. This was a line my therapist used. Luckily, I would be seeing the good doctor the next day.</p><p>Despite my devastation over the paper clip, I returned to the station and got on the train. I had come down by car, so it was only now I realized that the route of the train meant we would stop at the suburban railway station nearest to my childhood home. As we drew into the platform, I found myself straining to see things I recognized, even familiar faces, though I had left the area some thirty years before. But it was raining hard and almost impossible to make anything out. Then, just as the train was about to pull away, I grabbed my bag and got off, walking out into the street with no idea what I would do.</p><p>Near the station there had been a small record shop, a bookshop, and a place to buy jeans, along with several pubs that I’d been taken to as a young man by a local bed-sit aesthete, the first person I came out to. Of course, he knew straight away. His hero was Jean Cocteau. We’d discuss French literature and Wilde and Pop, before taking our speed pills and applying our makeup in the station toilet and getting the train into the city. Along with another white friend who dressed as Jimi Hendrix, we saw all the plays and shows. Eventually I got a job in a West End box office. This led to work as a stagehand, usher, dresser—even a director—before I found my “vocation” as a producer.</p><p>Now I asked my father his name and what he did. I knew how to work Dad, of course. Soon he was more<span data-page="page_2"></span> interested in me than in the other man. Yet my fear didn’t diminish: didn’t we look similar? I wasn’t sure. My clothes, as well as my sparkly new teeth, were more expensive than his, and I was heavier and taller, about a third bigger all over—I have always worked out. But my hair was going gray; I don’t dye it. Dad’s hair was still mostly black.</p><p>An accountant all his life, my father had worked in the same office for fifteen years. He was telling me that he had two sons: Dennis, who was in the Air Force, and me—Billy. A few months ago I’d gone away to university, where, apparently, I was doing well. My all-female production of “Waiting for Godot”—“a bloody depressing play,” according to Dad—had been admired. I wanted to say, “But I didn’t direct it, Dad, I only produced it.”</p><p>I had introduced myself to Dad as Peter, the name I sometimes adopted, along with quite a developed alternative character, during anonymous sexual encounters. Not that I needed a persona: Father would ask me where I was from and what I did, but whenever I began to answer he’d interrupt with a stream of advice and opinions.</p><p>My father said he wanted to sit down because his sciatica was playing up, and I joined him at a table. Eying the barmaid, Dad said, “She’s lovely, isn’t she?”</p><p>“Lovely hair,” I said. “Unfortunately, none of her clothes fit.”</p><p>“Who’s interested in her clothes?”</p><p>This was an aspect of my father I’d never seen; perhaps it was a departure for him. I’d never known him to go to the pub after work; he came straight home. And once Dennis had left I was able to secure Father’s evenings for myself. Every day I’d wait for him at the bus stop, ready to take his briefcase. In the house I’d make him a cup of tea while he changed.</p><p>Now the barmaid came over to remove our glasses and empty the ashtrays. As she leaned across the table, Dad put his hand behind her knee and slid it all the way up her skirt to her arse, which he caressed, squeezed, and held until she reeled away and stared at him in disbelief, shouting that she hated the pub and the men in it, and would he get out before she called the landlord and he flung him out personally?</p><p>The landlord did indeed rush over. He snatched away Dad’s glass, raising his fist as Dad hurried to the door, forgetting his briefcase. I’d never known Dad to go to work without his briefcase, and I’d never known him to leave it anywhere. As my brother and I used to say, his attaché case was always attached to him. Outside, where Dad was brushing himself down, I handed it back to him.</p><p>“Thank you,” he said. “Shouldn’t have done that. But once, just once, I had to. Suppose it’s the last time I touch anyone!” He asked, “Which way are you going?”</p><p>“I’ll walk with you a bit,” I said. “My bag isn’t heavy. I’m passing through. I need to get a train into London, but there’s no hurry.”</p><p>He said, “Why don’t you come and have a drink at my house?”</p><p>My parents lived according to a strict regime, mathematical in its exactitude. Why, now, was he inviting a stranger to his house? I had always been his only friend; our involvement had kept us both busy.</p><p>“Are you sure?”</p><p>“Yes,” he said. “Come.”</p><p>Noise and night and rain streaming everywhere: you couldn’t see farther than your hand. But we both knew the way, Dad moving slowly, his mouth hanging open to catch more air. He seemed happy enough, perhaps with what he’d done in the pub, or maybe my company cheered him up.</p><p>Yet when we turned the corner into the neat familiar road, a road that had, to my surprise, remained exactly where it was all the time I hadn’t been there, I felt wrapped in coldness. In my recent dreams—fading as they were like frescoes in the light—the suburban street had been darkly dismal under the yellow shadows of the streetlights, and filled with white flowers and a suffocating, deathly odor, like being buried in roses. But how could I falter now? Once inside the house, Dad threw open the door to the living room. I blinked; there she was, Mother, knitting in her huge chair with her feet up, an open box of chocolates on the small table beside her, her fingers rustling for treasure in the crinkly paper.</p><p>Dad left me while he changed into his pajamas and dressing gown. The fact that he had a visitor, a stranger, didn’t deter him from his routine, outside of which there were no maps.</p><p>I stood in my usual position, justbehind Mother’s chair. Here, where I wouldn’t impede her enjoyment with noise, complaints, or the sight of my face, I explained that Dad and I had met in the pub and he’d invited me back for a drink.</p><p>Mother said, “I don’t think we’ve got any drink, unless there’s something left over from last Christmas. Drink doesn’t go bad, does it?”</p><p>“It doesn’t go bad.”</p><p>“Now shut up,” she said. “I’m watching this. D’you watch the soaps?”</p><p>“Not much.”</p><p>Maybe the ominous whiteness of my dreams had been stimulated by the whiteness of the<span data-page="page_3"></span> things Mother had been knitting and crocheting—headrests, gloves, cushion covers; there wasn’t a piece of furniture in the house without a knitted thing on it. Even as a grown man, I couldn’t buy a pair of gloves without thinking I should be wearing Mother’s.</p><p>In the kitchen, I made a cup of tea for myself and Dad. Mum had left my father’s dinner in the oven: sausages, mash, and peas, all dry as lime by now, and presented on a large cracked plate, with space between each item. Mum had asked me if I wanted anything, but how would I have been able to eat anything here?</p><p>As I waited for the kettle to boil, I washed up the dishes at the sink overlooking the garden. Then I carried Father’s tea and dinner into his study, formerly the family dining room. With one hand I made a gap for the plate at the table, which was piled high with library books.</p><p>After I’d finished my homework, Dad always liked me to go through the radio schedules, marking programs I might record for him. If I was lucky, he would read to me, or talk about the lives of the artists he was absorbed with—these were his companions. Their lives were exemplary, but only a fool would try to emulate them. Meanwhile I would slip my hand inside his pajama top and tickle his back, or I’d scratch his head or rub his arms until his eyes rolled in appreciation.</p><p>Now in his bedwear, sitting down to eat, Dad told me he was embarked on a “five-year reading plan.” He was working on “War and Peace.” Next it would be “Remembrance of Things Past,” then “Middlemarch,” all of Dickens, Homer, Chaucer, and so on. He kept a separate notebook for each author he read.</p><p>“This methodical way,” he pointed out, “you get to know everything in literature. You will never run out of interest, of course, because then there is music, painting, in fact the whole of human history. . . .”</p><p>His talk reminded me of the time I won the school essay prize for a tract on time-wasting. The piece was not about how to fritter away one’s time profitlessly, which might have made it a useful and lively work, but about how much can be achieved by filling every moment with activity! Dad was my ideal. He would read even in the bath, and as he reclined there my job was to wash his feet, back, and hair with soap and a flannel. When he was done, I’d be waiting with a warm, open towel.</p><p>I interrupted him, “You certainly wanted to know that woman this evening.”</p><p>“What? How quiet it is! Shall we hear some music?”</p><p>He was right. Neither the city nor the country was quiet like the suburbs, the silence of people holding their breath.</p><p>Dad was holding up a record he had borrowed from the library. “You will know this, but not well enough, I guarantee you.”</p><p>Beethoven’s Fifth was an odd choice of background music, but how could I sneer? Without his enthusiasm, my life would never have been filled with music. Mother had been a church pianist, and she’d taken us to the ballet, usually “The Nutcracker,” or the Bolshoi when they visited London. Mum and Dad sometimes went ballroom dancing; I loved it when they dressed up. Out of such minute inspirations I have found meaning sufficient for a life.</p><p>Dad said, “Do you think I’ll be able to go in that pub again?”</p><p>“If you apologize.”</p><p>“Better leave it a few weeks. I don’t know what overcame me. That woman’s not a Jewess, is she?”</p><p>“I don’t know.”</p><p>“Usually she’s happy to hear about my aches and pains, and who else is, at our age?”</p><p>“Where d’you ache?”</p><p>“It’s the walk to and from the station—sometimes I just can’t make it. I have to stop and lean against something.”</p><p>I said, “I’ve been learning massage.”</p><p>“Ah.” He put his feet in my lap. I squeezed his feet, ankles, and calves; he wasn’t looking at me now. He said, “Your hands are strong. You’re not a plumber, are you?”</p><p>“I’ve told you what I do. I have the theatre, and now I’m helping to set up a teaching foundation, a studio for the young.”</p><p>He whispered, “Are you homosexual?”</p><p>“I am, yes. Never seen a cock I didn’t like. You?”</p><p>“Queer? It would have shown up by now, wouldn’t it? But I’ve never done much about my female interests.”</p><p>“You’ve never been unfaithful?”</p><p>“I’ve always liked women.”</p><p>I asked, “Do they like you?”</p><p>“The local secretaries are friendly. Not that you can do anything. I can’t afford a ‘professional.’ ”</p><p>“How often do you go to the pub?”</p><p>“I’ve started popping in after work. My Billy has gone.”</p><p>“For good?”</p><p>“After university he’ll come running back to me, I can assure you of that. Around this time of night, I’d always be talking to him. There’s a lot you can put in a kid, without his knowing it. My wife doesn’t have a word to say to me. She doesn’t like to do anything for me, either.”</p><p>“Sexually?”</p><p>“She might look large to you, but in the flesh she is even larger, and she crushes me like a gnat in bed. I can honestly say we haven’t had it off for<span data-page="page_4"></span> eighteen years.”</p><p>“Since Billy was born?”</p><p>He said, letting me caress him, “She never had much enthusiasm for it. Now she is indifferent . . . frozen . . . almost dead.”</p><p>I said, “People are more scared of their own passion than of anything else. But it’s a grim deprivation she’s made you endure.”</p><p>He nodded. “You dirty homos have a good time, I bet, looking at one another in toilets and that—”</p><p>“People like to think so. But I’ve lived alone for five years.”</p><p>He said, “I am hoping she will die before me, then I might have a chance. . . . We ordinary types carry on in these hateful situations for the single reason of the children, and you’ll never have that.”</p><p>“You’re right.”</p><p>He indicated photographs of me and my brother. “Without those babies, there is nothing for me. It is ridiculous to try to live for yourself alone.”</p><p>“Don’t I know it? Unless one can find others to live for.”</p><p>“I hope you do!” he said. “But it can never be the same as your own.”</p><p>If the mortification of fidelity imperils love, there’s always the consolation of children. I had been Dad’s girl, his servant, his worshipper; my faith had kept him alive. It was a cult of personality he had set up, with my brother and me as his mirrors.</p><p>Now Mother opened the door—not so wide that she could see us, or us her—and announced that she was going to bed.</p><p>“Good night,” I called.</p><p>Dad was right about kids. But what could I do about it? I had bought an old factory at my own expense and had converted it into a theatre studio, a place where young people could work with established artists. I spent so much time in this building that I had moved my office there. It was where I would head when I left here, to sit in the café, seeing who would turn up and what they wanted from me, if anything. I was gradually divesting myself, as I aged, of all I’d accumulated. One of Father’s favorite works was Tolstoy’s “How Much Land Does a Man Need?”</p><p>I said, “With or without children, you are still a man. There are things you want that children cannot provide.”</p><p>He said, “We all, in this street, are devoted to hobbies.”</p><p>“The women, too?”</p><p>“They sew, or whatever. There’s never an idle moment. My son has written a beautiful essay on the use of time.”</p><p>He sipped his tea; the Beethoven, which was on repeat, boomed away. He seemed content to let me work on his legs. Since he didn’t want me to stop, I asked him to lie on the floor. With characteristic eagerness, he removed his dressing gown and then his pajama top; I massaged every part of him, murmuring “Dad, Dad” under my breath. When at last he stood up, I was ready with his warm dressing gown, which I had placed on the radiator.</p><p>It was late, but not too late to leave. It was never too late to leave the suburbs, but Dad invited me to stay. I agreed, though it hadn’t occurred to me that he would suggest I sleep in my old room, in my bed.</p><p>He accompanied me upstairs and in I went, stepping over record sleeves, magazines, clothes, books. My piano I was most glad to see. I can still play a little, but my passion was writing the songs that were scrawled in notebooks on top of the piano. Not that I would be able to look at them. When I began to work in the theatre, I didn’t show my songs to anyone, and eventually I came to believe they were a waste of time.</p><p>Standing there shivering, I had to tell myself the truth: my secret wasn’t that I hadn’t propagated but that I’d wanted to be an artist, not just a producer. If I chose, I could blame my parents for this: they had seen themselves as spectators, in the background of life. But I was the one who’d lacked the guts—to fail, to succeed, to engage with the whole undignified, insane attempt at originality. I had only ever been a handmaiden, first to Dad and then to others—the artists I’d supported—and how could I have imagined that that would be sufficient?</p><p>My bed was narrow. Through the thin ceiling, I could hear my father snoring; I knew whenever he turned over in bed. It was true that I had never heard them making love. Somehow, between them, they had transformed the notion of physical love into a ridiculous idea. Why would people want to do something so awkward with their limbs?</p><p>I couldn’t hear Mother. She didn’t snore, but she could sigh for England. I got up and went to the top of the stairs. By the kitchen light I could see her in her dressing gown, stockings around her ankles, trudging along the hall and into each room, wringing her hands as she went, muttering back to the ghosts clamoring within her skull.</p><p>She stood still to scratch and tear at her exploded arms. During the day, she kept them covered because of her “eczema.” Now I watched while flakes of skin fell onto the carpet, as though she were converting herself into dust. She dispersed the shreds of her body<span data-page="page_final"></span> with her delicately pointed dancer’s foot.</p><p>As a child—even as a young man—I would never have approached Mother in this state. She had always made it clear that the uproar and demands of two boys were too much for her. Naturally, she couldn’t wish for us to die, so she died herself, inside.</p><p>One time, my therapist asked whether Dad and I were able to be silent together. More relevant, I should have said, was whether Mother and I could be together without my chattering on about whatever occurred to me, in order to distract her from herself. Now I made up my mind and walked down the stairs, watching her all the while. She was like difficult music, and you wouldn’t want to get too close. But, as with such music, I wouldn’t advise trying to make it out—you have to sit with it, wait for it to address you.</p><p>I was standing beside her, and with her head down she looked at me sideways.</p><p>“I’ll make you some tea,” I said, and she even nodded.</p><p>Before, during one of her nighttime wanderings, she had found me masturbating in front of some late-night TV program. It must have been some boy group, or Bowie. “I know what you are,” she said. She was not disapproving. She was just a lost ally.</p><p>I made a cup of lemon tea and gave it to her. As she stood sipping it, I took up a position beside her, my head bent also, attempting to see—as she appeared to vibrate with inner electricity—what she saw and felt. It was clear that there was no chance of my ever being able to cure her. I could only become less afraid of her madness.</p><p>In his bed, Father was still snoring. He wouldn’t have liked me to be with her. He had taken her sons for himself, charmed them away, and he wasn’t a sharer.</p><p>She was almost through with the tea and getting impatient. Wandering, muttering, scratching: she had important work to do and time was passing. I couldn’t detain her anymore.</p><p>I slept in her chair in the front room.</p><p>When I got up, my parents were having breakfast. My father was back in his suit, and my mother was in the uniform she wore to work in the supermarket. I dressed rapidly in order to join Dad as he walked to the station. It had stopped raining.</p><p>I asked him about his day, but couldn’t stop thinking about mine. I was living, as my therapist enjoyed reminding me, under the aegis of the clock. I wanted to go to the studio and talk; I wanted to eat well and make love well, go to a show and then dance, and make love again. I could not be the same as them.</p><p>At the station in London, Father and I parted. I said I’d always look out for him when I was in the area, but couldn’t be sure when I’d be coming his way again. ♦</p>	Hanif Kureishi	March 8, 2004 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/03/08/long-ago-yesterday	Death	Fathers					Unnamed	First	Death
Madame Lazarus	<p>Many <span data-page="page_1"></span>years ago, after I retired from the bank, James brought a small terrier to our apartment in Paris. I told him I did not want it. I knew he was trying to keep me occupied, and it is a ridiculous thing, to have a dog. Maybe one day you rise from bed and say, “I would like to pick up five thousand pieces of shit.” Well, then, I have just the thing for you. And for a man to have a small dog—it makes you a fool.</p><p>“Please,” James said. “Let’s just see how it goes.”</p><p>I considered the dog, a blond female no bigger than a cat. She had long hair like whiskers over her eyes, so she seemed always to be raising her eyebrows. She sat down, as if she knew that would help her case. James is English and wanted to call her Cordelia, not for “Lear” but for an English novel. It was not the name I would have chosen, but it was not worth the argument. He did a ringmaster act with some toys—a knot of cloth, a ball, a round bed—to show me how good this would be. I had long associated terriers with the barking arts, but this one did not bark. She sniffed at the toys and the bed, waiting for my decision.</p><p>The next day James was gone to Brazil or Argentina, leaving me with the dog. He had an import business, and was often away. I think Cordelia had already guessed that he was not a sure thing, and she looked at me for our next move.</p><p>I took her outside to do her business. She was not allowed to go in the impasse, where the cars park and the concierge is always watching, so we went out through the gate to the street. We walked around Paris. We went to the Bois de Boulogne, and there a hawk circled, eying Cordelia like a snack.</p><p>“Don’t even think of it,” I told this hawk.</p><p>People spoke to me who would not have before, and they wanted to pet Cordelia, who let them. When we arrived home, Desi was there to make lunch, and she cried out and dropped to her knees to rub the ears of the dog. Desi is from Indonesia, very proper, and she had worked for me for many years, but I had never seen such a display. Cordelia licked her face in greeting, and Desi laughed. Then I sat to read the paper, and Cordelia curled herself into my lap.</p><p>At first I believed that the appearance of love from a dog is only a strategy, to win protection. Cordelia chose me because I was the one to feed her and to chase away the hawks and the wolves. But after a time we crossed over a line, Cordelia and I. We went out each day to chase the pigeons and smell the piss of other dogs on the trees, and we came home to read the paper. The look with the eyebrows was sometimes skeptical about my actions, and sometimes a question that I understood. There were no arguments except silent ones—<em>I do not want to go there on the leash</em>—and these could be easily solved. Her hair needed to be cut, so I found a woman to do it, who tied pink ribbons over Cordelia’s ears. She hated these ribbons. You could see she was ashamed. I told the groomer no more—she is too dignified for this. And, if she feels shame, then why not other emotions? A creature’s eyes are on you all the time, or the warm body is next to you. There is an understanding. And I think this becomes something like love.</p><p>I am older now than I thought possible. I did not believe I would ever be this ancient person. The doctor says I should have no wine at lunch, for my heart. But if you cannot have a little wine with your lunch, there is no life. If you are as old as I am, you believed a German would shoot you in the head before you were old enough to have sex with another human being. Everything beyond that becomes extra. The things people do to live long—drinking so much water, running up and down to ruin the knees—this is what the doctor should warn about.</p><p>James is young, far younger than I. When you are the older man, you can be equal, for a time. He has youth and beauty, but you have money and experience. You know many people, and you can take him to Portofino, to Biarritz, to Capri. It is an old story.</p><p>But the years go by, and your doctor is concerned for your heart. Your joints are not so good. You don’t want to look in the mirror when you go to take a bath. And the man you love is still strong and young, more or less. He travels a great deal. He is away more often. The dog knew the first time she saw him: he was not the one to rely on.</p><p>My ex-wife, Simone, comes for lunch sometimes, and we talk of our sons, who are long grown and have children of their own. One lives in New York and the other in Zurich—they are both in the banking. They know James, of course, but<span data-page="page_2"></span> they do not like him. There is no reason they would. They are serious men, and James is not. Their children, my grandchildren, are charmed by him. They consider James an uncle. He is the correct age, and he is willing to play with them in a way adults are not. And Simone accepts him, which is in some ways a remarkable thing.</p><p>Simone looks as she always did, although she says this is only because I never saw her, not really. But I do: she is an elegant woman, all angles, gold bracelets on thin, tan wrists. And she understands what it is to be old, which is a comfort. After she leaves, Desi clears away the lunch dishes, and I take Cordelia out for a walk.</p><p>There came a point when I realized that James was in Paris only when there was an important party. Every person has one great gift, and James is unequalled at an important party. He is good-looking, of course, with the well-cut brown hair and the trim body and the bespoke suit. He has a brilliant smile, very warm and interested and sincere, and when he talks to people they feel special. He has many other abilities, but this one above all. They want to do business with him because of this attention. He is never looking over the shoulder to see who else is at the party. Who he is talking to, this person gets everything.</p><p>But then we go home, and the attention goes off like a light. He does not give me the warm and interested smile. He says a thing or two about the party, in the French he speaks like an Englishman but very well. He looks at his phone, swiping with his thumb. He takes his expensive clothes off carelessly, leaves them on the furniture like a child. He has had money always, and good looks, and was his mother’s darling. He says Desi will pick up the clothes, although I tell him this is not her job. He says of course it is, what else is her job? He is careful only with his shoes. He puts them on wooden shoetrees in the closet, then goes into the bathroom and closes the door.</p><p>I think of the first boy I loved, two lifetimes ago. He came to my family’s house, and I ran inside from playing and saw him standing with his mother. He had a light behind his eyes and a crown of silken curls. He was like someone standing in the sun, even in the dim, cool room. I was still very young, and it was a shock, because it was the first time I knew who I was. He was older than I, and he understood also—I could see that.</p><p>Then came the war, and the people fleeing Paris, and the Germans in the city. I was sent to England to live with some cousins, and I did not know what happened to this boy. He stayed behind. When I discovered him again, in a night club after the war, he did not like to talk about those years. The beauty that could help him in another time was not so useful during the Occupation. The Germans would be happy to kill him, or to send him to build their bunkers, which would be the same, and I do not know how he escaped. He said he tried to help the Maquis, but the people he knew did not want him. He did not seem strong, or robust. He was not a saboteur. Perhaps he could get information, but they did not trust how he would do it.</p><p>He was arrested at the end of the war, when the Germans were in a panic, and they simply left him in prison with no food. When I saw him in the night club he had the <em>tuberculose</em> from this prison, but he was still extraordinarily handsome. He seemed very pitiful to me, and very desirable.</p><p>My older brother had his own flat then, to be independent, but I still lived in the family house. This boy came to visit me when my parents were away. I knew my father would not approve, but it was exciting. I remembered the way the boy had lit up the old carpets, the paintings, the dust floating in the air.</p><p>One night, the boy and I were eating dinner at one end of the long table in my family house—he was always hungry—when he began to cough. The sound was wet and terrible, and the coughing did not stop. There was blood on the napkin, and his face was purple around the eyes, and then something went very wrong. There was so much blood, and he was coughing, dying, there on the dining-room floor. I didn’t know what to do, how to stop this hemorrhage. I thought, He will open his eyes in a minute, he will smile, he will wipe his mouth and say, “No, no, do not worry. I am fine.” But it did not happen. I heard a roaring like the sea in my ears. My hands were shaking.</p><p>I telephoned the doctor and my brother, and they came. My brother was furious, concerned only with the scandal of this disreputable night-club boy dying in our family house. “You should have put him in a<span data-page="page_3"></span> bathtub,” he said. “For the blood.”</p><p>I stared at him. When was I to carry him upstairs? There would be blood everywhere if I did this.</p><p>The doctor was kinder, more practical. He asked if there would be semen on the body, or inside it. I was shocked by the question, but I said no. It was the truth. He said this would make it easier. He asked me to help carry the boy to his car, and I lifted the shoulders. The doctor took the legs. He weighed so little. The head dropped back—the pale face, the bruised eyes—and I could not look, I was filled with horror. The doctor took him away in his car to the morgue and said I was never to speak of it. <em>N’en parlons plus jamais.</em> And, you see, still I find I do not want to say his name.</p><p>The housekeeper would arrive in the morning, so my brother helped me clean. I moved very slowly, my arms and legs frozen, while my brother gave me orders. I ran cold water on the napkins and towels in the sink, for the blood. I knew I could never repay what the doctor had done. I also knew that my brother would now have the moral advantage over me for the rest of my life. That is what I thought with my hands in the cold pink water, feeling sorry for myself, when it was the boy I loved who was dead.</p><p>Within the year, I met Simone. She was very appropriate, with a good family, the most graceful lines in a dress. She was in every way correct, and I must have proposed, because there was an engagement, a great announcement. I had never seen my father so happy. My mother was not so sure, but we had no way of discussing this at that time. There was the momentum of the approaching wedding—it was like climbing into an enormous car without brakes. The party, all the people watching, the flowers and the caterers. In front of everyone I knew, I put my grandmother’s ring on Simone’s elegant hand and made promises that I could not keep.</p><p>Cordelia sleeps on our bed, in the wide gulf between James and me. But she is old now, like me, and she gets down and pees on the rug. I go for the bottle of Perrier, the towel. Then she pees in the hall. James is still asleep, so I clean the hall floor and leave the bottle there. I put on my clothes quietly, and I take the dog outside.</p><p>Cordelia starts to go in the impasse, which she knows is not allowed. The concierge will come out, the neighbors will complain, it will be a whole issue. I speak to Cordelia, I pull on her leash, but she does not want to move. I pull harder. Finally she follows, very slowly. I could pick her up, but she needs to walk, just a little. This is the important thing, not to stop moving.</p><p>On the pavement outside the gate, she stands and seems to think about something far away. Her eyes are cloudy. She does not do a shit. She makes a strange sound and falls over. Her feet go up in the air, like a dead dog in a cartoon.</p><p>Here I become not so dignified. I fall down on my knees on the pavement and put my hands on Cordelia’s chest. I feel no heartbeat, and I try to remember the rules. Two fingers for babies, or you break the ribs. Cordelia is about this size. I put my two fingers on her chest and start to push. I think about the heartbeat—how fast? My own heart is pounding in my ears, too fast, but Cordelia is small. Perhaps the rhythm is right. I press down with each loud pulse in my head.</p><p>People walk around me on the street. I can feel them stare. A few speak: they ask can they help, should they call an ambulance. I only feel for the pulse. I think, absurdly, of the boy coughing and dying on my floor, in another time. I could not press on his chest because the blood was coming from his lungs, and everything had broken loose. I did not know what to do.</p><p>Now I press and press. My knees ache, and I think there is broken glass on the pavement, cutting into my skin, but it is only sand and grit. Minutes go by, and more minutes. My arms tremble. I count the times I push, and then stop counting. I wonder if I have broken Cordelia’s ribs. Someone told me once that this pressing does not work without the <em>truc machin</em>—the paddles to the heart. I think if I could open the bony chest I could hold the heart in my hand and squeeze it until it began to beat again.</p><p>Maybe someone should call an ambulance. But what would the driver say, arriving to see me with an old dog? Do they have this service for animals? I have no feeling in my hand.</p><p>“<em>Il est mort</em>,” a helpful person says, standing over me. A young man this time.</p><p>“<em>Elle</em>,” I say. The dog has her feet in the air. The world can see she is not a male. Do the<span data-page="page_4"></span> young know nothing? But when I look at her I think he is right—she is dead.</p><p>“<em>Ouais, bien, elle est morte</em>,” the young man says. And then he is gone.</p><p>I continue to press. I look at my watch, but I do not know what time we came outside.</p><p>And then Cordelia coughs. She opens her cloudy eyes. She seems to feel the indignity of her position, and she wriggles until her legs are under her. She coughs again, and shakes her head. She raises her eyebrows, as if to say how ridiculous we are, sitting in the street. What am I thinking, to make her so foolish? I struggle to my feet and pick her up, ignoring the people who stare. I carry her into the impasse. I can feel her heart beating against my arm. We take the tiny elevator—I have no strength for the stairs. In the faded bronze mirror, I have never looked so old.</p><p>In the apartment, James is awake, holding the Perrier bottle, in a white cotton dressing gown that Desi has ironed. He rubs his face, runs his fingers in his hair. “I didn’t know where you were,” he says.</p><p>“Outside.” My voice is hoarse.</p><p>“Another accident?” The green bottle is bright against the white cotton.</p><p>“The dog is killing me,” I say, and I hand Cordelia into his arms. “She was dead. Now she’s not.”</p><p>“Dead?” he says.</p><p>But I have no explaining left in me. My legs will not hold me up. “I’m going to bed.” I go into the bedroom, take off my clothes, step around the piss on the rug, and climb beneath the covers. Then I hear a scratching at the door, which opens, and small footsteps. Cordelia climbs the little carpeted steps at the end of the bed, which James bought when she couldn’t jump up anymore—there is still tenderness in him—and I feel the small body curl beside me. We sleep.</p><p>James calls the vet, and we take the dog together. The vet says Cordelia is mostly blind, and deaf, and demented. But she wags her tail, she eats some food. She puts on a good show, for the vet.</p><p>James asks the doctor, in many different ways, if Cordelia’s quality of life is not diminished. This is a code, a hint. He wants the vet to say maybe it is time to kill the dog. I find this more upsetting than I should. But the vet is cheerful and will not say the words. He pretends not to understand. He calls the dog Madame Lazarus and says it is a miracle, she has returned from the dead. Cordelia licks my hand as we drive home: a steady, appreciative lick. She knows.</p><p>The next morning, James leaves again, for Amsterdam, Dubai, I don’t know. Somewhere is a schedule. Desi comes to clean and make lunch, and I tell her what happened. We study the dog together. Cordelia wags her tail at us, she eats. But she cannot turn her head to the right anymore, only to the left. She turns her whole body in a circle when she wants to look right. No one asks how Lazarus felt after he came out of the tomb. Maybe it was not so good. Maybe he fell over and died again as soon as the people were not watching.</p><p>Desi goes to work on the spot on the rug, and I think of the morning after the doctor took the boy away, when the housekeeper found that I had washed some napkins and towels. She was French, her gray hair in a tight knot. It was not normal for me to wash anything. She frowned down at the place where the carpet was wet and a little pink, and I told her I had spilled the soup. She looked at me in the steady way of a <em>maîtresse</em> in school. And then she went back to her work, and said nothing.</p><p>Sometimes Cordelia takes her small steps into an empty room and stands there, staring. I follow to see what she sees: the furniture, the pictures on the walls. But can she see them? She is listening, maybe, for James’s voice. She stands there a long time, waiting for something that does not come.</p><p>I begin to carry her up and down the stairs and out to the street. Sometimes, after pissing on the rug, she cannot do it outside. I know this feeling, so I squeeze her to help, while people pass by. A river comes out. I carry her a bit so she can smell the air, and I think, My God, what comes next?</p><p>What comes next is a morning, three months later, when Cordelia does not get out of bed. I carry her to the street, but she cannot stand up. She does not wag her tail. She does not eat. I call James on his mobile in some other country. He sounds busy at first, but then he is listening, paying attention. The tenderness is there. He says, “<em>Chéri</em>, maybe it’s time.”</p><p>I wait for Desi to arrive. We speak English together, because she does not speak so much French, after so many years. Enough to shop and to eat. She lives with other Indonesians, it is not necessary. “Come with me to the vet,” I say.</p><p>Desi’s eyes slide away from<span data-page="page_5"></span> me, and I see she does not want to go, but then she collects her bag. I carry Cordelia, and we find a taxi. I cannot drive and hold the dog also, and Desi does not drive. The taxi-driver talks on his mobile, the radio is low—all in Arabic. Desi sits with her hands folded on her bag. Cordelia is very still in my lap.</p><p>I think about seeing that boy the first time, when I was only a child, before everything happened. The crown of hair, the dazzling eyes, the bolt of understanding. <em>N’en parlons plus jamais</em>.</p><p>At the vet’s office, I ask Desi to come to the back with me, but she shakes her head. She will wait.</p><p>The vet greets Cordelia, cheerful as before. “Madame Lazarus!” he says. But I do not want more jokes. I put her on the table. The doctor examines her. I press my hands together to stop the shaking. I feel a skip in my heart and think of the wine I will have at lunch.</p><p>“Ah, Cordelia,” the doctor says, stroking her. “<em>Tu n’es pas immortelle, après tout</em>.”</p><p>Cordelia looks for the source of the touch, with her cloudy eyes.</p><p>The doctor says it might be time. He says all the lines James suggested to him before, about the diminishing quality of life. I ask him to wait a moment. I go out to the waiting room, where Desi is sitting with a girl with purple hair and a small diamond in her nose. A big sheepdog lies at the girl’s feet. It lifts its heavy head to look at me, to see if I am a threat.</p><p>“Desi,” I say. “The vet says it’s time. Will you come in?”</p><p>Desi shakes her head, tears in her eyes. “I can’t,” she whispers. “I can’t see it.”</p><p>“Don’t make her,” the purple-haired girl says. She has a German accent. “It’s terrible. I was here two months ago, with my old dog, and I cried for a week after.”</p><p>I look at the German girl, whose business it is not. She is strong, a little heavy in the hips. I am the age of her grandfather. I do not want to talk about her dog, killed in this doctor’s office.</p><p>I turn back to Desi. “Please come in,” I say.</p><p>But Desi says no. She has cooked my food, cleaned my house, picked up after James for so many years I cannot count. Her job is to do as I ask, but she will not do this. “I can’t,” she says, and she is pleading.</p><p>So I go back alone to the room where Cordelia is on the table. Her eyes look at nothing. James was right to bring her home, to give me something to take care of.</p><p>“You look terrible,” the vet tells me. “Sit down.”</p><p>The nurse brings me a glass of water and says something comforting.</p><p>I think of James, our long life together, his shoetrees in the closet, his clothes on the floor. The dog is the last string to tie him to me, and now—snip. Soon I will start walking into the bedroom, staring at nothing, listening for voices that are not there.</p><p>“It’s your decision,” the vet says.</p><p>I nod.</p><p>“You can hold her,” the nurse says, and she puts Cordelia into my arms. Then she puts a pad on my leg like a diaper, beneath the dog, and I think, This will be bad.</p><p>Cordelia sniffs my hand, licks it once, and I am no longer sure about the quality of her life. She can still smell the world, she can still love. But then I remember the morning. Her legs not holding her up. I wish for a wild moment that I had brought Simone with me, my loyal wife, but she has never liked dogs. <em>Allergique</em>. The doctor is working—he ties a tourniquet on Cordelia’s leg, and then he prepares a needle. I think he will miss, he will jab it in my arm. But he doesn’t, he slips it into her thin leg where I can’t imagine there is a vein.</p><p>Cordelia looks around the room for something. We have to wait some minutes for the tranquillizer to work. I feel her pulse in her throat and think again that this is a mistake. Three months ago, I got on my knees to push blood through this small body, and now I am letting the doctor kill her. She closes her eyes, and I think I will tell him this is wrong, but he is already there with another needle, another injection. Cordelia flinches, she makes a little sigh. Then her head sinks, and her chin is on my hand, her throat soft. The white pad on my leg becomes heavy—she has gone in the wrong place one more time. The doctor takes her from me, and the nurse puts her hand on my shoulder.</p><p>Out in the waiting room, the German girl has her arm around Desi, and the two of them are crying. The sheepdog’s head is on the girl’s knee. Desi looks at me, her eyes wet and swollen, and I wonder, for the first time, if Cordelia will be the last string for Desi, also. She could find a new job and start again. She might find children to care for, to delight her as Cordelia did. It<span data-page="page_final"></span> would be more interesting than an old man.</p><p>I reach into my pocket for my wallet, but the receptionist shakes her head, makes a little gesture of sympathy. This is something, at least. They do not make you pay.</p><p>If we lived in the country, we could wrap Cordelia in a blanket and bury her, but we have nowhere, so we leave her with the vet. My arms feel empty. Outside, we wait for a taxi. I see an old man walking down the street, bent almost in half, even older than I. He would have been a young man during the war, but old enough to fight or to work or to run. I think I need something to carry. My mind is confused. I have just killed my dog. A taxi pulls up to the curb.</p><p>I turn to Desi, who is blowing her nose, looking at something in the street. Her black hair has some gray now. I never see her outside, in the sunlight. Her bag, bright yellow, hangs on her arm.</p><p>“Don’t leave me,” I say.</p><p>Desi looks up, surprised. Her eyes are red. The taxi is waiting, impatient. I think I will say everything now, I will speak of everything. There is not so much time.</p><p>“Please don’t leave,” I say. ♦</p>	Maile Meloy	June 23, 2014 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/06/23/madame-lazarus	Aging	Books	Death	Dogs	Fear	Homosexuals	Unnamed	First	Death
Mrs. Crasthorpe	<p>On the short walk from the churchyard to her car, Mrs. Crasthorpe was aware of a profound humiliation. A lone mourner at her husband’s funeral, she had sensed it first in the modest country church he had insisted upon for what he had called his obsequies. A woman cleric unknown to Mrs. Crasthorpe had conducted a bleak service, had said the necessary words in an accent that appalled Mrs. Crasthorpe, and then had scuttled off without so much as a glance in Mrs. Crasthorpe’s direction. Two men were waiting, leaning on their shovels in the nearby graveyard, and within minutes had returned the clay to where they had dug it from, making a little mound, the coffin gone forever and with it Arthur, all of it a mockery. She was wrong, Mrs. Crasthorpe knew, to blame Arthur for the arrangements he’d put in hand before he went, but she’d become used to blaming him in his lifetime and couldn’t help doing so still.</p><p>She was a woman of fifty-nine who declared herself to be forty-five because forty-five was what she felt. She had married a considerably older man, who had died in his seventy-second year. She had married him for his money, but, in spite of the comfort and convenience this had brought, Mrs. Crasthorpe believed that in marriage she had failed to blossom. Always a rosebud was how, privately, she thought of herself; and there was, in Mrs. Crasthorpe, a lot of privacy, there always had been. She knew she would tell no one, not ever, that Arthur had been buried without a decent sendoff, just as she’d told no one that she was the mother of a son or that there had been, in the late years of her marriage, Tommy Kildare and Donald.</p><p>“I shall relish my widowhood,” she asserted, aloud and firmly, in her car. “I shall make something of it.”</p><p>A light rain became heavier as she drove, the windscreen wipers slushing it away, a sound she particularly disliked. In the driving mirror, which she glanced at now and then, her blonded hair, her gray-blue eyes, the curve of her generously full lips pleased Mrs. Crasthorpe. She liked the look of herself, and always had.</p><p>She turned on the radio to suppress the windscreen-wiper noise, wondering as she did so why Arthur had chosen to be buried in such an obscure place, wondering what it was she hadn’t listened to when she’d been told. Faintly, on some foreign station, popular music passed from tune to tune, each one known to Mrs. Crasthorpe, since they were of her time.</p><p>Etheridge let himself in quietly, not releasing the catch of the lock until he’d pulled it to and could open the door soundlessly. With luck, Janet would have slept and would be sleeping still. Sleep was everything to her now, the kindest friend, the tenderest lover. She didn’t allow it to be induced, the drugs she was offered invariably declined.</p><p>He looked down at the sleeping face that illness was taking from him, a little more each day. For a moment he saw in the wan, tired features the shadows of Juliet, the wisdom of Portia, Estella’s thoughtless pride. “I’ll go,” the carer whispered from the doorway.</p><p>“Dear Janet,” he whispered himself, wondering how her day had been.</p><p>When he had made tea, Etheridge carried the tray back to the bedside and the rattle of the cup and saucer woke his wife, as every day it did. It was what Janet wanted, what she liked: that she should always be awake when he was here.</p><p>“Hello again,” she said.</p><p>He bent to embrace her, and held her for a moment in his arms, then plumped her pillows up and straightened the turndown of her top sheet. She said, when he asked, that she was feeling better. But she didn’t eat any of the cake he had brought, or the biscuits, and didn’t look as well as she had that morning.</p><p>“Oh, nothing to write home about,” he responded to a query as to how the day had been for him. She’d finished “A Fine Balance,” she said. She’d heard a program about silverware on the radio. “Well, no,” she said. “Not interesting at all.”</p><p>“Some soup later, darling? Cream cracker?”</p><p>“Soup would be lovely. No cream cracker.”</p><p>“We landed the contract. I thought we wouldn’t.”</p><p>“I knew you would.”</p><p>She was an actress. He had been settled for years in the offices of Forrester and Bright, a firm of specialist printers that had made a corner for itself by taking on complicated assignments that other printers couldn’t be bothered with. In their early forties now, they’d been married since they were both twenty-three.</p><p>“It’s awful for you,” Janet said, gloomy as she sometimes was when she’d just woken up.</p><p>“Of course it isn’t.” Without an effort, the familiar reassurance came.</p><p>They smiled at each other. They knew it was awful.</p><p>“ ‘University Challenge’ tonight,” Janet said.</p><p>“You’ll behave yourself,” the warder said.</p><p>“I always do.”</p><p>“She’s here. You see you do.”</p><p>Derek wished she wouldn’t come. It was silly from both their points of view. She knew it was, it wasn’t as if she didn’t, but still she came. She’d tell him the latest about the old boy and he’d try not to hear. She’d tell him because there was nothing else to tell<span data-page="page_2"></span> him. She’d sit there in her finery, ashamed of him and ashamed of being ashamed. She had called it “naughty” once, the way he was. She didn’t call it anything now.</p><p>He heard the click of her heels, a sprightly sound, different from the thump of boots. The warder respected her, knowing her from her visits; he was a nice man, she said. She liked people being nice.</p><p>“Now, you behave, lad.” The warder again rebuked Derek in advance, a white splotch on the shiny peak of his cap his only untidiness.</p><p>“You see that?” Derek said when she came. “A bird done its business on Mr. Fane.”</p><p>He teased her with bad grammar and she winced when he did, although she pretended she didn’t mind. She was on about something new: the old boy had died and no one had come to the funeral. Derek hadn’t known him, there had never been a reason that they should have known each other, but even so she talked about him.</p><p>“You all right?” she asked.</p><p>“Oh, great,” he said.</p><p>And that was all; Mrs. Crasthorpe accepted without protest that their brief exchanges were over. “You’re good, the way you come,” the warder said when she began to go. She left a pot of damson jam, which was a favorite.</p><p>She hailed a taxi and asked to be taken to Pasmore’s. She had phoned, as she always did, to make sure there’d be a table for her, and there it was, in the corner she had come to regard as hers. They didn’t gush in Pasmore’s; you could feel the dignity of their being above it. They spoke almost in whispers, but you could hear every word, because they wanted you to. She always had tea in Pasmore’s after visiting Derek.</p><p>As she ordered from the waitress, who had come at once to her, her thoughts picked up from where she’d left them, no different from the thoughts she always had in Pasmore’s. He couldn’t help himself; he didn’t try. He wasn’t the kind to try, he had explained: he liked being a persistent offender. Yet even so it couldn’t be less than horrid for him. That it must be horrid had many times haunted Mrs. Crasthorpe at this same table, and she pressed it away from her now, glancing about for a face she recognized among the teatime people. But, as always, there wasn’t one.</p><p>“How nice!” She smiled away her dejection when her sultana scones came and her tea was poured for her, which they always did for one at Pasmore’s.</p><p>When Janet died, painlessly in her sleep, Etheridge moved from the flat in Barnes to a smaller one in Weymouth Street. No practicality or economic necessity inspired the change. It was just that Barnes, shadowed now by death, was not as once it had been. Its spaciousness, its quiet streets, stared back at Etheridge morosely, the jazz pub that had been theirs seeming ordinary, the river unappealing. The same flowers blooming again in the window boxes should have been a memory and a solace, but were not. Moving in at Weymouth Street, Etheridge thought of leaving Forrester and Bright, of leaving London, too, but when a few weeks had gone by Weymouth Street seemed far enough. It had no past; it tugged at nothing. He settled there.</p><p>Mrs. Crasthorpe set about making something special of her widowhood with a will. She spent a week in Eastbourne, clarifying her thoughts, for the town’s modest opulence, its unhurried peace and sense of other times had had a calming effect before. Nothing had changed: the Parades, the Grand Hotel, the well-dressed people on the streets, the unfearful sea all drew once more from Mrs. Crasthorpe an admiration that went back to her girlhood. It was in Eastbourne that she first had felt the better for being alive. She could think more productively in the briny air; she got things right. Funeral weeds had had their day, solemn rites were dead and gone: in the dining room of the Grand Hotel, she sensed that she was forgiven for her unshed tears, the grief she could not manage. Shambling through his days, Arthur hadn’t wanted to know about Tommy Kildare or Donald. “We’re chalk and cheese,” he’d said vaguely. He’d left her everything.</p><p>She walked about in Eastbourne, going nowhere, wondering if she would meet a chum, and when she didn’t it seemed better that she shouldn’t, that privately and on her own she should dwell on how life should be now. In this, she did not banish fantasy: Her chums would give her a party, for they were party people. In twos and threes, they would stand about and see in her another woman, and Derek would come with presents, as he never had before, and Tommy Kildare would be as once he’d been. So young she seemed, he’d say, she could be seventeen. And Donald would kiss her fingers and call himself a Regency buck.</p><p>When he’d first moved to Weymouth Street, Etheridge hadn’t hung up the print of Seurat’s “Sunday Afternoon,” but then he did, because it was a shame not to. Framed and wrapped, it had been waiting for him one September 12th, probably his fortieth, he thought. The sum of the accumulated I.O.U.s, each one dated April 4th, hadn’t become enough for Janet’s earrings; it<span data-page="page_3"></span> would have if there’d been one more year. Sometimes, even in Weymouth Street, such lesser shadows flitted about, but Etheridge dismissed this interference as a trick of the light or of his own imagination. Work was a help, and when he had been in Weymouth Street for almost six months he ceased to lie sleepless in the lonely early hours. Recollections were less distinct; bits of remembered conversation were somehow lost; the last of the clothes were given away. At a cookery class, he learned to make risotto and eggs Benedict. He played the piano more skillfully than before, had a drink every evening in the Cock and Lion, read Mauriac in French, and was promoted at Forrester and Bright.</p><p>Mrs. Crasthorpe had earlier noticed somewhere the man who was coming toward her in Beaumont Street. His tie bore the colors of a regiment or a public school. His hands were delicate: gentle hands, Mrs. Crasthorpe surmised, the fingernails well kept. He had looks and, she imagined, charm; she liked the way he dressed. She liked his serious expression as he walked, how he seemed to dwell on serious matters, unravelling confusion, clever. He wasn’t in a hurry. She liked that, too.</p><p>“Enford Crescent,” she said to herself, wondering how long it had been since Enford Crescent was plucked out of nowhere by Tups or Primmie, she couldn’t remember which. You asked the way to Enford Crescent when a boy you liked the look of came along. He wouldn’t know, he couldn’t know: there was no Enford Crescent. For an hour once, Primmie and a nameless boy had trailed about, searching for what they would never find, falling in love, so Primmie had said. And Tups, another time, searching also, was taken to the Palm Grove and was bought a Peach Surprise.</p><p>“I think it’s probably quite near,” Etheridge said when he was asked for directions to somewhere he thought he’d once noticed on a street sign. “Excuse me,” he called out to a couple with a dog on a lead. “This lady’s looking for Enford Crescent.”</p><p>The couple had been engaged in an argumentative conversation, which had abruptly ceased. They were middle-aged and tired-looking, a note of impatience in both their voices. The dog was a black-and-white smooth-haired fox terrier, snappish because it disliked its lead.</p><p>“Enford?” the man who restrained it repeated. “Not round here, I shouldn’t think.” His companion nodded her agreement.</p><p>The woman who’d asked for directions was smiling rather helplessly now, Etheridge thought. “Never mind,” she said.</p><p>The couple and the dog went on. “You’ve been most kind,” the woman in search of Enford Crescent said.</p><p>“Well, hardly that.”</p><p>“Oh, yes. Indeed.”</p><p>“I’m sorry I misled you.”</p><p>“No, no.”</p><p>“Someone will know when you ask again.”</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>Mrs. Crasthorpe watched the man she had spoken to walking away from her, and when he passed out of sight she missed him as if she knew him. He had a cultivated voice and was polite without being like an icicle. She’d always been attracted by fair-haired men.</p><p>Still gazing into the empty distance, she felt the weight of her age. She’d been impulsive once upon a time, hasty and not caring that she was. Tups had called her a spur-of-the-moment girl. Primmie had, too. They’d liked the impulsiveness in her; she’d liked it herself. He would have done, the fair-haired man, she’d known he would. She would have told him. He would have listened and understood. She knew that, too, and yet she’d let him go.</p><p>For no particular reason, when Janet was ill, Etheridge had begun to fill the remaining pages of a half-used ledger book with autobiographical jottings. He did not intend this to be a diary, simply a record of early childhood, his own and Janet’s, some later memories collected, too. It established time and place, what had been shared and what had not, the marriage, and people known and houses lived in. While he was homesick at a Gloucestershire boarding school, Janet was being taught at home by a Miss Francis, school being considered a risk for a delicate child. Her first theatrical appearance, unnamed, unnoticed, was in the pantomime chorus of “Jack and the Beanstalk.” Short-skirted, glamorous, she was seventeen, while Etheridge, not then known to her, was waiting for a vocation to offer itself. They met when Janet came to London.</p><p>Alone thirty years later, Etheridge could not forgive her death and imagined he never would. He sensed that his feelings were unreasonable and he struggled to dismiss them, disliking himself for what seemed to be a selfishness. But, still, resentment hung about. Why should she not have what mostly people did have? Why was she now mere dust?</p><p>The autumn that came was an Indian summer, and every weekend, on either Saturday or Sunday, Etheridge walked in Regent’s Park. He learned from a book the names of flowers he didn’t know; he fed the birds. But mainly, while time passed more slowly than on weekdays, he watched from a pavement table of a café the people who came and went. He envied them, and he envied himself as he had been.</p><p>When, years ago and halfway through her marriage, Mrs. Crasthorpe had discovered this same part of London, she had liked it at once. She had visited it to inspect,<span data-page="page_4"></span> and take her pick of, an elderly woman’s jewelry, the woman once well-to-do but no longer. Mrs. Crasthorpe had bought three rings and a bracelet, and when, a month or so later, the same advertisement appeared again she made a second journey and on her return persuaded her husband to sell their house and buy one she had seen in Coppice Mews. She liked the mews, she liked the streets, and so did he; he hadn’t at first but with time she’d persuaded him that he did. He died in Coppice Mews, apologizing for having to leave her on her own and for wanting to be buried in a small country churchyard she considered unsuitable for the urban man he’d been. She honored his wishes nonetheless, and was already on familiar terms with the people of the shops, had the mews house painted in the colors she had previously wanted. All of which, for Mrs. Crasthorpe, increased the pleasure of widowhood.</p><p>A faintly familiar face was what Etheridge was aware of, without knowing where or when he’d seen it before. Then he remembered and nodded at the woman who was turning the pages of a newspaper at the next table.</p><p>She stared at him when he did so, as if her thoughts had been similar to his. “Good Lord!” a moment later she exclaimed. Her scent was as pungent as it had been when she had asked for directions. Her clothes were different. She held out a hand that was just within Etheridge’s reach. “I rather think we’ve met before,” she said.</p><p>“Well, yes, we have.”</p><p>“What weather!”</p><p>“It’s lovely.”</p><p>“A day for the races!”</p><p>She used to go racing often, she said. The Oaks, the Derby, Cheltenham. Wimbledon for the tennis, Henley. “Oh, such a lot,” she said, but things were quieter now. Inevitable, of course, as the years pile up.</p><p>She was handsome in her fleshy way, Etheridge supposed. Careful, experienced. You couldn’t call her gross, and there was something in her lavish, well-used smile that was almost delicate. Her teeth were very white. Her breasts were firm, her knees trim. She fiddled with a brooch she wore, a loop of tiny stones, chips of sapphire and washed-out ruby they might have been, the only decoration on a pale-cream dress. Sometimes a languid look came into her features and, for a moment, then they were tranquil.</p><p>“What a troublesome country Cambodia is!” she chattily remarked, folding away her newspaper as she spoke. “You’d think they’d have more sense.”</p><p>She was the worst in the world about names, she confided, seeming to imply that Etheridge had told her his on their previous encounter, which he hadn’t. His coffee came, too hot to be drunk in a couple of gulps, allowing him to go away.</p><p>It was extraordinary, Mrs. Crasthorpe marvelled, that he should again be here, this attractive stranger who had continued to float about in her consciousness and whom she’d made herself love a little. What lengths she went to, she reflected, how determinedly she guarded herself from the cruelty that was more than Tommy Kildare’s treachery or Donald deciding that he was homosexual, more than the haunting years of Arthur’s dreary world, more than tediousness and boredom. How good the everyday was, the ordinary, with its lesser tribulations and simple pleasures. “What are you thinking?” she asked.</p><p>Unable to find the white lies that were always there for him, Etheridge muttered incomprehensibly. He wondered if this talkative woman was drunk, but the flow of information about herself had come in an orderly manner, suggesting that she was not.</p><p>“How attractive your name is,” she said. “Crasthorpe is appalling, don’t you think?”</p><p>She had been Georgina Gilmour once, she said, the same Gilmours who had carried their name all over the English-speaking world. The Crasthorpes had never been much and were, of course, unrelated to her.</p><p>“How much I enjoy conversation with strangers,” in passing she revealed.</p><p>She spoke about the Gilmours at some length, their place in Scotland for the shooting, the child among them in the past who’d been a musical genius, and Nanny Fortescue, to whom three generations had been devoted, and old Wyse Gilmour, who’d raced at Silverstone and lived to be a hundred and two.</p><p>“Well, there you are,” she said, without finality. She scribbled on the edge of her newspaper and handed him the scrap of paper she tore off: she’d written down her address.</p><p>“We clearly are not birds of a feather,” pensively she concluded. “But if you should ever think we might know one another better I’m nearly always at home in the afternoon.”</p><p>He nodded vaguely. Abrupt and dogmatic, her manner might have seemed rude, but she managed to make it an unawareness, as probably it was.</p><p>“Your wife,” she said. “You mentioned your wife.”</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>“I thought you said your wife . . .”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“I thought . . .”</p><p>“My wife died.”</p><p>Afterward, Etheridge avoided having coffee at that particular café, but several times he caught a glimpse of Mrs. Crasthorpe, once coming out of the Cock and Lion. It had surprised him when she’d said that they weren’t birds of a feather: he had imagined that that was what she’d thought they were. He avoided the Cock and Lion, too, and frequented instead the Admiral’s Rest, which was farther away<span data-page="page_5"></span> and rougher. Once, he heard his name called out in Vincent Street and walked more quickly on. Mrs. Crasthorpe did not interest or concern him, and it was hard to believe that this pushy, over-lively woman might possess qualities more appealing than her manner. Crowded out by his continuing anger at the careless greed of death, her attentions were hardly noticed. Mrs. Crasthorpe would fade away to nothing, which was what she had been before she asked him for directions.</p><p>But, having lunch at Le Paon one day with the two men from the office he regularly had lunch with, he thought he saw Mrs. Crasthorpe on the street. The plate-glass terrace doors of the restaurant had not been folded back, as in high summer they invariably were: Le Paon in early autumn echoed only with its own murmur of voices, enlivened with occasional laughter. All three men had ordered chops; a glass of house wine had been brought to each. Their conversation while they waited was devoted to the difficulties that had arisen because a typeface was neither available nor obtainable. “I’ll try Thompson’s this afternoon,” one of Etheridge’s colleagues said, and the other mentioned J. Sinclair’s in Edinburgh. Etheridge said nothing.</p><p>Mrs. Crasthorpe wasn’t wearing her pale-cream dress but, instead, a flowery one he had also become familiar with. She was standing still, in conversation with a figure in a long black overcoat that looked, at least from a distance, to be much too heavy for the time of year. Its wearer—his back to the restaurant’s façade and to Etheridge—gestured repeatedly, as if in persuasion. Mrs. Crasthorpe did not seem happy. From time to time, she attempted to move away, only to be drawn back by her companion’s insistence that their encounter should continue.</p><p>“Your chops, sir,” a waiter said, and there were roast potatoes and parsnips mashed and rich brown gravy.</p><p>“Or possibly Langford’s.” Etheridge at last contributed something to what was being discussed, feeling that he should.</p><p>When the meal ended, he noticed that while he hadn’t been looking the conversation on the street appeared to have become a fracas. Mrs. Crasthorpe and the man in the black coat were now at the center of a small crowd, the man still gesturing, Mrs. Crasthorpe more agitated than before. Etheridge could hear the voices of several bystanders raised in angry abuse that was clearly directed at the blackly clad figure. Two elderly women pushed to get closer to him; a bearded man was restrained from striking him; a younger woman was shouting into a mobile telephone. Then the gesticulating ceased, and the man in the black coat shrugged, his arms raised in despair, his comic stance suggesting that something he considered to be a source of humor had been misunderstood. Etheridge didn’t feel the incident was worth drawing to his colleagues’ attention, and by the time he reached the street himself the crowd had disappeared and Mrs. Crasthorpe had, too. The man in the black coat was laughing, his wrists held out to the two policemen who had taken charge of him.</p><p>Unnatural little bastard, the warder’s unspoken thought was when he heard that this arrest had taken place. His own mother, the thought went on, who brought him jam and did her best. His own mother, and in broad daylight.</p><p>“Only teasing,” Derek said the next time she came. “I thought you’d be amused.”</p><p>She wept where no one could see her. She never had where anyone could, not ever in all the days and nights, all the waking up to another incident and Arthur knowing nothing. She hadn’t wept when Tommy Kildare had had enough of her or when Donald needed something different. But she wept her private tears whenever she imagined the coat unbuttoned, the sudden twitch as it opened wide, the torch’s flash. She wept because she loved him as she did no other human being. She always had. She always would.</p><p>In time, Etheridge married again, a relationship that strengthened as the years passed, his contentment in it similar to the contentment he had discovered in marriage before. It seemed natural in the circumstances to move away from Weymouth Street and he did so; natural, too, to buy a house in quiet Petersham, rescuing it from years of neglect and subsequent decay. A child was born there, and then another.</p><p>To his second wife, Etheridge talked about his first, which caused neither offense nor irritation, and even the bitter chagrin of his mourning was understood. He considered himself fortunate in almost every aspect of his life as it now was, in his wife and his children, in the position he held at Forrester and Bright, in the open sward of Petersham, its city buses plying daily, its city sounds a whisper in a quieter London.</p><p>Another winter passed, another spring, and most of summer. August became September, and it was then, as the days were shortening, that the name Crasthorpe occurred again. The name was unusual, and it caught Etheridge’s eye in a newspaper item concerning a woman who in the night had fallen down in the street and had lain there until she was discovered by refuse collectors when the dusk of another early morning came. She had died while being conveyed to hospital in the refuse men’s enormous vehicle, a reek of whiskey emanating from her<span data-page="page_final"></span> sodden clothes. Cold print reported a scene that moved him: a shrunken body gently placed on a bed of waste, the refuse men standing awkwardly then, saying nothing. The woman was thought to be a vagrant, but Etheridge saw blonded hair bedraggled and stockinged knees, an easy smile and clothes he remembered. Chatter he’d been unable to escape from he remembered, too: childhood friends recalled, and going to the races, and conversations with strangers. He’d thrown away the scrap of paper that had been pressed upon him, its sprawl of handwriting unread. In Vincent Street, he had hurried on.</p><p>But the curiosity that Mrs. Crasthorpe had failed to inspire in her lifetime came now. Why had she lain all night where she had fallen? Why were her clothes saturated with whiskey, she who had been so conventional and respectable? What did her wordless epitaph say?</p><p>Lost somewhere in the crowded tangle bound by Mare Street, Morning Lane, and Urswick Road is unmarked Falter Way, the sign that once identified it claimed by vandals long ago. It is a narrow passage, not greatly used because it terminates abruptly and leads nowhere. No street lights burn at night in Falter Way, no brass plate or printed notice proclaims the practice of commerce or a profession. There are no shops in Falter Way, no bars, no breakfast cafés. No enterprising business girls hang about in doorways.</p><p>“Crasthorpe.” A uniformed policeman repeated the name and shrugged away his dismay.</p><p>“Poor bloody woman,” his colleague said, and closed his notebook.</p><p>There was nothing untoward to report, nothing to add or alter. What had happened here was evident and apparent, without a trace of anything that needed to be looked at more carefully.</p><p>In turn, the two men telephoned, then went away.</p><p>Derek wondered why his mother didn’t come and hoped it was because at last she’d realized that all of it was ridiculous. When the old boy died she’d said, “Come to the house,” and he hadn’t understood that she meant to live there. She could pass him off as a houseboy, her idea was; she couldn’t see the snags. Once, she would have said that snags didn’t matter. Once, she’d liked being teased. Funny how she was.</p><p>Etheridge found it hard to forget Mrs. Crasthorpe, although he wanted to. It shamed him that he had thought so little of her, a woman not really known to him, and then only because she’d been embarrassing and even a nuisance. He had read about Falter Way in the newspaper report of her death and had wondered why she had gone there. On an impulse, when months afterward he was near it himself, he asked about Mrs. Crasthorpe, and although she was remembered, no one had known her name. In nearby Dring Street and the shoddy bars of Breck Hill, he imagined her, a different woman, drinking heavily. She went with men, a barman said, she liked a man.</p><p>Etheridge guessed his way through the mystery of Mrs. Crasthorpe, but too much was missing and he resisted further speculation. He sensed his own pity, not knowing why it was there. He honored a tiresome woman’s secret and saw it kept. ♦</p>	William Trevor	February 26, 2018 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/02/26/mrs-crasthorpe	Death	Mourning	Widows	Widowers	Illness		Mrs. Crasthorpe	Third	Death
Musa	<p>Musa <span data-page="page_1"></span>was my older brother. His head seemed to strike the clouds. He was quite tall, yes, and his body was thin and knotty from hunger and the strength that comes from anger. He had an angular face, big hands that protected me, and hard eyes, because our ancestors had lost their land. But when I think about it I believe that he already loved us then the way the dead do, with no useless words and a look in his eyes that came from the hereafter. I have only a few pictures of him in my head, but I want to describe them to you carefully. For example, the day he came home early from the neighborhood market, or maybe from the port, where he worked as a handyman and a porter, toting, dragging, lifting, sweating. Anyway, that day he came upon me while I was playing with an old tire, and he put me on his shoulders and told me to hold on to his ears, as if his head were a steering wheel. I remember the joy I felt as he rolled the tire along and made a sound like a motor. His smell comes back to me, too, a persistent mingling of rotten vegetables, sweat, and breath. Another picture in my memory is from the day of Eid one year. Musa had given me a hiding the day before for some stupid thing I’d done, and now we were both embarrassed. It was a day of forgiveness and he was supposed to kiss me, but I didn’t want him to lose face and lower himself by apologizing to me, not even in God’s name. I also remember his gift for immobility, the way he could stand stock still on the threshold of our house, facing the neighbors’ wall, holding a cigarette and the cup of black coffee our mother brought him.</p><p>Our father had disappeared long ago and existed now in fragments in the rumors we heard from people who claimed to have run into him in France. Only Musa could hear his voice. He’d give Musa commands in his dreams, and Musa would relay them to us. My brother had seen our father just once since he left, and from such a distance that he wasn’t even sure it was him. As a child, I learned how to distinguish the days with rumors from the days without. When Musa heard people talking about my father, he’d come home all feverish gestures and burning eyes, and then he and Mama would have long, whispered conversations that ended in heated arguments. I was excluded from those, but I got the gist: for some obscure reason, my brother held a grudge against Mama, and she defended herself in a way that was even more obscure. Those were unsettling days and nights, filled with anger, and I lived in fear at the idea that Musa might leave us, too. But he’d always return at dawn, drunk, oddly proud of his rebellion, seemingly endowed with renewed vigor. Then he’d sober up and fade away. All he wanted to do was sleep, and in this way my mother would get him under her control again.</p><p>I have some pictures in my head—they’re all I can offer you. A cup of coffee, some cigarette butts, his espadrilles, Mama crying and then recovering quickly to smile at a neighbor who’d come to borrow some tea or spices, moving from distress to courtesy so fast that it made me doubt her sincerity, as young as I was. Everything revolved around Musa, and Musa revolved around our father, whom I never knew and who left me nothing but our family name. Do you know what we were called in those days? <em>Uled el-assas</em>, the sons of the guardian. Of the watchman, to be more precise. My father had worked as a night watchman in a factory where they made I don’t know what. One night, he disappeared. And that’s all. That’s the story I was told. It happened in the nineteen-thirties, right after I was born.</p><p>So Musa was a god for me, a simple god of few words. His thick beard and powerful arms made him seem like a giant who could have wrung the neck of any soldier in an ancient Pharaoh’s army. Which was why, on the day we learned of his death and the circumstances surrounding it, I didn’t feel sad or angry at first; instead, I felt disappointed and offended, as if someone had insulted me. My brother was capable of parting the sea, and yet he died in insignificance, like a bit player, on a beach that is no longer there, beside the waves that should have made him famous forever.</p><p>As a child, I was allowed to hear only one story at night, only one deceptively wonderful tale. It was the story of Musa, my murdered brother, which took a different form each time, according to my mother’s mood. In my memory, those nights are associated with rainy winters, with the dim light of the oil lamp in our hovel, and with Mama’s murmuring voice. Such nights didn’t come often, only when we were short on food, when it was cold, and, maybe, when Mama felt even more like a widow than usual. Oh, stories die, you know, and I can’t remember<span data-page="page_2"></span> exactly what the poor woman told me, but she knew how to summon up unlikely things, tales of hand-to-hand combat between Musa, the invisible giant, and the <em>gaouri</em>, the <em>roumi</em>, the big fat Frenchman, the obese thief of sweat and land. And so, in our imaginations, my brother Musa was commissioned to perform different tasks: repay a blow, avenge an insult, recover a piece of confiscated land, collect a paycheck. All of a sudden, this legendary Musa acquired a horse and a sword and the aura of a spirit come back from the dead to redress injustice. And, well, you know how it goes. When he was alive, he had a reputation as a quick-tempered man with a fondness for impromptu boxing matches. Most of Mama’s tales, however, were chronicles of Musa’s last day, which was also, in a way, the first day of his immortality. Mama could narrate the events of that day in such staggering detail that they almost came to life. She never described a murder and a death; instead, she’d evoke a fantastic transformation, one that turned a simple young man from one of the poorer quarters of Algiers into an invincible, long-awaited hero, a kind of savior. The details would change. In some versions of the story, Musa had left the house a little earlier than usual, awakened by a prophetic dream or a terrifying voice that had pronounced his name. In others, he’d answered the call of some friends—<em>uled el-huma</em>, sons of the neighborhood—idle young men interested in skirts, cigarettes, and scars. An obscure discussion ensued and resulted in Musa’s death. I’m not sure: Mama had a thousand and one stories, and the truth meant little to me at that age. What was most important at those moments was my almost sensual closeness with Mama, our silent reconciliation during the night to come. The next morning, everything was always back in its place, my mother in one world and me in another.</p><p>What can I tell you, Mr. Investigator, about a crime committed in a book? I don’t know what happened on that particular day, in that gruesome summer, between six o’clock in the morning and two in the afternoon, the hour of Musa’s death. And, in any case, after Musa was killed nobody came around to question us. There was no serious investigation. I have a hard time remembering what I myself did that day. In the morning, the usual neighborhood characters were awake and on the street. Down at one end, we had Tawi and his sons. Tawi was a heavyset fellow. Dragged his bad left leg, had a nagging cough, smoked a lot. And, early each morning, it was his habit to step outside and pee on a wall, as blithely as you please. Everybody knew him, because his ritual was so unvarying that he served as a clock; the broken cadence of his footsteps and his cough were the first signs that the new day had arrived on our street. Farther up on the right, there was El-Hadj, “the pilgrim”—which he was by genealogy, not because he’d made the trip to Mecca. El-Hadj was just his given name. He, too, was the silent type. His main occupations seemed to be striking his mother and eying his neighbors with a permanent air of defiance. On the near corner of the adjacent alley, a Moroccan had a café called El-Blidi. His sons were liars and petty thieves, capable of stealing all the fruit off every tree. They’d invented a game: they would throw matches into the sidewalk gutters, where the wastewater ran, and then follow the course of those matches. They never tired of doing that. I also remember an old woman, Taï bia, big, fat, childless, and very temperamental. There was something unsettling and even a little voracious in the way she looked at us—other women’s offspring—that made us giggle nervously. We were just a little collection of lice on the back of the huge geological animal that was the city, with its thousand alleys.</p><p>So, on that particular day, nothing unusual. Even Mama, who loved omens and was sensitive to spirits, failed to detect anything abnormal. A routine day, in short—women calling to one another, laundry hung out on the terraces, street venders. No one could have heard a gunshot from so far away, a shot fired downtown, on the beach. Not even at the devil’s hour, two o’clock on a summer afternoon—the siesta hour. So, I repeat, nothing unusual. Later, of course, I thought about it and, little by little, I concluded that there had to be—among the thousand versions Mama offered, among her memory fragments and her still vivid intuitions—there had to be one version that was truer than the others.</p><p>By telling me so many implausible tales and outright lies, Mama eventually aroused my suspicions and put my own intuitions in order. I reconstructed the whole thing. Musa’s frequent binges during that period, the scent floating in the air, his proud smile when he ran into his friends, their overserious, almost comical confabs, the way my brother had of playing with his knife and showing me his tattoos: <em>Echedda fi Allah</em>, “God is my support.” “March or die” on his right shoulder. “Be quiet” on his left forearm, under a drawing of a broken heart. This was the only book that Musa wrote. Shorter than a last<span data-page="page_3"></span> sigh, just three sentences inscribed on the oldest paper in the world, his own skin. I remember his tattoos the way most people remember their first picture book. Other details? Oh, I don’t know, his overalls, his espadrilles, his prophet’s beard, his big hands, which tried to hold on to our father’s ghost, and his history with a nameless, honorless woman.</p><p>Ah! The mystery woman! Provided that she existed at all. I know only her first name; at least, I presume it was hers. My brother had spoken it in his sleep that night, the night before his death: Zubida. A sign? Maybe. In any case, the day Mama and I left the neighborhood forever—Mama had decided to get away from Algiers and the sea—I’m sure I saw a woman staring at us. A very intense stare. She was wearing a short skirt and tacky stockings, and she’d done her hair the way the movie stars did in those days: although she was quite obviously a brunette, her hair was dyed blond. “Zubida forever,” ha-ha! Perhaps my brother had those words tattooed somewhere on his body as well—I don’t know for sure. But I am sure that it was her that day.</p><p>It was early in the morning. We were setting out, Mama and I, leaving the house for good, and there she was, holding a little red purse, staring at us from some distance away. I can still see her lips and her huge eyes, which seemed to be asking us for something. I’m almost certain that it was her. At the time, I wanted it to be her, and I decided that it was, because that added something to the tale of my brother’s demise somehow. I needed Musa to have had an excuse, a reason. Without realizing it, I rejected the absurdity of his death; I needed a story to give him a shroud. Well, then. I pulled Mama by her haik, so that she wouldn’t see the woman. But she must have sensed something, because she made a horrible face and spat out a prodigiously vulgar insult. I turned around, but the woman had disappeared. And then we left.</p><p>I remember the road to our new home, in the village of Hadjout, the fields whose crops weren’t destined for us, the naked sun, the other travellers on the dusty bus. The oil fumes nauseated me, but I loved the virile, almost comforting roar of the engine, like a kind of father that was snatching us, my mother and me, out of an enormous labyrinth of buildings, downtrodden people, shantytowns, dirty urchins, aggressive cops, and beaches fatal to Arabs. For the two of us, the city would always be the scene of the crime, the place where something pure and ancient was lost. Yes, Algiers, in my memory, is a dirty, corrupt creature, a dark, treacherous man-stealer.</p><p>Let’s see, let me try to remember exactly. . . . How did we first learn of Musa’s death? I remember a kind of invisible cloud hovering over our street, and angry grownups talking loudly and gesticulating. At first, Mama told me that a <em>gaouri</em> had killed one of our neighbor’s sons while he was trying to defend an Arab woman and her honor. But, during the night, anxiety got inside our house, and I think Mama began to realize the truth. So did I, probably. And then, all of a sudden, I heard this long, low moan, swelling until it became immense, a huge mass of sound that destroyed our furniture and blew apart our walls and then the whole neighborhood and left me all alone. I remember starting to cry for no reason, just because everyone was looking at me. Mama had disappeared, and I was shoved outside, ejected by something more important than me, absorbed into some kind of collective disaster. Strange, don’t you think? I told myself, confusedly, that this probably had to do with my father, that he was definitely dead this time, which made me sob twice as hard. It was a long night; nobody slept. A constant stream of people came to offer their condolences. The grownups spoke to me solemnly. When I couldn’t understand what they were telling me, I contented myself with looking at their hard eyes, their shaking hands, and their shabby shoes. By the time dawn came, I was very hungry, and I fell asleep I don’t know where. No matter how much I dig around in my memory, I have no recollection at all of that day and the next, except of the smell of couscous. The days blurred into an interminable single day, like a broad, deep valley I meandered through. The last day of a man’s life doesn’t exist. Outside of storybooks, there’s no hope, nothing but soap bubbles bursting. That’s the best proof of our absurd existence, my dear friend: no one is granted a final day, only an accidental interruption of life.</p><p>These days, my mother’s so old she looks like her own mother, or maybe her great-grandmother, or even her great-great-grandmother. Once we reach a certain age, time gives us the features of all our ancestors, combined in a soft jumble of reincarnations. And maybe that’s what the next world is—an endless corridor where all your ancestors are lined up, one after another. They turn toward their<span data-page="page_4"></span> living descendant and simply wait, without words, without movement, their patient eyes fixed on a date. I don’t know my mother’s age, just as she has no idea how old I am. Before Independence, people did without exact dates; the rhythms of life were marked by births, epidemics, food shortages, and so on. My grandmother died of typhus, an episode that by itself served to establish a calendar. My father left on a December 1st, and since then that date has been a reference point for measuring the temperature of the heart, so to speak.</p><p>You want the truth? I rarely go to see my mother nowadays. She lives in a house under a sky where a dead man and a lemon tree loiter. She spends her days sweeping every corner of that house in Hadjout, formerly known as Marengo, seventy kilometres from the capital. That was where I spent the second half of my childhood and part of my youth, before going to Algiers to learn a profession (government land administration) and then returning to Hadjout to practice it. We—my mother and I—had put as much distance as possible between us and the sound of breaking waves.</p><p>Let’s take up the chronology again. We left Algiers—on that famous day when I was sure I’d spotted Zubida—and went to stay with an uncle and his family, who barely tolerated us. We lived in a hovel before being kicked out by the very people who’d taken us in. Then we lived in a little shed on the threshing floor of a colonial farm, where we both had jobs, Mama as a maid and I as an errand boy. The boss was this obese guy from Alsace who ended up smothered in his own fat, I believe. People said that he used to torture slackers by sitting on their chests. They also said that he had a protruding Adam’s apple because the body of an Arab he’d swallowed was lodged in his throat. I still have memories from that period: an old priest who sometimes brought us food, the jute sack my mother made into a kind of smock for me, the semolina dishes we’d eat on special occasions. I don’t want to tell you about our troubles, because at that time they were a matter only of hunger, not of injustice. In the evening, we kids would play marbles, and if one of us didn’t show up the following day that would mean that he was dead—and we’d keep on playing. It was a period of epidemics and famines. Rural life was hard. It revealed what the cities kept hidden—namely, that the country was starving to death. I was afraid, especially at night, of hearing the bleak sound of men’s footsteps, men who knew that Mama had no protector. Those were nights of waking and watchfulness, which I spent glued to her side. I was well and truly the <em>uld el-assas</em>, the night watchman’s son and heir.</p><p>Strangely, we gravitated around Hadjout and the vicinity for years before we were able to settle down behind solid walls. Who knows how much cunning and patience it cost Mama to find us a house, the one she still lives in today? I don’t. In any case, she figured out what the right move was: she got herself hired as a housekeeper and waited, with me perched on her back, for Independence. The truth of the matter is that the house had belonged to a family of settlers who left in a hurry, and we ended up taking it over during the first days of Independence. It’s a three-room house with wallpapered walls, and in the courtyard a dwarf lemon tree that stares at the sky. There are two little sheds beside the house, and a wooden doorframe. I remember the vine that provided shade along the walls, and the strident peeping of the birds. Before we moved into the main house, Mama and I resided in an adjacent shack, which a neighbor uses as a grocery store today. You know, I don’t like to remember that period. It’s as if I were forced to beg for pity.</p><p>When I was fifteen, I found a job as a farm laborer. Work was rare, and the nearest farm was three kilometres from the village. Do you know how I got the job? I’m going to confess: one day I got up before dawn and I let the air out of another worker’s bicycle tires so that I could show up earlier than he did and take his place. Yes, indeed, that’s hunger for you! I don’t want to play the victim, but it took us years to cross the dozen or so metres that separated our hovel from the settlers’ house, years of tiny, fettered steps, as if we were slogging through mud or quicksand in a nightmare. I believe more than ten years passed before we finally got our hands on that house and declared it liberated: our property! Yes, yes, we acted like everybody else during the first days of freedom: we broke down the door, took the tableware and the candlesticks. But where was I? It’s a long story, and I’m getting a bit lost.</p><p>After Musa’s murder, while we were still living in Algiers, my mother converted her anger into a long, spectacular period of mourning that won her the<span data-page="page_5"></span> sympathy of the neighbor women and a kind of legitimacy that allowed her to go out on the street, mingle with men, work in other people’s houses, sell spices, and do housework, without running the risk of being judged. Her femininity had died and, with it, men’s suspicions. I saw little of her during that time. I’d spend entire days waiting for her while she walked all over the city, conducting her investigation into Musa’s death, questioning people who knew him, recognized him, or had crossed his path for the last time in the course of that year, 1942. Some neighbor ladies kept me fed, and the other children in the neighborhood showed me the respect you give to seriously ill or broken people. I found my status—as “the dead man’s brother”—almost agreeable; in fact, I didn’t begin to suffer from it until I was approaching adulthood, when I learned to read and realized what an unjust fate had befallen my brother, who died in a book.</p><p>After his passing, the way my time was structured changed. I lived my life in absolute freedom for exactly forty days. The funeral didn’t take place until then, you see. The neighborhood imam must have found the whole thing disturbing. For Musa’s body was never found, and missing persons rarely have funerals. . . . My mother looked for my brother everywhere—in the morgue, at the police station in Belcourt—and she knocked on every door. To no avail. Musa had vanished; he was absolutely, perfectly, incomprehensibly dead. There had been two of them in that place of sand and salt, him and his killer only. Of the murderer we knew almost nothing. He was <em>el-roumi</em>, the foreigner, “the stranger.” People in the neighborhood showed my mother his picture in the newspaper, but for us he was just like all the other colonists who’d grown fat on so many stolen harvests. There was nothing special about him, except for the cigarette stuck in the corner of his mouth; his features were instantly forgotten, confused with those of his people.</p><p>My mother visited cemeteries, pestered my brother’s former comrades. Her efforts were in vain, but they revealed her talent for idle chatter, and her mourning period evolved into a surprising comedy, a marvellous act she put on and refined until it became a masterpiece. Virtually widowed for the second time, she turned her personal drama into a kind of business that required all who came near her to make an effort of compassion. She invented a range of illnesses in order to gather the whole tribe of female neighbors around her whenever she had so much as a migraine headache. She often pointed a finger at me as if I were an orphan, and she withdrew her affection from me very quickly, replacing it with the narrowed eyes of suspicion and the hard gaze of admonition. Oddly enough, I was treated like the dead brother, and Musa like a survivor whose coffee was prepared fresh at the end of the day, whose bed was made for him, and whose footsteps were listened for, even when he was coming from very far away, from downtown Algiers and the neighborhoods that were closed to us at the time. I was condemned to a secondary role because I had nothing in particular to offer. I felt guilty for being alive but also responsible for a life that wasn’t my own. I was the guardian, the <em>assas</em>, like my father, watching over another body.</p><p>I also remember that weird funeral: crowds of people; discussions lasting well into the night; us children, attracted by the light bulbs and the many candles; and then an empty grave and a prayer for the departed. After the religious waiting period of forty days, Musa had been declared dead—swept away by the sea—and therefore, absurdly, the service that Islam prescribes for the drowned was performed. Then everyone left, except my mother and me.</p><p>It was morning. I was cold even under the blanket, shivering. Musa had been dead for weeks. I heard the outside sounds—a passing bicycle, old Tawi’s coughing, the squeaking of chairs, the raising of iron shutters. In my head, every voice corresponded to a woman, a time of life, a concern, a mood, or even to the kind of wash that was going to be hung out that day. There was a knock at our door. Some women had come to visit Mama. I knew the script by heart: a silence, followed by sobs, then hugs and kisses; still more tears; then one of the women would lift the curtain that divided the room, look at me, smile distractedly, and grab the coffee jar or something else. The scene continued until sometime around noon. Only in the afternoon, after the ritual of the scarf soaked in orange-flower water and wrapped around her head, after some interminable moaning and a long, very long silence, would Mama remember me and take me in her arms. But I knew that it was Musa she wanted to find there, not me. And I let her do it.</p><p>As I said, Musa’s body was never found.</p><p>Consequently, my mother imposed on me a strict duty of reincarnation. For instance, as soon as I had grown a little, she made me wear my dead brother’s clothes—his undershirts, his dress shirts, his shoes—even though they were still<span data-page="page_6"></span> too big for me, and that went on until I wore them out. I was forbidden to wander away from her, to walk by myself, to sleep in unknown places, and, before we left Algiers, to venture anywhere near the beach. The sea was off-limits. Mama taught me to fear its mildest suction—so effectively that even today, when I’m walking along the shore, where the waves die, the sensation of the sand giving way under my feet feels like the beginning of drowning. Deep down, Mama wanted to believe that the water was the culprit, that the water had carried off her son’s body. My body, therefore, became the only visible trace of her dead son, which likely explained my physical cowardice—which I, of course, compensated for with a restless but, to be frank, ambitionless intelligence. I was sick a lot. And throughout every illness she’d watch over my body with an almost sinful attention, with a concern tainted by a vague undercurrent of incest. She’d reproach me for getting the smallest scratch, as if I had wounded Musa himself.</p><p>And so I was deprived of the healthy joys of youth, the awakening of the senses, the clandestine eroticism of adolescence. I grew silent and ashamed. I avoided hammams and playing with others, and in the winter I wore djellabahs that hid me from people’s eyes. It took me years to become reconciled with my body, with myself. In fact, to this day I don’t know if I have. I’ve always had a stiffness in my bearing, owing to my guilt at being alive. Like a true night watchman’s son, I sleep very little, and badly—I panic at the idea of closing my eyes and falling I don’t know where without my name to anchor me. Mama gave me her fears, and Musa his corpse. What could a teen-ager do, trapped like that between death and his mother?</p><p>I remember the rare days when I accompanied my mother as she walked the streets of Algiers in search of information about my vanished brother. She would set a brisk pace and I’d follow, my eyes fixed on her haik so as not to lose her. And thus an amusing intimacy was created, the source of a brief period of tenderness between us. With her widow’s language and her calculated whimpering, Mama collected clues and mixed genuine information with scraps from the previous night’s dream. I can still see her with one of Musa’s friends, clinging fearfully to his arm as we passed through French neighborhoods, where we were considered intruders.</p><p>Yes, we made an odd couple, roaming the streets of the capital like that! Much later, after the story of Musa’s death had become a famous book and departed the country, leaving my mother and me in oblivion—even though we were the ones who had suffered the loss of the book’s sacrificial victim—I often went back in memory to the Belcourt neighborhood and our investigations, remembering how we’d scrutinize windows and building façades, looking for clues. One day, Mama finally got a fragile lead she could follow: someone had given her an address. Now Algiers seemed a frightening labyrinth whenever we ventured outside our perimeter, but Mama walked without stopping, passing a cemetery and a covered market and some cafés, through a jungle of stares and cries and car horns, until she finally stopped short and gazed at a house across the street from us. It was a fine day, and I was lagging behind her, panting, because she’d been walking very fast. All along the way, I’d heard her muttering insults and threats, praying to God and her ancestors, or maybe to the ancestors of God himself, who knows. I resented her excitement a little, without knowing exactly why. It was a two-story house, and the windows were closed—nothing else to report. The <em>roumis</em> in the street were eying us with great distrust.</p><p>We remained there in silence for a long time. An hour, maybe two, and then Mama, without so much as a glance at me, crossed the street and knocked resolutely on the door. An old Frenchwoman opened it. The light behind Mama made it hard for the lady to see her, but she put her hand over her brow like a visor and examined her visitor carefully, and I watched uneasiness, incomprehension, and finally terror come over her face. She turned red, fear rose in her eyes, and she seemed about to scream. Then I realized that Mama was reeling off the longest string of curses she’d ever uttered. Agitated, the lady at the door tried to push Mama away. I was afraid for Mama; I was afraid for us. All of a sudden, the Frenchwoman collapsed unconscious on her doorstep. People had stopped to watch. I could make out their shadows behind me—little groups had formed here and there—and then someone shouted the word “Police!” A woman cried out in Arabic, telling Mama to hurry, to get away fast. That was when Mama turned around and shouted, as if she were addressing all the <em>roumis</em> in the world, “The sea will swallow you all!” Then she grabbed me, and we took off running, like a pair of maniacs. Once we had got back home, she barricaded herself behind a wall of silence. We went to bed without supper. Later, she would explain<span data-page="page_7"></span> to the neighbors that she had found the house where the murderer grew up and had insulted his grandmother, maybe, and then she’d add, “Or one of his relatives, or at least a <em>roumia</em> like him.”</p><p>The murderer had lived somewhere in a neighborhood not far from the sea. There was a building with a vaguely sagging upper story above a café, poorly protected by a few trees, but its windows were always closed in those days, so I think Mama had insulted an anonymous old Frenchwoman with no connection to our tragedy. Long after Independence, a new tenant opened the shutters and eliminated the last possibility of a mystery. This is all to tell you that no one we met was ever able to say that he’d crossed the murderer’s path or looked into his eyes or understood his motives. Mama questioned a great many people, so many that I eventually felt ashamed for her, as if she were begging for money and not clues. Her investigations served as a ritual to lessen her pain, and her comings and goings in the French part of the city turned, however incongruously, into opportunities for extended walks.</p><p>I recall the day when we finally arrived at the sea. The sky was gray, and a few metres away from me was our family’s huge and mighty adversary, the thief of Arabs, the killer of young men in overalls. It was indeed the last witness on Mama’s list. As soon as we got there, she pronounced Sidi Abderrahman’s name and then, several times, the name of God, ordered me to stay away from the water, sat down, and massaged her aching ankles. I stood behind her, a child facing the immensity of both the crime and the horizon. What did I feel? Nothing except the wind on my skin—it was autumn, the autumn after the murder. I tasted the salt. I saw the dense gray waves. That’s all. The sea was like a wall with soft, moving edges. Far off, up in the sky, there were some heavy white clouds. I started picking up things that were lying on the sand: seashells, glass shards, bottle caps, clumps of dark seaweed. The sea told us nothing, and Mama remained motionless on the shore, like someone bending over a grave. Finally, she stood up straight, looked attentively right and left, and said, in a hoarse voice, “God’s curse be upon you!” Then she took me by the hand and led me away from the sand, as she’d done so often before. I followed her.</p><p>One more memory: the visits to the hereafter, on Fridays, at the summit of Bab-el-Oued. I’m talking about the El-Kettar Cemetery, otherwise known as “the Perfumery,” because of the former jasmine distillery situated nearby. Every other Friday, we’d go to the cemetery to visit Musa’s empty grave. Mama would whimper, which I found uncalled for and ridiculous, because there was nothing in that hole. I remember the mint that grew in the cemetery, the trees, the winding aisles, Mama’s white haik against the too blue sky. Everybody in the neighborhood knew that the hole was empty, knew that Mama filled it with her prayers and her inventions. That cemetery was the place where I awakened to life. It was where I became aware that I had a right to the fire of my presence in the world—yes, I had a right to it!—despite the absurdity of my condition, which consisted of pushing a corpse to the top of a hill before it rolled back down, endlessly. Those days, the cemetery days, were the first days when I turned to pray not toward Mecca but toward the world. Nowadays, I’m working on better versions of those prayers. But back then I had discovered, in some obscure way, a form of sensuality. How can I explain it to you? The angle of the light, the vigorous blue of the sky, and the wind woke in me something more disturbing than the simple satisfaction you feel after a need has been met. Remember, I wasn’t quite ten years old, and therefore still clinging to my mother’s breast. That cemetery had the attraction of a playground for me. My mother never guessed that it was there that I definitively buried Musa one day, mutely shouting at him to leave me alone. Precisely there, in El-Kettar, an Arab cemetery. Today, it’s a dirty place, inhabited by fugitives and drunks. I’m told that marble is stolen from the tombs each and every night. You want to go and see it? It’ll be a waste of time—you won’t find anyone there, and you especially won’t find a trace of that grave, which was dug like the prophet Yusuf’s well. If the body’s not in it, you can’t prove anything. Mama wasn’t entitled to anything. Not to apologies before Independence, not to a pension afterward.</p><p>After Musa died, my mother turned fierce, in a way. Try to imagine the woman: snatched away from her tribe, given in marriage to a husband who didn’t know her and who hastened to get away from her, the mother of two sons, one dead and one a child too silent to give her the proper cues, a woman who lost two men and was forced to work for <em>roumis</em> in order to survive. She developed a taste for<span data-page="page_final"></span> her martyrdom. Did I love her? Of course. For us, a mother is half the world. But I’ve never forgiven her for the way she treated me. She resented me for a death she felt I had somehow refused to undergo, and so she punished me. I don’t know—I had a lot of resistance in me, and she could sense that, in a confused sort of way.</p><p>Mama knew the art of making ghosts live and, conversely, was very good at annihilating those close to her, drowning them in the monstrous torrents of her made-up tales. She can’t read, but I promise you, my friend, she would have told you the story of our family and my brother better than I can. She lied not out of a desire to deceive but in order to correct reality and to mitigate the absurdity that had struck her world and mine. Musa’s passing destroyed her, but, paradoxically, it also introduced her to the morbid pleasure of a never-ending mourning. For a long time, not a year passed without my mother swearing that she’d found Musa’s body, heard his breathing or his footsteps, recognized the imprint of his shoes. And, for a long time, this made me feel impossibly ashamed of her—and, later, it pushed me to learn a language that could serve as a barrier between her frenzies and me. Yes, the language. The one I read, the one I speak today, the one that’s not hers. Hers is rich, full of imagery, vitality, sudden jolts, and improvisations, but not too big on precision. Mama’s grief lasted so long that she needed a new idiom in which to express it. In her language, she spoke like a prophetess, recruited extemporaneous mourners, and cried out against the double outrage that had consumed her life: a husband swallowed up by air, a son by water. I had to learn a different language. To survive. After my presumed fifteenth birthday, when we withdrew to Hadjout, I became a stern and serious scholar. Books gradually enabled me to name things, to organize the world with my own words.</p><p>In Hadjout, I also discovered trees and a sky that I could almost reach. Eventually I was admitted to a school where there were a few other little natives like me. That helped to distract me from Mama and her disturbing way of watching me eat and grow, as if she were fattening me up for a sacrifice. Those were strange years. I felt alive when I was on the street, in school, or at the farms where I worked, but going home meant stepping into a grave or, at least, falling ill. Mama and Musa were both waiting for me, each in a different way, and I was almost obliged to explain myself, to justify the hours I’d wasted not sharpening the knife of our family’s vengeance. In the neighborhood, our shack was considered a sinister place. The other children referred to me as “the widow’s son.” People were afraid of Mama, but they also suspected her of having committed a crime, a bizarre crime—otherwise, why leave the city to come here and wash dishes for the <em>roumis</em>? We must have presented a peculiar spectacle when we arrived in Hadjout: a mother hiding her carefully folded newspaper clippings in her bosom, a teen-ager with his eyes on his bare feet, and some raggedy baggage. Right around that time, the murderer was climbing the last steps of his fame. It was the nineteen-fifties; the Frenchwomen wore short, flowered dresses, and the sun bit at their breasts. ♦</p><p><em>(Translated, from the French, by John Cullen.)</em></p>	Kamel Daoud	April 6, 2015 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/musa	Albert Camus	Books	Brothers	Crimes	Death	Mothers	Unnamed	First	Death
My Life Is a Joke	<p>When <span data-page="page_1"></span>I died, there was no one around to see it. I died all alone. It’s fine. Some people think it’s a great tragedy to die all alone, with no one around to see it. My high-school boyfriend wanted to marry me, because he thought the most important thing to have in life was a witness. To marry your high-school girlfriend, and have her with you all through life—that is a lot of witnessing. Everything important would be witnessed by one woman. I didn’t like his idea of what a wife was for—someone to just hang around and watch your life unfold. But I understand him better now. It is no small thing to have someone who loves you see your life, and discuss it with you every night.</p><p>Instead of marrying him, I married no one. We broke up. I lived alone. I had no children. I was the only witness to my life, while he found a woman to marry, then had a child using fertility. Her family of origin is large and lives near them—same with his family of origin. I visited them one time, and at his birthday dinner there were thirty relatives and close friends, including their only child. We were at the home of his wife’s parents, in the small coastal town where they were building their lives. He got exactly what he wanted. He has thirty reliable witnesses. Even if half of them die or move away or come to hate him, he still has fifteen. When he dies, he will be surrounded by a loving family, who will remember when he still had hair. Who will remember every night that he came home stinking drunk and yelling. Who will remember his every failure, and love him in spite of it all. When all his witnesses die, his life will be over. When his son is dead, and his son’s wife is dead, and the children of his son are also dead, the life of my first boyfriend will be through.</p><p>When I drew my last breath, no one saw me. The car that hit me drove quickly away, and a driver stopped to carry me out of the center of the road. I was already dead when he carried me, so I can say I died alone.</p><p>Now, you can probably tell that I’m lying. If I really am O.K. with the fact that no one I loved witnessed my death, why did I come all the way back here from the dead? Why did I put on the flesh of my body, and the clothes I wore my last day on earth? Why did I resume the voice I spoke with when I was living, and return to the weight I was at the time of my death? I even washed the dirt out of my eyes and my hair, settled my teeth in the places in my mouth where they were before they got knocked out. Why did I bother doing that? It was a lot of work. I could have stayed in the ground for eternity. I could have stayed there, disintegrating, if I felt that my life was resolved. If there had not been a twinge of anxiety in me that something still needed to be said, I would still be in the ground.</p><p>Here is the thing: I was a joke, and my life was a joke. The last man I loved—not my high-school boyfriend—told me this during our final fight. I was thirty-four at the time. During the fight, as I was trying to explain my version of things, he shouted, “You are a joke, and your life is a joke!”</p><p>The night before, we loved each other still. We went to bed at the same time, and, as he read a popular crime novel on his phone, I fell asleep on my pillow, gently touching his arm. A few days later, I died. It has taken me since that time—four years—to understand the full significance of what he said: that I was a joke and my life was a joke. At the moment he said it, I didn’t know how to reply. I was so hurt, I just began bawling. This only proved to him that he was correct. I stared at him with an open mouth. Of course, I was used to his cruelties by then, but still it hurt.</p><p>When I received your invitation to come speak here tonight—Didn’t you know I had died? You did not—when I received your invitation, at first I thought, No, I cannot come. The truth is I had no reason to. But then a few months later I wrote you a note: I’ll come if you’ll pay to dig me up. If you’ll pay to fly my corpse across North America, from where I am buried, and wheel me to the mike stand, then yes, I’ll come. As I flew, I worked so hard to keep in my dead brain what I wanted to say—it was the whole reason I’d said yes. I had something important to declare. What was it? Have I said it already? Thoughts slip from a dead brain so quickly. I can’t remember if I said it.</p><p>Lying there under the ground, salt and soil and sweat and worms and seedlings and saplings and the bones of<span data-page="page_2"></span> dried birds collecting in my mouth, and my blood caked dry, and my toes curled up, and my brain filled with hair and the feathers of birds, and the little white balls of whatever it is that sometimes specks the soil—those little Styrofoam balls—and the shit of dogs, and the piss of skunks, and the seedlings and the saplings and the acorns and the raisins; it is so amazing I could think down there, in that total, wet darkness. You never know, lying in the ground, what your niggling thought will be. You can take only one thought with you to the grave, and invariably it is a thought that bugs you, something that must be thought all the way through to the end before you find your peace. The thought I took was of a man I loved saying, “You are a joke, and your life is a joke.” It cleaved to my head and my muscles and my bones, until I was nothing but those words. When my life collapsed inward—which is what death is, life collapsing deep into itself—that phrase remained outside the collapsing; it became a thing separate from me. And, because it was separate from me, I could take it with me—it was the only thing I had.</p><p>Could I have a glass of water, please? Where is my water? I am parched and I am dead. Tomorrow I will be on an airplane home, down there with all the luggage, peace in my bones, having declared what I came here to declare—what I realized when I was underground. Then I will be dead for the rest of eternity, never having to brush myself off.</p><p>The man who said I was a joke and my life was a joke—he may not have been there in my final moments, witnessing my final breath, but what I realized was: he foretold my death. He could only have foretold it by seeing me to my core—by having been my soul’s witness. When he said those awful words, he witnessed me into the future, a future he knew I would meet. During our fight, I tried to convince him that he was wrong. “I’m not a joke!” I cried. “You’re the joke! You’re the joke!”</p><p>When a person slips on a banana peel and dies, then her life is a joke. Slipping on a banana peel is not how I died. When a person walks into a bar with a rabbi, a priest, and a nun, and that is how she dies, then her life is a joke. That is not how I died. When a person is a chicken who crosses the road to get to the other side, and that is how she dies, then her life is a joke. Well, that is how I died—as a chicken crossing the road to get to the other side.</p><p>When I crossed the road that day, it was to the other side I was heading—that was how much despair I felt, our fight still in my mind. Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the other side. A suicide. The other side is death. Everyone knows that, right?</p><p>I scurried out in front of that rusty old car, and smashed myself into the metal, my teeth pushed back into my throat by the fender, my chest completely run over.</p><p>I didn’t come here to depress you. I came here to tell you a joke. Or, rather, to show you a joke. Me! And to brag that I was witnessed. That first boyfriend of mine—he doesn’t live far from here. Perhaps he is in the audience, listening? Having a beer? I hope he’s here! My life and death were witnessed, I tell you! Witnessed and foretold! You did not fare any better than me. It seems both of us won, in the end.</p><p>What a chicken I was. I couldn’t bear any aspect of living. Especially that old custom: that you have to live a better life than everyone else.</p><p>What is the other side like, you may be wondering. Since I’m here, I might as well tell you: it’s a ridiculous place where everyone is always laughing. It’s like something I experienced once, on a transcontinental flight. This woman beside me laughed at every dumb joke in whatever show she was watching, literally every joke the show made. Then she watched another show, then another one. Her laughter filled our row of seats. She didn’t stop laughing from takeoff to landing. How a person’s laughter can make you hate her! Don’t the laughers of the world know this? Do they think it makes them lovable? Who likes to hear someone laughing to herself, headphones on, while staring at a screen? Probably the same people who like to listen to strangers fuck behind a hotel wall.</p><p>Over there on the other side, it’s like that all the time—the dogs laugh, the trees laugh, everyone laughs—whether there’s anything funny or not. I practiced this speech on the other side, before an audience of sixteen people, and it took four hours, from beginning to end, as I waited after saying each sentence for the laughter to subside. Here on earth it is different, of course. The quiet of the living is one of the great reliefs. Is death the same for everyone, or is this laughing world a<span data-page="page_final"></span> death made just for me? How can I know for sure?</p><p>Does anything I’m saying make any sense? I’m self-conscious about my speaking. Does my voice sound all right? When you are dead, it’s difficult to carry a thought. My head feels stuffed with cotton batting; my eyes feel stuffed with cotton balls; my ears feel plugged up with cotton. It is hard to think, to string meaning to meaning. I did not come here to tell you I love you. Is that what you think I am saying? I only loved two men ever. One of them wanted to marry me, and the other thought my life was a joke. My first boyfriend found himself a witness, and I have come to declare that I found one, too. I won, you see? I won! I won the best thing a person can win—to be seen! I declare it here today. It’s the only reason I crawled into my flesh to stand here before you—a joke on this stage. His words no longer hurt me. They make me feel so proud.</p><p>Why did the chicken cross the road? That’s me. I am the chicken. And I got to the other side. He knew this would happen when he spoke those words. How beautiful to be seen. ♦</p>	Sheila Heti	May 11, 2015 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/11/my-life-is-a-joke	Books	Boyfriends	Breakups	Couples	Death	Fights	Unnamed	First	Death
One Minus One	<p>The <span data-page="page_1"></span>moon hangs low over Texas. The moon is my mother. She is full tonight, and brighter than the brightest neon; there are folds of red in her vast amber. Maybe she is a harvest moon, a Comanche moon, I do not know. I have never seen a moon so low and so full of her own deep brightness. My mother is six years dead tonight, and Ireland is six hours away and you are asleep.</p><p>I am walking. No one else is walking. It is hard to cross Guadalupe; the cars come fast. In the Community Whole Food Store, where all are welcome, the girl at the checkout asks me if I would like to join the store’s club. If I pay seventy dollars, my membership, she says, will never expire, and I will get a seven-per-cent discount on all purchases.</p><p>Six years. Six hours. Seventy dollars. Seven per cent. I tell her I am here for a few months only, and she smiles and says that I am welcome. I smile back. I can still smile. If I called you now, it would be half two in the morning; you could easily be awake.</p><p>If I called, I could go over everything that happened six years ago. Because that is what is on my mind tonight, as though no time had elapsed, as though the strength of the moonlight had by some fierce magic chosen tonight to carry me back to the last real thing that happened to me. On the phone to you across the Atlantic, I could go over the days surrounding my mother’s funeral. I could go over all the details as though I were in danger of forgetting them. I could remind you, for example, that you wore a white shirt at the funeral. It must have been warm enough not to wear a jacket. I remember that I could see you when I spoke about her from the altar, that you were over in the side aisle, on the left. I remember that you, or someone, said that you had parked your car almost in front of the cathedral because you had come late from Dublin and could not find parking anywhere else. I know that you moved your car before the hearse came after Mass to take my mother’s coffin to the graveyard, with all of us walking behind. You came to the hotel once she was in the ground, and you stayed for a meal with me and Suzie, my sister. Joe, her husband, must have been near, and Cathal, my brother, but I don’t remember what they did when the meal was over and the crowd had dispersed. I know that as the meal came to an end a friend of my mother’s, who noticed everything, came over and looked at you and whispered to me that it was nice that my friend had come. She used the word “friend” with a sweet, insinuating emphasis. I did not tell her that what she had noticed was no longer there, was part of the past. I simply said, yes, it was nice that you had come.</p><p>You know that you are the only person who shakes his head in exasperation when I insist on making jokes and small talk, when I refuse to be direct. No one else has ever minded this as you do. You are alone in wanting me always to say something that is true. I know now, as I walk toward the house I have rented here, that if I called and told you that the bitter past has come back to me tonight in these alien streets with a force that feels like violence, you would say that you are not surprised. You would wonder only why it has taken six years.</p><p>I was living in New York then, the city about to enter its last year of innocence. I had a new apartment there, just as I had a new apartment everywhere I went. It was on Ninetieth and Columbus. You never saw it. It was a mistake. I think it was a mistake. I didn’t stay there long—six or seven months—but it was the longest I stayed anywhere in those years or the years that followed. The apartment needed to be furnished, and I spent two or three days taking pleasure in the sharp bite of buying things: two easy chairs that I later sent back to Ireland; a leather sofa from Bloomingdale’s, which I eventually gave to one of my students; a big bed from 1-800-Mattres; a table and some chairs from a place downtown; a cheap desk from the thrift shop.</p><p>And all those days—a Friday, a Saturday, and a Sunday, at the beginning of September—as I was busy with delivery times, credit cards, and the whiz of taxis from store to store, my mother was dying and no one could find me. I had no cell phone, and the phone line in the apartment had not been connected. I used the pay phone on the corner if I needed to make calls. I gave the delivery companies a friend’s phone number, in case they had to let me know when they would come with my furniture. I phoned my friend a few times a day, and she came shopping with me sometimes and she was fun and I enjoyed those<span data-page="page_2"></span> days. The days when no one in Ireland could find me to tell me that my mother was dying.</p><p>Eventually, late on the Sunday night, I slipped into a Kinko’s and went online and found that Suzie had left me message after message, starting three days before, marked “Urgent” or “Are you there” or “Please reply” or “Please acknowledge receipt” and then just “Please!!!” I read one of them, and I replied to say that I would call as soon as I could find a phone, and then I read the rest of them one by one. My mother was in the hospital. She might have to have an operation. Suzie wanted to talk to me. She was staying at my mother’s house. There was nothing more in any of them, the urgency being not so much in their tone as in their frequency and the different titles she gave to each e-mail that she sent.</p><p>I woke her in the night in Ireland. I imagined her standing in the hall at the bottom of the stairs. I would love to say that Suzie told me my mother was asking for me, but she said nothing like that. She spoke instead about the medical details and how she herself had been told the news that our mother was in the hospital and how she had despaired of ever finding me. I told her that I would call again in the morning, and she said that she would know more then. My mother was not in pain now, she said, although she had been. I did not tell her that my classes would begin in three days, because I did not need to. That night, it sounded as though she wanted just to talk to me, to tell me. Nothing more.</p><p>But in the morning when I called I realized that she had put quick thought into it as soon as she heard my voice on the phone, that she had known I could not make arrangements to leave for Dublin late on a Sunday night, that there would be no flights until the next evening; she had decided to say nothing until the morning. She had wanted me to have an easy night’s sleep. And I did, and in the morning when I phoned she said simply that there would come a moment very soon when the family would have to decide. She spoke about <em>the family</em> as though it were as distant as the urban district council or the government or the United Nations, but she knew and I knew that there were just the three of us. We were the family, and there is only one thing that a family is ever asked to decide in a hospital. I told her that I would come home; I would get the next flight. I would not be in my new apartment for some of the furniture deliverers, and I would not be at the university for my first classes. Instead, I would find a flight to Dublin, and I would see her as soon as I could. My friend phoned Aer Lingus and discovered that a few seats were kept free for eventualities like this. I could fly out that evening.</p><p>You know that I do not believe in God. I do not care much about the mysteries of the universe, unless they come to me in words, or in music maybe, or in a set of colors, and then I entertain them merely for their beauty and only briefly. I do not even believe in Ireland. But you know, too, that in these years of being away there are times when Ireland comes to me in a sudden guise, when I see a hint of something familiar that I want and need. I see someone coming toward me, with a soft way of smiling, or a stubborn uneasy face, or a way of moving warily through a public place, or a raw, almost resentful stare into the middle distance. In any case, I went to J.F.K. that evening, and I saw them as soon as I got out of the taxi: a middle-aged couple pushing a trolley that had too much luggage on it, the man looking fearful and mild, as though he might be questioned by someone at any moment and not know how to defend himself, and the woman harassed and weary, her clothes too colorful, her heels too high, her mouth set in pure, blind determination, but her eyes humbly watchful, undefiant.</p><p>I could easily have spoken to them and told them why I was going home and they both would have stopped and asked me where I was from, and they would have nodded with understanding when I spoke. Even the young men in the queue to check in, going home for a quick respite—just looking at their tentative stance and standing in their company saying nothing, that brought ease with it. I could breathe for a while without worry, without having to think. I, too, could look like them, as though I owned nothing, or nothing much, and were ready to smile softly or keep my distance without any arrogance if someone said, “Excuse me,” or if an official approached.</p><p>When I picked up my ticket, and went to the check-in desk, I was told to go to the other desk, which<span data-page="page_3"></span> looked after business class. It occurred to me, as I took my bag over, that it might be airline policy to comfort those who were going home for reasons such as mine with an upgrade, to cosset them through the night with quiet sympathy and an extra blanket or something. But when I got to the desk I knew why I had been sent there, and I wondered about God and Ireland, because the woman at the desk had seen my name being added to the list and had told the others that she knew me and would like to help me now that I needed help.</p><p>Her name was Frances Carey, and she had lived next door to my aunt’s house, where we—myself and Cathal—were left when my father got sick. I was eight years old then. Frances must have been ten years older, but I remember her well, as I do her sister and her two brothers, one of whom was close to me in age. Their family owned the house that my aunt lived in, the aunt who took us in. They were grander than she was and much richer, but she had become friendly with them, and there was, since the houses shared a large back garden and some outhouses, a lot of traffic between the two establishments.</p><p>Cathal was four then, but in his mind he was older. He was learning to read already, he was clever and had a prodigious memory, and was treated as a young boy in our house rather than as a baby; he could decide which clothes to wear each day and what television he wanted to watch and which room he would sit in and what food he would eat. When his friends called at the house, he could freely ask them in, or go out with them. When relatives or friends of my parents called, they asked for him, too, and spoke to him and listened avidly to what he had to say.</p><p>In all the years that followed, Cathal and I never once spoke about our time in this new house with this new family. And my memory, usually so good, is not always clear. I cannot remember, for example, how we got to the house, who drove us there, or what this person said. I know that I was eight years old only because I remember what class I was in at school when I left and who the teacher was. It is possible that this period lasted just two or three months. Maybe it was more. It was not summer, I am sure of that, because Suzie, who remained unscathed by all of this (or so she said, when once, years ago, I asked her if she remembered it), was back at boarding school. I have no memory of cold weather in that house in which we were deposited, although I do think that the evenings were dark early. Maybe it was from September to December. Or the first months after Christmas. I am not sure.</p><p>What I remember clearly is the rooms themselves, the parlor and dining room almost never used and the kitchen, larger than ours at home, and the smell and taste of fried bread. I hated the hot thick slices, fresh from the pan, soaked in lard or dripping. I remember that our cousins were younger than we were and had to sleep during the day, or at least one of them did, and we had to be quiet for hours on end, even though we had nothing to do; we had none of our toys or books. I remember that nobody liked us, either of us, not even Cathal, who, before and after this event, was greatly loved by people who came across him.</p><p>We slept in my aunt’s house and ate her food as best we could, and we must have played or done something, although we never went to school. Nobody did us any harm in that house; nobody came near us in the night, or hit either of us, or threatened us, or made us afraid. The time we were left by our mother in our aunt’s house has no drama attached to it. It was all grayness, strangeness. Our aunt dealt with us in her own distracted way. Her husband was mild, distant, almost good-humored.</p><p>And all I know is that our mother did not get in touch with us once, not once, during this time. There was no letter or phone call or visit. Our father was in the hospital. We did not know how long we were going to be left there. In the years that followed, our mother never explained her absence, and we never asked her if she had ever wondered how we were, or how we felt, during those months.</p><p>This should be nothing, because it resembled nothing, just as one minus one resembles zero. It should be barely worth recounting to you as I walk the empty streets of this city in the desert so far away from where I belong. It feels as though Cathal and I had spent that time in the shadow world, as though we had been quietly lowered into the dark, everything familiar missing, and nothing we did or said could change this. Because no one gave any sign of hating us, it did not<span data-page="page_4"></span> strike us that we were in a world where no one loved us, or that such a thing might matter. We did not complain. We were emptied of everything, and in the vacuum came something like silence—almost no sound at all, just some sad echoes and dim feelings.</p><p>I promise you that I will not call. I have called you enough, and woken you enough times, in the years when we were together and in the years since then. But there are nights now in this strange, flat, and forsaken place when those sad echoes and dim feelings come to me slightly louder than before. They are like whispers, or trapped whimpering sounds. And I wish that I had you here, and I wish that I had not called you all those other times when I did not need to as much as I do now.</p><p>My brother and I learned not to trust anyone. We learned then not to talk about things that mattered to us, and we stuck to this, as much as we could, with a sort of grim stubborn pride, all our lives, as though it were a skill. But you know that, don’t you? I do not need to call you to tell you that.</p><p>At J.F.K. that night, Frances Carey smiled warmly and asked me how bad things were. When I told her that my mother was dying, she said that she was shocked. She remembered my mother so well, she said. She said she was sorry. She explained that I could use the first-class lounge, making it clear, however, in the most pleasant way, that I would be crossing the Atlantic in coach, which was what I had paid for. If I needed her, she said, she could come up in a while and talk, but she had told the people in the lounge and on the plane that she knew me, and they would look after me.</p><p>As we spoke and she tagged my luggage and gave me my boarding pass, I guessed that I had not laid eyes on her for more than thirty years. But in her face I could see the person I had known, as well as traces of her mother and one of her brothers. In her presence—the reminder she offered of that house where Cathal and I had been left all those years ago—I could feel that this going home to my mother’s bedside would not be simple, that some of our loves and attachments are elemental and beyond our choosing, and for that very reason they come spiced with pain and regret and need and hollowness and a feeling as close to anger as I will ever be able to manage.</p><p>Sometime during the night in that plane, as we crossed part of the Western Hemisphere, quietly and, I hope, unnoticed, I began to cry. I was back then in the simple world before I had seen Frances Carey, a world in which someone whose heartbeat had once been mine, and whose blood became my blood, and inside whose body I once lay curled, herself lay stricken in a hospital bed. The fear of losing her made me desperately sad. And then I tried to sleep. I pushed back my seat as the night wore on and kept my eyes averted from the movie being shown, whatever it was, and let the terrible business of what I was flying toward hit me.</p><p>I hired a car at the airport, and I drove across Dublin in the washed light of that early September morning. I drove through Drumcondra, Dorset Street, Mountjoy Square, Gardiner Street, and the streets across the river that led south, as though they were a skin that I had shed. I did not stop for two hours or more, until I reached the house, fearing that if I pulled up somewhere to have breakfast the numbness that the driving with no sleep had brought might lift.</p><p>Suzie was just out of bed when I arrived, and Jim was still asleep. Cathal had gone back to Dublin the night before, she said, but would be down later. She sighed and looked at me. The hospital had phoned, she went on, and things were worse. Your mother, she said, had a stroke during the night, on top of everything else. It was an old joke between us: never “our mother” or “my mother” or “Mammy” or “Mummy,” but “your mother.”</p><p>The doctors did not know how bad the stroke had been, she said, and they were still ready to operate if they thought they could. But they needed to talk to us. It was a pity, she added, that our mother’s specialist, the man who looked after her heart, and whom she saw regularly and liked, was away. I realized then why Cathal had gone back to Dublin—he did not want to be a part of the conversation that we would have with the doctors. Two of us would be enough. He had told Suzie to tell me that whatever we decided would be fine with him.</p><p>Neither of us blamed him. He was the one who had become close to her. He was the one she loved most. Or maybe he was the only one she loved. In those years, anyway. Or maybe that is unfair. Maybe she loved us all, just as<span data-page="page_5"></span> we loved her as she lay dying.</p><p>And I moved, in those days—that Tuesday morning to the Friday night when she died—from feeling at times a great remoteness from her to wanting fiercely, almost in the same moment, my mother back where she had always been, in witty command of her world, full of odd dreams and perspectives, difficult, ready for life. She loved, as I did, books and music and hot weather. As she grew older she had managed, with her friends and with us, a pure charm, a lightness of tone and touch. But I knew not to trust it, not to come close, and I never did. I managed, in turn, to exude my own lightness and charm, but you know that, too. You don’t need me to tell you that, either, do you?</p><p>I regretted nonetheless, as I sat by her bed or left so that others might see her—I regretted how far I had moved away from her, and how far away I had stayed. I regretted how much I had let those months apart from her in the limbo of my aunt’s house, and the years afterward, as my father slowly died, eat away at my soul. I regretted how little she knew about me, as she, too, must have regretted that, although she never complained or mentioned it, except perhaps to Cathal, and he told no one anything. Maybe she regretted nothing. But nights are long in winter, when darkness comes down at four o’clock and people have time to think of everything.</p><p>Maybe that is why I am here now, away from Irish darkness, away from the long, deep winter that settles so menacingly on the place where I was born. I am away from the east wind. I am in a place where so much is empty because it was never full, where things are forgotten and swept away, if there ever were things. I am in a place where there is nothing. Flatness, a blue sky, a soft, unhaunted night. A place where no one walks. Maybe I am happier here than I would be anywhere else, and it is only the poisonous innocence of the moon tonight that has made me want to dial your number and see if you are awake.</p><p>As we drove to see my mother that morning, I could not ask Suzie a question that was on my mind. My mother had been sick for four days now and was lying there maybe frightened, and I wondered if she had reached out her hand to Cathal and if they had held hands in the hospital, if they had actually grown close enough for that. Or if she had made some gesture to Suzie. And if she might do the same to me. It was a stupid, selfish thing I wondered about, and, like everything else that came into my mind in those days, it allowed me to avoid the fact that there would be no time anymore for anything to be explained or said. We had used up all our time. And I wondered if that made any difference to my mother then, as she lay awake in the hospital those last few nights of her life: we had used up all our time.</p><p>She was in intensive care. We had to ring the bell and wait to be admitted. There was a hush over the place. We had discussed what I would say to her so as not to alarm her, how I would explain why I had come back. I told Suzie that I would simply say that I’d heard she was in the hospital and I’d had a few days free before classes began and had decided to come back to make sure that she was O.K.</p><p>“Are you feeling better?” I asked her.</p><p>She could not speak. Slowly and laboriously, she let us know that she was thirsty and they would not allow her to drink anything. She had a drip in her arm. We told the nurses that her mouth was dry, and they said that there was nothing much we could do, except perhaps take tiny drops of cold water and put them on her lips using those special little sticks with cotton-wool tips that women use to put on eye makeup.</p><p>I sat by her bed and spent a while wetting her lips. I was at home with her now. I knew how much she hated physical discomfort; her appetite for this water was so overwhelming and so desperate that nothing else mattered.</p><p>And then word came that the doctors would see us. When we stood up and told her that we would be back, she hardly responded. We were ushered by a nurse with an English accent down some corridors to a room. There were two doctors there; the nurse stayed in the room. The doctor who seemed to be in charge, who said that he would have been the one to perform the operation, told us that he had just spoken to the anesthetist, who had insisted that my mother’s heart would not survive an operation. The stroke did not really matter, he said, although it did not help.</p><p>“I could have a go,” he said, and then immediately apologized for speaking like that. He corrected himself: “I could operate, but she would die on<span data-page="page_6"></span> the operating table.”</p><p>There was a blockage somewhere, he said. There was no blood getting to her kidneys and maybe elsewhere as well—the operation would tell us for certain, but it would probably do nothing to solve the problem. It was her circulation, he said. The heart was simply not beating strongly enough to send blood into every part of her body.</p><p>He knew to leave silence then, and the other doctor did, too. The nurse looked at the floor.</p><p>“There’s nothing you can do then, is there?” I said.</p><p>“We can make her comfortable,” he replied.</p><p>“How long can she survive like this?” I asked.</p><p>“Not long,” he said.</p><p>“I mean, hours or days?”</p><p>“Days. Some days.”</p><p>“We can make her very comfortable,” the nurse said.</p><p>There was nothing more to say. Afterward, I wondered if we should have spoken to the anesthetist personally, or tried to contact our mother’s consultant, or asked that she be moved to a bigger hospital for another opinion. But I don’t think any of this would have made a difference. For years, we had been given warnings that this moment would come, as she fainted in public places and lost her balance and declined. It had been clear that her heart was giving out, but not clear enough for me to have come to see her more than once or twice in the summer—and then when I did come I was protected from what might have been said, or not said, by the presence of Suzie and Jim and Cathal. Maybe I should have phoned a few times a week, or written her letters like a good son. But despite all the warning signals, or perhaps even because of them, I had kept my distance. And as soon as I entertained this thought, with all the regret that it carried, I imagined how coldly or nonchalantly a decision to spend the summer close by, seeing her often, might have been greeted by her, and how difficult and enervating for her, as much as for me, some of those visits or phone calls might have been. And how curtly efficient and brief her letters in reply to mine would have seemed.</p><p>And, as we walked back down to see her, the nurse coming with us, there was this double regret—the simple one that I had kept away, and the other one, much harder to fathom, that I had been given no choice, that she had never wanted me very much, and that she was not going to be able to rectify that in the few days that she had left in the world. She would be distracted by her own pain and discomfort, and by the great effort she was making to be dignified and calm. She was wonderful, as she always had been. I touched her hand a few times in case she might open it and seek my hand, but she never did this. She did not respond to being touched.</p><p>Some of her friends came. Cathal came and stayed with her. Suzie and I remained close by. On Friday morning, when the nurse asked me if I thought she was in distress, I said that I did. I knew that, if I insisted now, I could get her morphine and a private room. I did not consult the others; I knew that they would agree. I did not mention morphine to the nurse, but I knew that she was wise, and I saw by the way she looked at me as I spoke that she knew that I knew what morphine would do. It would ease my mother into sleep and ease her out of the world. Her breathing would come and go, shallow and deep, her pulse would become faint, her breathing would stop, and then come and go again.</p><p>It would come and go until, in that private room late in the evening, it seemed to stop altogether, as, horrified and helpless, we sat and watched her, then sat up straight as the breathing started again, but not for long. Not for long at all. It stopped one last time, and it stayed stopped. It did not start again.</p><p>She was gone. She lay still. We sat with her until a nurse came in and quietly checked her pulse and shook her head sadly and left the room.</p><p>We stayed with her for a while; then, when they asked us to leave, we touched her on the forehead one by one, and we left the room, closing the door. We walked down the corridor as though for the rest of our lives our own breathing would bear traces of the end of hers, of her final struggle, as though our own way of being in the world had just been halved or quartered by what we had seen.</p><p>We buried her beside my father, who had been in the grave waiting for her for thirty-three years. And the next morning I flew back to New York, to my half-furnished apartment on Columbus and Ninetieth, and began my teaching a day later. I understood, just as you might tell me now—if you picked up the phone and found me on the other end of the line, silent at first and then saying that I needed to talk to you—you might tell me that I had over all the years postponed<span data-page="page_final"></span> too much. As I settled down to sleep in that new bed in the dark city, I saw that it was too late now, too late for everything. I would not be given a second chance. In the hours when I woke, I have to tell you that this struck me almost with relief. ♦</p>	Colm Toibin	May 7, 2007 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/05/07/one-minus-one	Airplanes	Brothers	Death	Doctors	Dublin, Ireland	Family, Families	Unnamed	First	Death
Reverend	<p>After <span data-page="page_1"></span>his mother died, Thomas started thinking about his father. All too frequently, while she was dying, there had been talk of her going to meet him in Paradise, returning to the arms of her husband of thirty-two years, who had died thirty-two years before she did. This would be bliss.</p><p>Thomas did not believe in such things, of course, though it was hard not to try to imagine them, if only to savor the impossibility of the idea: the two insubstantial souls greeting each other in the ether, the airy embrace. She had been ninety at death, he sixty. There would be some adjustment for that, presumably, in Heaven. The madness of it confirmed one’s skepticism.</p><p>But even assuming that she <em>had</em> gone to meet him, who was he? Who was he now? Who was he then? Who was my father? Thomas thought. And why was he asking himself these questions now? That wasn’t clear. They weren’t exactly urgent. On the other hand, they weren’t going away. He didn’t feel like doing research, putting his father’s name into Google or delving into archives. He could have looked at his father’s old sermon notes. Thomas’s sister had taken some papers when their mother’s house was sold, after the funeral. The notes would have told him something, reminded him of his father’s handwriting, of the way the man thought. But he didn’t want to do that. The thought of his father’s sermons aroused unpleasant emotions. It was difficult to put his finger on the reason. A sense of embarrassment and irritation. What he wanted, rather, was to assemble a picture of his father as he, Thomas, remembered him. Who was he <em>for me</em>? A son should be able to say what his father was for him. What part of my personality do I owe him? How does this man still simmer in my life? If he does.</p><p>Occasionally, Thomas would tell himself that he regretted not having asked his mother more about his father while she was alive. That would surely have been the moment to undertake this reappraisal. Now all his mother’s memories of his father had died with her. He’d never be able to access them. Yet he didn’t actually regret not asking her. The truth was that for all this chatter about her going to meet him in the beyond, for all her occasional tears when Father was mentioned, Thomas’s mother had spoken very little of his father. Very little. Perhaps the only time his name could reliably be expected to come up was when Thomas and his mother argued over something, usually something of a religious or political nature. Thomas could be provocative, stubborn, and his mother never wanted to lose an argument about things that mattered. Then, between exasperation and amusement, she would say, “You’re just like your father, Thomas. He loved to play devil’s advocate, too!”</p><p>How was this possible? His father had been a clergyman. Thomas couldn’t remember the man expressing a single idea that went against orthodox Christianity. How could Mother remember him playing devil’s advocate? Presumably, in their own private relationship, Father had liked to get her riled, flustered, indignant. And this had been partly, though perhaps not altogether, in fun. “He loved to split hairs, just like you,” Thomas’s mother said, shaking her gray head. She did not say which hairs Father had split, and Thomas had not asked her to expand.</p><p>Why hadn’t Thomas questioned her reticence during her lifetime? It was not that he suspected that there was some secret being hidden from him. It was more as though she’d wanted to keep the man to herself. Perhaps she had been afraid that speaking of Father to Thomas would diminish him. Because Father was so devout and Thomas such a doubter. Speaking about him might have given her son a chance to make some disparaging remark, or simply to show once again that he didn’t believe. To rock the boat. That was a favorite expression of Father’s: Don’t rock the boat! In any event, she had kept whatever there was between them in her heart, to the end. In her bedroom, there was a photo of Thomas’s father as a young man, and on the glass frame below his face she had placed a small square of white paper with a few lines of religious poetry:</p><p>Death hides—</p><p>But it cannot divide.</p><p>Thou art but on</p><p>Christ’s</p><p>Other side.</p><p>Thou with Christ</p><p>And Christ with me</p><p>And so together</p><p>Still are we.</p><p>Thomas respected this carefully preserved bereavement. He didn’t investigate. He knew that when the cancer had gone to his father’s brain he had accused his mother of all kinds of unpleasant things and that this had upset her greatly. Never for one moment did Thomas imagine that there was any truth in those accusations. It was just that the cancer had gone to Dad’s head. And who does one accuse, when accusing, if not one’s wife of thirty years? Thomas knew plenty about that. It even occurred to him that he was thinking about his father now because, in separating from his own wife, he had undone, as it<span data-page="page_2"></span> were, the last thing that his father had done as a clergyman, when he’d married them, Thomas and his wife, holding their ringed hands one above the other and declaring, “Those whom God hath joined together, let no man put asunder.” Recently, in preparation for the divorce, Thomas had had to dig out the marriage certificate with Father’s signature on it. It seemed odd to think that his father’s hand had pressed on that very paper. Thirty-two years ago. His handwriting was scratched and sharp, but not without a certain angular elegance. Thomas examined the certificate for a few minutes, looking at his own signature, his wife’s, his father’s, then put it in an envelope with the other papers, ready for his divorce.</p><p><em>Whore</em>. That was it. Just once his mother had talked about it. They had been speaking about her cancer, he remembered. She was lucky, she said, because hers hadn’t gone to her head. Like poor Dad’s. Then she burst into tears and told Thomas that, in his madness before he died, Father had said all kinds of awful things; he had called her a whore. Shocked, Thomas immediately reassured his mother that it had been the disease speaking. She knew that. In his right mind Dad would never have said such a thing. Later, Thomas realized that she had told him this in order to receive his reassurance before dying herself. Once reassured, she didn’t tell him anything else.</p><p>Edward Sanders was born in Liverpool, on the longest day of the year, in 1920. He’d had two sisters, one definitely younger. Perhaps both had been younger. Thomas could have asked his own brother or sister about this—they were older than him, they might know—but he didn’t want his brother and sister to know that he was thinking about his father. Why not? He didn’t want to pool their collective memories. He didn’t want to have to adjust his views in the light of their knowledge. Vaguely he was aware that Mother had spoken of Father’s being fond of Doris, the youngest sister. But, so far as he could recall, Father had never spoken of her. He had never spoken of his mother, either. All Thomas remembered, from perhaps two visits when he was very small, was a tiny old woman with white wispy hair and a hooked nose.</p><p>Was his father deliberately enigmatic? Edward Sanders had talked once of <em>his</em> father, Thomas’s grandfather. They were on holiday in South Devon, and Father had wanted to visit Plymouth Sound, because his father’s ship had been mothballed there during the Great Depression. Thomas’s grandfather had been a ship’s captain, and Father had spent an unemployed summer with him on that ship, waiting for world commerce to start moving again. It must have been a happy time for him, because he got quite excited as they walked along the shore, pointing out where the ship had been, the landing stage they’d rowed to when they went ashore.</p><p>Thomas had the impression that his father had wanted to become a seaman, too, but had been held back by his poor eyesight. His eyesight was so poor that neither the Army nor the Navy had accepted him. He couldn’t even get a driver’s license. So while his own hero father had fought submarines in the Atlantic, he’d worked in Cammell Laird shipyard, doing technical drawings for marine engines. One of the happiest stories Father liked to tell was about how he was admired for his ability to hit rats with a paperweight in the shipyard workshops. It was strange to think that he couldn’t see well enough to join the Navy or drive a car but was perfectly capable of drawing engines and hitting rats with paperweights.</p><p>Father had never spoken of his reasons for becoming a clergyman. But Thomas did know that his father and mother had initially planned to be missionaries. They had met at missionary training college. They had wanted an adventurous life. It was 1948; they’d just lived through a war, but only on the edge of the action. She had been bombed in London, he in Liverpool. Her father had forbidden her to join the Wrens. His father had been disappointed that his son couldn’t enlist. Now they would fight the good fight another way.</p><p>Thomas’s parents’ marriage, he realized now, was based on a religious mission. They were partners in a task: to make the world a better place by converting people to the faith. That was the logic of their being together. If either of them lost this faith, their marriage would be lost with it. Wouldn’t it? Their life was a life in the Church, for the Church, though, for reasons that were never explained, they hadn’t in the end become missionaries. Perhaps having produced children made them less eligible. The Church didn’t want to be responsible for little white children in Uganda or Indonesia. Maybe we children blocked Father’s career, Thomas thought. We frustrated his ambitions. First the eyesight problem, then his children. He remembered the man’s impatience. His father had no time for chatter. Sometimes he barely took time to eat. He was impatient with Mother, too, impatient to be doing. But doing what? Winning souls for Christ. How strange. And how disappointing for him, then, to have failed first and foremost with two of the three souls under his nose,<span data-page="page_3"></span> Thomas and his older brother.</p><p>He took our salvation for granted, Thomas thought.</p><p>Once he had decided to make the effort, it didn’t take Thomas long to gather these thoughts and type them on his computer. If only because there were so few. Thomas was living in a small flat now, away from his wife, whom he had left some time ago. Away from his children, who were grown up now. They no longer needed him for protection. Only for financial support. Yet he did not feel as though he had really got away. It was as if he had left home to climb a mountain and was now stuck on top of it, bivouacked above the tree line, free, but freezing, with no way forward. Thomas was perplexed. His wife was down in the warm pastures waiting for him. So it seemed. But he wouldn’t go back.</p><p>[cartoon id="a18647"]</p><p>There were memories of infancy and memories of adolescence. There were two or three incidents that seemed important. Watershed moments. During Thomas’s early childhood, his father had seemed busy and happy. He preached and led meetings. First in Manchester, then in Blackpool. He was charismatic and embattled. He liked a fight. His voice was vibrant. He made jokes. He was a leader. People came to him for advice. At breakfast and lunch and dinner he said grace. In the evening, before bed, he said prayers. They were fervent, earnest prayers, the prayers of someone going to Heaven, or to Hell. He wasn’t interested in empty, formal religion. He liked his lamb and his roast beef, his plum pie and his custard. But he was always impatient to be up and doing again. Thomas distinctly remembered his father thrusting his chair back and wiping gravy from his mouth with a white napkin. People said “serviette” then. His father had had a rather slack mouth, poor teeth, but he was always clean-shaven. He was always ready to be meeting people. To be saving their souls. Thomas could actually see the gravy stain on the crumpled napkin as his father hurried off.</p><p>But he couldn’t see his father’s face. Thomas tried and tried, but he couldn’t quite see it. In the small apartment he lived in now, he kept no photos of the past. He had no family heirlooms. What had Father looked like? A thin handsome nose, definitely; sandy hair, but receding; gray-green eyes, very thick spectacles. Father was endlessly cleaning his spectacles, usually with a huge white handkerchief. Thomas could <em>see</em> the vigorous action of the hands rubbing the lenses with the cloth. But he couldn’t put eyes and nose together. He couldn’t remember looking into those eyes, or them looking into his. The handkerchief was in the way.</p><p>Father’s body was easier. Thomas remembered an aura of vulnerability, at once wiry and hunched, tense. But not intimidated. He didn’t keep fit, but rode a bike to visit parishioners. At the church, they hated him, because he had banned the annual crowning of the May Queen. It was paganism, he said; it had nothing to do with Our Lord Jesus Christ and his message of joy and salvation. He hadn’t become a clergyman to perpetuate pagan rituals and crown pretty girls.</p><p>Once, Father took Thomas to a holiday camp with some boys from a reform school. That was frightening. They were wild. They jumped off swings in motion to see who could leap the farthest. They yelled swearwords and made rude gestures. Some of them had been sent to the school for robbery or violence. Father didn’t seem to have any trouble talking to these boys or saving their souls. Perhaps he felt that it was missionary work. He felt fulfilled. If Thomas had sworn or made those gestures, Dad would have been furious.</p><p>It was also scary when Father talked about death and burials. There was a story about a coffin that floated in the muddy water after a storm and another that had to be forced down into the grave, because it was too long. The corpse had been a giant. In the end, Dad and the sexton had had to stand on the coffin to get it underground and even then they buried it at a forty-five-degree angle. It seemed strange to Thomas that his father could laugh at death. It seemed strange when he changed from his ordinary clothes into his robes, the long black cassock and starched white surplice, when he raised his arms outward and upward at the end of the blessing, so that he was like an angel. “May the Lord bless you and keep you!” His voice rang around the brown stones of the church. “May the Lord cause his face to shine upon you!” Later, the same man would chase Thomas and his brother back to bed if they crept down the stairs to spy on guests. “Scalawags!” he yelled. Sometimes he got seriously angry with Thomas’s brother and spanked him. “I <em>will</em> have the last word,” he said. “I will <em>thrash</em> the stubbornness out of you.” It was frightening. But reassuring, too, in a way. Thomas had never been spanked, that he could recall. I was the good boy, he realized. Or the shrewd one.</p><p>When Thomas was nine or ten, his father had had a breakdown. “Nervous breakdown” was the expression they used then. He had been supposed to<span data-page="page_4"></span> preach. The moment had come to go up into the pulpit, but he had been unable to. He had had to go home. Perhaps the pagan people of Blackpool had finally got the better of him. Afterward, Thomas’s family had gone on the longest holiday they ever took together. A month in Devon. They had stayed in an abandoned zoo, of all things, sleeping in old animal houses that had been converted into holiday cabins.</p><p>Soon after Father’s breakdown and that holiday, they had left Blackpool and moved to London. This was one of the watersheds, and, looking back, Thomas realized that his memories of Father from this point on were rather different, rather sadder. The expression “new challenge” was used, though Thomas didn’t know who had said it. Dad was given a new challenge: a big church in a thriving well-to-do suburb of London. People in high places believed in him. He was a man who needed to give energy where energy would be well received. An evangelical cannot thrive in a world of May Queens. Or not for long.</p><p>At school, Thomas had to drop his northern accent to avoid being laughed at. Did Father have to change his accent in the pulpit? To suit the good folk of North London? Thomas had no recollection. Thinking about this now, he found it odd. Life had slipped by unnoticed. Or perhaps he, Thomas, at ten years old, had been so focussed on his new life—the need to make new friends, the new vicarage with the big garden, the bus to school, and later the bus <em>and</em> tube to another school, right in the heart of London—so taken by all this novelty that he had barely noticed his father, who went on preaching in much the same way, it seemed to Thomas, albeit from a different pulpit.</p><p>Did he have any recollection of talking to Father, one on one, during this period, in his adolescence, about anything that mattered? Girls, sex, religion, smoking, drinking? He did not. He really didn’t. What Thomas did remember, though, was the growing antagonism between his father and his brother, and his father’s frustration over his sister’s failure at school. He remembered these things because they had caused him pain. His sister was a good Christian, but not smart. One day, she had run away from school, because she couldn’t face her teachers. Father was angry with her. She locked herself in the bathroom, and he banged on the door with his fists. “You <em>shall</em> come out!” Mother tried to mediate, but she was shocked, too: they hadn’t expected this of his sister. Meanwhile, his brother grew his hair long, smoked cigarettes and dope, drank, had inappropriate girlfriends, and listened to evil music. But he did well in school and could beat Father at chess, which was not easy.</p><p>Thomas saw clearly now how his father had failed to see things clearly then. He had failed to accept that his daughter was not going to do well at school and that his son was not going to be a staunch Christian. He had allowed these entirely ordinary developments to frustrate him beyond measure. He had castigated himself. He saw the failings as his own, because it was unthinkable that they could be God’s. Meanwhile, Thomas did well enough at school and toed the line at church. He was sent to a school some miles away, to keep him from his brother’s evil influence. And his behavior was exemplary. Thomas did not smoke or listen to psychedelic music, and, when he swore, it was out of the earshot of parents and sister.</p><p>Yet even Thomas was not quite what his father wanted. He preferred literature to the sciences, and Father was convinced that the truth lay in the sciences, the sciences and theology. Everything else was wishy-washy humanism. At church, Thomas was more obedient than fervent. He went to church only because he would feel guilty if he didn’t. He would feel he had let his parents down. Of course, he would have preferred it himself if he had felt fervent about church. He would have liked to like his duties. It would have been such a relief. But, try as he might, he didn’t.</p><p>All this was in the air but never talked about. Father could hardly complain, because there was objectively nothing in Thomas’s behavior to complain about. Father could confront Thomas’s sister when she hid in the bathroom instead of going to school. He could confront Thomas’s brother when he was caught smoking at his bedroom window or when he started to paint pictures of naked women and said he wanted to go to art college. For better or for worse, there was a relationship there; there was heat. Father would bang on the bathroom door; he would shout. Sometimes he would even strike Thomas’s brother, then afterward he’d be fearfully friendly, because he had overdone it. He would embrace him, and Thomas’s sister, too.</p><p>But there was nothing he could shout at Thomas about. So, in a way, Thomas didn’t have a relationship with his father, as the others did. Now that he thought about it, Thomas could not remember a single conversation with his father throughout his teens. Nothing. Not one exchange of any import or intimacy at all. When he had found that verse in the Bible, “I know thy<span data-page="page_5"></span> works, that thou art neither cold nor hot,” he knew the words were meant for him. His father was a hot man. His balding dome flamed with color when his anger got the better of him. His brother was a cool customer. “Temper, temper,” he needled their sister. But Thomas was neither. “So then because thou art lukewarm,” the Good Book said, “I will spue thee out of my mouth.” That was how God felt about it. Mr. Lukewarm, Thomas thought. I am Mr. Lukewarm.</p><p>It was a Saturday evening now, and Thomas was alone, sitting at his computer screen. It had been a pleasant enough day—he had gone swimming, shopping, had lunch with a friend. But now he began to feel anxious. Now he began to understand where all this was leading, these reflections that he had avoided for thirty years. The truth was that although he had talked to a lawyer about divorce, although he had got the documents, Thomas still hadn’t quite done the deed. He saw that now. The thought of that final confrontation with his wife, the signing of the documents, pained him. You are marooned, Thomas told himself. Mothballed. For the depression.</p><p>He thought again of that rainy Saturday morning when, short of breath and nauseated, his father had led his younger son in the awesome promise: <em>With this ring . . . with this ring . . . I thee wed . . . I thee wed.</em> First his father’s voice, then his own, as they stood face to face at the bottom of the chancel steps. <em>With my body . . . with my body . . . I thee worship . . . I thee worship.</em> It seemed to Thomas now that that must have been the most intimate moment they had ever known. <em>In the name of the father . . . In the name of the father . . . and of the son . . . and of the son.</em> How old had Father been that day, the day before his cancer was diagnosed, the day of the very last ceremony he would ever perform, not knowing it was the last? Fifty-nine. Dad had been fifty-nine. How old was Thomas now? Fifty-eight.</p><p>Thomas was electrified. This was what he had come back to his father for. To ask himself what the man’s life had been like in his fifties, when the family melodrama was over and the decisive battle lost. But easy does it. Put it all in order, Thomas thought, before jumping to conclusions. Go back. Back back back to adolescence.</p><p>[cartoon id="a18693"]</p><p>The most memorable development that had to do with his father, the most decisive watershed, was the Charismatic Movement. His parents had at first resisted, then succumbed to the excitement. It must have been an evangelical version of the ’68 aberration, the need for upheaval and change. Certainly there was an American influence. Soon Mother and Father were reading out I Corinthians 12 at every opportunity, St. Paul’s account of the gifts of the spirit: there were words of wisdom, gifts of healing, gifts of prophecy. Then, one Sunday morning, the curate raised his arms on the chancel steps and spoke in tongues. It sounded babbled and weird, and the man’s face was ecstatic. This was the baptism in the spirit. Needless to say, many parishioners were disgusted. Then Thomas had heard his father and his mother doing the same thing in their bedroom. Babbling. Then his father had declared in church that he believed in these gifts—it was the Renewal they had all been praying for—and he, too, had spoken in tongues from the chancel steps and raised his arms to Heaven in ecstasy when singing a hymn. Thomas couldn’t remember now which hymn. All hymns at the time had seemed painful to him, laden with sad sentiment, with some sticky emotion that held you back. To sing a hymn was to struggle through warm mud, to feel the impossibility of ever growing up and being free.</p><p>Very soon, the pressure on the children began. They, too, must be baptized in the spirit. They, too, must speak in tongues. It was never declared overtly, but it was obvious that if you weren’t, if you didn’t, then you couldn’t be part of the inner fellowship, the core family. His sister got there in no time at all. In no time at all, she was babbling away and praising God and talking about the Latter Days. It made school exams seem rather less important. Thomas fudged it, of course. Thomas pretended he was on board, but mostly studied for his O levels. His parents wouldn’t want to stop him studying, would they? Thomas did try to see if he could speak in tongues; he might even have liked to, had it come naturally. With all the sincerity he could muster, he asked God for guidance and hazarded a few nonsense words; they were not convincing. Meanwhile, people noticed that he did not raise his hands during the hymns. He couldn’t. All in all, it was getting harder and harder to keep your head down.</p><p>Sitting at his computer screen now, Thomas saw that Father had embraced this heady Charismatic stuff to break a deadlock, to make something happen in his life. He hadn’t been able to go to sea like his own father. He<span data-page="page_6"></span> hadn’t become a missionary in exotic lands. It was true that many souls had been won for Jesus, but then they had drifted away again. People blew hot and cold. The May Queen had been abolished, but no doubt she had returned after the reforming vicar had grown too depressed and disheartened to climb the pulpit stairs. There had been the new challenge in London, and he had risen to it—he had done well, the congregation had flourished—but his daughter had failed at school, his older son was an atheist, a smoker, and a libertine, and his youngest child a mere conformist, a cowardly sail-trimmer.</p><p>Father had written a book in those years, on the Holy Trinity, but it had not been accepted. Or, rather, it had been accepted, but only by some minor publisher, not the publisher he’d wanted. It had not made an impression. Exactly what was in the book Thomas didn’t know. His father hadn’t talked about it, though Thomas was not so stupid, even in his mid-teens, that you couldn’t talk to him about a book. So if Father hadn’t talked about his book on the Holy Trinity it was because he was scared of exposing his ideas to his son’s skepticism. Or maybe he didn’t want to push this lukewarm lad into a position where he would have to declare himself. Either way, they hadn’t spoken about it. They hadn’t spoken about anything. Then suddenly this mad wave of enthusiasm was flowing through the church; there was talk of healing and the spiritual power to transform the world. Frustrated, Thomas’s father had gone for it.</p><p>To prove the worth of a weapon you must use it. For six months, a year, the tension in the family soared. They all became more and more themselves. Violently, dangerously themselves. His father prayed and prophesied. His sister was a shrill echo. His brother made fun, hissing and sniggering like a demon. His mother wept; this unkindness would bring her down with gray hairs to her grave. In response, Thomas was intensely well behaved. He hid in his good behavior. In his room, he hung posters of football teams and tinkered with old valve radios. If he could have become invisible, he would. From downstairs came the sound of his sister banging out “Onward, Christian Soldiers” on the piano. Very soon, things would come to a head.</p><p>In his small flat, Thomas had put on the kettle for tea. Now he changed his mind and poured himself a beer. He honestly couldn’t recall the details, exactly how or why it had happened, but one evening, in the lounge, around midnight, they exorcised his brother. Thomas was fifteen. His brother had come home late. Perhaps smelling of dope or drink. From his bedroom, Thomas heard shouting and started to go downstairs. The lounge door was closed. A pale-green door. From behind it came shouts and the chants of prayers, the piano, a hymn. “Yes, Lord, yes!” And his brother was shouting, too. “Leave me alone! Get your hands off me! Let me go! You’re all fucking crazy!”</p><p>Thomas stood on the stairs, looking at the pale-green paint on the door, listening. His whole family was in there. His father, his mother, his sister, his brother. The curate, too, by the sound of it. The loathsome curate with his ecstatic babble. They were all there, behind that door in that room, where a real drama was taking place. The drama between people who are hot and people who are cold.</p><p>Thomas was outside.</p><p>Thomas had not rushed down the last steps, burst into the room, and yelled at them to stop this nonsense.</p><p>Thomas was young. He was afraid. He was excluded. He was not really on anyone’s side. He didn’t want to be like his parents, but he didn’t like the way his brother provoked them. Because thou art lukewarm I will spue thee out of my mouth.</p><p>Was this, Thomas wondered, why he was on his own now, forty and more years later, on a Saturday night, bivouacked on a metaphorical mountainside, with no one beside him? Because he was lukewarm? And if it was, was it really a problem? Thomas rather liked his apartment, didn’t he, and his quiet cold evenings.</p><p>When the exorcism had failed, when Thomas’s brother wasn’t purged or broken but continued to be who he had always been, when the desired transformation did <em>not</em> take place and life returned, if not to normal, then certainly to monotony and flatness, as when a flood withdraws after the tempest, what had his father’s life been like then? How had he been able to go on, to traverse day by day the grim domestic mudscape that was left? The nine sad mothballed years before the cancer choked him?</p><p>A year after the exorcism, Thomas had gone on a last holiday with his parents, to Deal, on the south coast. This was where his father and mother had spent their honeymoon. They even got the same room in the same hotel, right on the seafront. But there wasn’t much joy now. Thomas felt too old to holiday with his parents. His brother and sister were elsewhere. His parents seemed deflated, directionless, particularly his mother. They were going through the motions. They were trying to revive something. Father gritted his teeth. He suggested that he and Thomas rise<span data-page="page_final"></span> early and take a swim before breakfast. It would be bracing. Thomas would have preferred to sleep late but didn’t want to disappoint.</p><p>So they got up at seven, put on their swimming trunks, crossed the road to the sea, laid their towels on the pebbles, and waded in. The days it rained, they put the towels in plastic bags. The sea was gray. Thomas could still see his father’s body, birdlike but paunchy. His skin was dead white, his old red trunks baggy and slack. When the waves came up to his thighs, he would stop for a while, moving his hands back and forth in the cold water, crouching a little after a wave passed to keep his wrists covered, standing on tiptoe when the next wave rose to keep it off his crotch. “Wonderful air,” he shouted to Thomas. “So fresh.” He made a theatre of puffing out his chest and breathing deeply, and when finally he ducked his head into the water he would come up sputtering and protesting and flapping his arms. It was the theatre of someone trying to turn grayness into fun, trying to find a reason to rejoice. Thomas was aware now that he hadn’t been much help to his father. He’d launched into the first big wave and swum steadily out to sea. When he’d stopped and turned, treading water, the Reverend Sanders had been a small bald figure in a vast expanse of gray.</p><p>The years after that yielded nothing. Father started using aftershave and wearing colored shirts, even silk cravats. He looked quite the dandy. For Christmas, one gave him bath salts or body lotion. After lunch, he snoozed in an armchair, his trousers loosened. At dinner, he was as impatient as ever. He scraped the custard off his plate and hurried off to his sermons. That was the one time when he really came alive: preaching, persuading, seducing even, in his robes, from the pulpit. To Thomas’s brother, years on, Father had apologized. So his brother said. An awkward, hurried apology about the “too much religion we drummed into you.” And once, when Thomas came home late and was in the kitchen drinking coffee, his father had come down to pick at beef bones in the fridge and, with his mouth full, muttered, “I suppose it has been all right, in the end, this monogamous life.” Had that been an invitation to talk?</p><p>Thomas drank another beer and emptied a pack of nuts into a dish. He closed the document on his computer screen. What sort of life could his father have lived if he had openly declared that he no longer believed, no longer wanted to preach, no longer wanted his marriage? It was unthinkable. Mother would have been destroyed. His sister, and perhaps his brother, too, in a way. Thomas went back in his mind to those morning swims at Deal. Now that he thought about it, there had been a kind of melancholy father-and-son intimacy about them. He remembered the pebbles dark with dew, their slippery hardness when he took his plastic sandals off a couple of yards from the water. Dad put his glasses in his sandals, so as to be sure where they were. “What can you see without them?” Thomas asked. “The sea,” Father said, laughing. “The sky.” After a warm bed, the water was icy about your ankles. The breeze was chill. The pebbles were painful underfoot. Father began his spluttering routine, then his slow, blind breaststroke. Thomas put his head down and dived. He swam strongly out toward the dark horizon. Stroke after stroke. A powerful freestyle. He was showing off, of course, declaring the vigor and victory of youth. At the same time, it had been a pleasure to have his father there, in the water behind him, between him and the shore. He had felt protected somehow. He remembered that.</p><p>Now Thomas has swum out too far, and he stops and turns. He treads water, looking back at England’s coast, the long sweep of quaint, decaying façades, the pale clouds. The sea is all around, a slow gray swell. Dimly, he hears his father’s voice. “Tommy! Tommy!” Where is he? There. A wave rises and his father’s head with it. A small white dot. I can see him, Thomas thinks, but with his poor eyesight he can’t see me. “Tommy! Hey, Tommeee!” He’s worried for me, Thomas realizes. He’s worried that I’ve gone too far and may never make it back. ♦</p>	Tim Parks	December 8, 2014 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/12/08/reverend	Aging	Children	Church	Death	England	Fathers and Sons	Thomas	Third	Death
Save a Horse Ride a Cowgirl	<p>Heidi <span data-page="page_1"></span>and Bree were rear-ended on Route 1 by Sterne Clough, driving his brother’s Ford pickup. Neither girl seemed hurt. Sterne, though, felt the oddest sensation. It was as if someone had clamped an ice bag under his right armpit. It felt frozen and burned at the same time. Your body pulled all sorts of tricks on you when you turned sixty, and now he was seventy-four, so those tricks were less like pranks and more like extended jokes. He groped under his arm with his good hand, but felt only sweat. Nothing accounted for the pain, which was worse in his knee. Damn! His bad knee had banged the dashboard when the little car in front had accelerated and then stopped with no warning, just as the light turned green.</p><p>He got out of the truck, his knee none too helpful. It was distracting to have to stand there scowling at the damage while his armpit felt like a smoldering coal. Maybe later he could run a bamboo stick through a piece of steak and cook it in there. Meanwhile, he had some awareness that the car’s driver was still sitting in her seat, not even looking over her shoulder. The other girl stood by the mashed-in bumper of the car—at least the thing had a bumper—her hands on her hips.</p><p>“Are you too senile to be driving?” Bree asked Sterne.</p><p>“Want to tell me why your friend started off then stopped dead?” he asked.</p><p><em><strong>Audio:</strong></em> Ann Beattie reads.</p><p>“Because a squirrel ran across the road,” Bree said. And because she’s a total asshole, she thought, but she wasn’t about to tell the guy that. They’d been headed to the outlets in Kittery to stock up on jeans, and maybe see if the Puma store had got in the shoes she’d seen in an ad earlier that summer. They both went to U.N.H., where the fall semester was about to start. Now this. Compounded by the fact that Heidi was currently outside the car, retching. Everything put Heidi in a tailspin, which was her way of insuring that she wouldn’t have to take the blame for whatever had gone wrong: another girl threatening to attack Heidi for having stolen her boyfriend; the produce manager at the market irately insisting that she help him pick up the bin of mushrooms she’d sideswiped with her elbow. Now here came the cops, sirens blaring. A total shit situation.</p><p>Sterne’s younger brother, Bradley, was a lawyer. Within a few hours, he was able to find out that, at the moment the squirrel dashed in front of the car, the driver was texting. That, and the year before she’d been on academic probation for physically fighting with another girl. Plus, she had an unpaid speeding ticket and had been cited in June for throwing a Coke can out of a car window. It had been observed at the scene that she was driving barefoot. “Turn that off,” the cop had said of the music on the car radio, as Bree, not Heidi, complied with his request to see the car’s registration, since Heidi kept gagging, as if she were finishing her last round of chemo.</p><p>Of course Bradley was upset that his brother had been involved in an accident, but a little damage to his old truck didn’t bother him much. And a couple of phone calls had already guaranteed that Sterne was going to be fine. At worst, the insurance rates would go up. But it was 6 <em class="small">p.m</em>. and Sterne was still fixated on the accident, cursing both girls as he helped carry the bookcase he’d been transporting into Bradley’s new house.</p><p>Two years earlier, Bradley’s wife, Donna, had been given the wrong medication at a hospital in Boston and had died as a result. He’d wanted to stay in their house, but the cliché was true. There were too many memories. With the settlement check, he’d bought a smaller place, across the river from their old house, in a location that Donna would have loved. He’d got rid of a lot of their books—her cookbooks, along with her collection of poetry books, which he’d donated to Smith—but he still had a few left, and the new house had no built-in bookcases or built-in anything, so he’d kept an eye out for useful shelving at Leeward Landing Thrift Store, where lovely furniture appeared at the end of each summer.</p><p>Sterne had borrowed the truck because he needed to buy several large bags of mulch, and had volunteered to pick up the shelf on the way. Almost every weekend, for one reason or another, Sterne borrowed the truck. He always brought it back with a full tank of gas, even if there’d been only a quarter tank to begin with.</p><p>In the house the bookcase looked smaller than Bradley had expected. They’d positioned it between the living-room windows that looked out toward the river, but now he thought that it might be better in the dining room, which had a lower ceiling and not much furniture. Decorating was not his strong suit. What he wanted, basically, was to get the remaining books shelved. Sterne had finally quieted down about the day’s events and was assessing the bookcase with his hands clamped under his armpits.</p><p>“It doesn’t look right there,” he said.</p><p>“Maybe when it has books in<span data-page="page_2"></span> it,” Bradley replied vaguely.</p><p>“Where are they?”</p><p>“Upstairs. The movers carried all the boxes up to the second floor by mistake.”</p><p>“Why didn’t you make them carry them down?”</p><p>“I wasn’t here. I had a trial. Margie Randolph’s niece came over to supervise. She needed the money, because her babysitting job disappeared.”</p><p>The Randolphs, Bill and Margie, had been Bradley and Donna’s neighbors on Seagull Way. Bradley and Donna had had the corner lot, which gave them the advantage of great air circulation as well as a peek at the harbor. Their next-door neighbor, Miller Ryall, had spoken to no one, and no one had spoken to him, though his house sat between the Cloughs’ and the Randolphs’. It was said that after losing his job on Wall Street, Ryall had sold his New York condo and moved his family into their summer house, though the wife, Constance, had quickly decamped with their two-year-old son and the Haitian nanny, and Miller had now lived in the house alone for years. He kept the blinds closed, though sometimes in the evening he walked barefoot onto the front porch and sat in the porch swing, bare-chested and wearing his bathing trunks (although the pool no longer contained water), revealing the same perfectly sculpted body that the wives had all noted when the Ryalls first moved in.</p><p>Through Donna’s binoculars, which she had used to watch birds, Bradley could clearly see their old house. Maybe it was a little maudlin, but he liked watching his old home disappear into the darkness every night, and he liked equally well the interior lights on either side of the second story that came on at dusk and remained lit until 10 <em class="small">p</em>.<em class="small">m</em>. He was asking a lot for the house and was not inclined to come down on the price.</p><p>“What say we check out that new oyster place in Portsmouth?” Sterne said. “I hear they’ve got twenty local brews on tap, and I owe you, after crashing your truck into bimbos. It’s on me, bro.”</p><p>Odd that Sterne had become obsessed with beer in his old age. The same substance he’d disdained in college—all three colleges he’d attended, starting with Michigan and ending with Bates, and not even a degree to show for any of it after seven chaotic years. Neither alcohol nor food held much attraction for Bradley after Donna’s death. He just ate to keep going. But it was a nice offer—an apology and an attempt to cheer him up, no doubt—so he said jokingly that, if Sterne would drive, he’d enjoy such an outing very much.</p><p>“You don’t enjoy anything very much, but a few oysters and a brewski might help you get back on your feet,” Sterne said.</p><p>“Back on my feet? Do you remember that I won a trial last week that was a grand slam? I can pick and choose any case that interests me.”</p><p>“You want to avoid the subject. That’s fine. Not my place to nose in. I’m only thinking of you. Nobody knows what to do for you, me included.”</p><p>“Nobody has to do anything. Life goes on.”</p><p>“I don’t think you think it does,” Sterne said, “but I’ll keep my big yap shut.”</p><p>Portsmouth was sort of a nightmare, though they found a parking place in a bank parking lot where somebody had taken down the chain. Bradley felt sure they wouldn’t be towed. They started off toward the center of town, a boy on a skateboard clattering the wrong way down a one-way street as a couple of girls watched. What tattoos they had. What crazy earrings, feathery hippie things that hung to their jawbones. One had on a necklace of black skulls. The other wore flip-flops on her enormous, hennaed feet. “Make way for two old men,” Bradley said, using his arm, Darth Vader style, to cut through a cluster of boys who were smoking and holding their iPhones to the sky, jostling one another, checking out the girls. Sterne remarked on how much Portsmouth had changed. Bradley had to agree with him. In Prescott Park, a wedding was concluding, two little girls in lavender skirts so long the material almost tripped them as they threw flower petals everywhere they shouldn’t.</p><p>At the restaurant, the brothers were told that there was only a half-hour wait if they were willing to sit at the bar. Sure. What was half an hour? They sat on a stone wall with the buzzer the hostess had given Sterne. Bill Randolph and his daughter from his first marriage wandered over to greet them. A nice girl. Peggy? Patty. She lived somewhere far away, like Newfoundland. Somewhere Bill had to take a ferry to get to. Margie was attending a therapy session. She’d insisted that they go out and enjoy the lovely summer evening; she’d even thought to make a reservation for them at Mombo.</p><p>When Bill and his daughter first approached, Sterne had hopped down off the wall to greet them, as if <em>he</em> were the former neighbor. Bradley had got down, too—rude to sit there like Humpty Dumpty—but although he was glad to see Bill, he didn’t really know what to say. Bradley didn’t think this daughter had ever married, and he wondered if she might be gay. Her hair was cut like a man’s, though many women her age wore their hair that<span data-page="page_3"></span> way. He’d need another clue. Which would be what? A T-shirt emblazoned with the rainbow flag? Yes, he did think she was gay, standing there smiling a big, un-lipsticked smile, her feet, in Tevas, planted far apart. Donna would have figured it out in a flash, but there was no Donna, no flash.</p><p>Bill said that he missed having Bradley close by. Not that he’d moved far, but still, with him gone, there was only crazy Miller Ryall and all the noise he was causing.</p><p>“What’s that? Noise from what?” Bradley asked. It was some sort of adult jungle gym that he was constructing, Bill said. The swimming pool was still intact, but it had a different lining. Bill could see only a sliver of it from his attic window, peering through Tarzan’s jungle. (Ryall had wisteria growing on arbors all over the property, plus trumpet vines and roses that made his front door all but invisible.)</p><p>Eventually, they took their leave, Patty clomping, Bill quite demure beside his big-boned, fortyish daughter. Sterne picked up the suddenly madly flashing, vibrating black box and held it as if it might explode. Bradley found himself hoping that there wouldn’t be loud music they’d have to try to talk over, though sitting at the bar was good, in that situation. They’d be close together. Donna . . . she could hear a whisper across a room. No, of course she couldn’t if someone was blaring music, but in the silence of the house she could hear—really—she did once hear the sound he made while using a toothpick on his back teeth behind the closed bathroom door.</p><p>Oysters, yes. Fried calamari. An order of steamers. They ate so much they decided to share a main course. Sterne ordered a hard cider. Bradley agreed to another T. &amp; T., even though the tonic had been borderline flat. It was a fine idea, coming to the new restaurant. The noise level was atrocious, but after a while you got used to it. He felt proud of himself for knowing that it was Macy Gray on the sound system. Interesting to observe this summer’s fashions: clothes splashed with orange; cashmere scarves carried so that you could bundle up in the A.C. Bradley knew the difference between cashmere and other wools. On their long-ago trip to India, Donna had bought the loveliest cashmere shawl. His secretary had taken Donna’s clothes away, promising she’d donate them. Somewhere tonight, someone else could be wearing one of Donna’s dresses. How bizarre would that be, to see another woman in Donna’s clothes.</p><p>They decided on grilled swordfish with a mango compote (“compote” basically meant a little cup containing not enough of a substance), French fries, and lemon-peel arugula “slaw.” Why the menu put the last word in quotation marks was open to interpretation. When they’d finished eating, Sterne grabbed for the bill. Bradley had wondered if his brother really would pay for dinner, or if he’d expect Bradley to insist on picking up half the check. [cartoon id="a19645"]</p><p>Bradley dropped Sterne off at home and took his leave. At his own front door, he turned on the hall light, then turned it off again and stared into the house, wishing that he could feel the new configuration of hallways and stairs and rooms. In the old house, he could have maneuvered well even if he’d lost his sight—it was all so familiar. He turned the light back on and went into the living room and sat facing the windows, though he could see nothing through them. Well, now he could have things his way: no blinds, no curtains. He sat there trying to make up a little jingle, but nothing seemed to rhyme with “curtains.” Exertions, maybe? Lately, everything seemed to require twice the energy it had when Donna was alive. He closed his eyes but didn’t sleep. That would have been depressing: falling asleep after a big dinner, sitting alone in his living room. He sprang up, switching on the table lamp, but didn’t know what to do next.</p><p>He decided to get the iPad and look up the pictures he’d taken the week before, when, with almost no warning, the temperature had dropped and hail had begun to come down—hail the size of mothballs—a totally bizarre August hailstorm in southern Maine. When it finally stopped, he’d taken pictures of hailstones filling the birdbath and the recycling bin, like Styrofoam peanuts. It had done in his new hostas. According to a phone call from Margie, Miller Ryall had come out on his front lawn during the storm, wearing Jockey shorts, not even bathing trunks, raised his hands to heaven, and laughed and danced like some deranged freak on “Twin Peaks,” whooping and pirouetting. She’d taken a picture of that, through her front window. Bill was already joking about using it for their annual Christmas card. Now Miller Ryall was building . . . what was it? Something with high crossbars and netting slung beneath, a weird exercise system where the pool used to be. It sounded like a contraption Bradley might have seen in Vietnam, either for the troops to exercise with or, more likely, to torture prisoners.</p><p>He replaced the iPad on top of the bookcase and popped open a can of seltzer. He should review the long message a client had sent him earlier in the day—he knew<span data-page="page_4"></span> he should—but the weekend was coming, and that would be soon enough. He sorted through some mail, threw out half of it unopened, took another sip of seltzer.</p><p>I am dull, he thought. He knew he was. But there was something to be said for not feeling conflicted or tortured, just empty. Done in. He picked up the binoculars and looked at his old house. It must now be past 10 <em class="small">p.m.</em>—yes, it was—because across the river his upstairs lights had gone dark. Aiming the binoculars downward, he saw two figures swaying. At first he thought he was seeing low-hanging tree branches. But, no, out in front of his old house two people were dancing down the middle of the street. Of course, this was impossible. The entire block was asleep. So what was he looking at? It was Ryall. The stars cast enough light that he now saw Ryall’s long, thin nose highlighted—but who was the woman? On the same day he’d found out about the adult jungle gym, he was now seeing the reclusive Miller Ryall dancing outdoors with some woman? He thought about calling Bill and Margie, but didn’t want to wake them. Also, he didn’t want to seem to be fixated on his former neighbor, because . . . well, because he disdained Ryall.</p><p>He finished his seltzer, peed, and undressed, draping his clothes on the bedpost. The next day was Saturday, so he’d wear them a second day. He’d go to the market and buy a few locally grown, healthy things. Take care of himself. You had to at least contribute to a depression’s lifting. You couldn’t just stare into the darkness with binoculars, looking at your old life, or at foolish people outside your old house, which you once occupied with your wife, your wife who was killed by an inept twenty-five-year-old nurse. What the hell was Ryall doing, though? The guy usually stayed hidden like a rabbit in its warren. And all that construction noise certainly wasn’t going to help sell his house. Not that Ryall ever thought of others.</p><p>Bradley turned back the covers and slid into bed. He’d be up in two or three hours to pee. That happened when you drank: you thought your bladder was empty, but it filled up as soon as you lay down. And he’d had seltzer on top of the drinks. And ice water at the bar. He was never going to sleep, he thought. It was his last formed thought of the night.</p><p>“In a million years, you are never going to believe what I have to tell you,” Margie said to him at the market the next day. He was standing there with kale sprouting upward from his bag like green fireworks. The tomatoes weren’t well enough cushioned at the bottom. They’d bruise. Perhaps the skin would break. He’d also bought a bunch of flowers, because some kid was trying to raise money to go on a trip with the high-school orchestra. They were things you’d find alongside any road: Japanese knotweed, Queen Anne’s lace, and some limp-stemmed vine with a few dark-purple flowers that would probably drop off immediately. He looked at Margie neutrally, though he was eager to hear what she had to say. He’d cultivated this blank expression for the courtroom, and over the years it had become incorporated into his response to almost everything.</p><p>“Ryall’s got a live-in girlfriend,” she said. “He met her through Match.com. She waved to me and walked right over and introduced herself. I was seeing my niece off, and suddenly she held up a hand and ran over, so of course I had to shake it. Her name is Bree. Daniel is her middle name. You’ll never believe this: she was named for some woman in an old movie starring Donald Sutherland.”</p><p>“ ‘Klute,’ ” he said.</p><p>“Cute? Well, I wouldn’t say so—but with him the presence of any woman is cause for wonder.”</p><p>“No, no. The movie ‘Klute.’ Jane Fonda played the woman. She was a prostitute, I think. Go on, Margie.”</p><p>“She told me she was working at a store in Portsmouth, so she got a discount on the clothes. She was wearing a very swirly skirt that looked expensive. She’d dropped out of school and was going to be living next door. She brought up Match.com. I almost asked her if she knew that he didn’t speak to any of us. But then I thought, No, she’ll find out soon enough. That is, unless he’s decided to be a human being. Isn’t that amazing?”</p><p>“I suppose it is. Do you think there’s any connection between the contraption he’s having built and his new girlfriend?”</p><p>“You were born to be in your chosen profession, Bradley. That’s an interesting question. You’re thinking she might be an acrobat or something? One of those high-wire performers?”</p><p>He splayed his hands to pantomime not knowing. (“Stop pretending I’m a jury. I’m your wife,” Donna would have said if he’d gestured that way in her presence.) He’d been tempted to tell Margie about what he’d seen the night before, but he couldn’t imagine what she’d think of him, just happening to have binoculars, just happening to see the first real sign of life at Miller Ryall’s in whatever it was, ten years. Also—and this was the real reason he decided not to say anything; he<span data-page="page_5"></span> was quite aware that Margie wasn’t likely to judge him—he’d awakened that morning with a very disconcerting thought. A really troubling thought that for a few seconds he’d felt entirely convinced of. Shaving, he’d continued to think, Maybe it was Donna. Maybe she came back, and I wasn’t there—there was only Ryall—so she had her elegant, life-affirming dance with him. Such a thought was odd, he knew, even as he thought it. Yet it lingered, and he’d already decided that he’d jump in the car if he saw dancing again.</p><p>Now, after time had elapsed and he’d had two mugs of coffee, it occurred to him that the idea had popped into his mind because of some of the stories he’d heard in Vietnam—bizarre things that the Vietnamese believed about ghosts who could be seen only for as long as you looked at them, who vanished if you so much as blinked. By implication, the Americans were not only killing but blinking people away. Blinking them back into invisibility. He’d heard this from a nine-year-old boy who’d befriended him. He wondered what had happened to that boy, with his bloody knee and broken thumb, splinted with a tree branch, while at the same time he knew. That whole village had disappeared, though not while he was there; its end was not something he’d had any part in.</p><p>He and Margie parted after a peck on the cheek, and he started down the well-trampled hill with his bag of vegetables he didn’t really know how to cook. He should have kept at least one of Donna’s cookbooks. He’d boil water and drop the stuff in. The corn would cook just fine, and if the kale wasn’t edible he’d know better next time. The Queen Anne’s lace was dropping tiny flecks of white, like dandruff, on his car seat.</p><p>He drove out of the lot, a stream of tourists’ cars facing him at the intersection by Stonewall Kitchen, where they came off the highway. Maybe he should invite a tourist over for dinner. He could be like the squeegee men in New York City, setting upon drivers stopped at lights, rubbing filthy water over their windshields and demanding tips. But he would ask them to dinner instead. After all, in a world where people met their life partners on something called Match.com, what would be the harm in accepting a mere dinner invitation? Free food! Kale boiled with corn. Sliced tomato sprinkled with garden basil. He also had a package of chicken sausages. Sure, come on, happy summer people, enter into life as it’s really lived in Maine! The idea was starting to amuse him even as it made him feel horrible, like a condescending, ill-tempered human being.</p><p>To his surprise, he found that he had driven not to his new house but to the old one. When he saw where he was, he couldn’t remember how he’d got there. On autopilot, that was how. Abashed, he pulled into his driveway, only to find himself fenced in: Emil Andressen, his real-estate agent, had pulled in behind him in a silver Lexus, transporting a couple of potential buyers. Bradley got out with a faint, false smile. Emil was not happy to see him. This was bad timing. He’d been warned: buyers wanted to see nothing personal inside a house, no framed pictures, no scraggly plants, no memorabilia—and certainly not the owner. They needed, according to Emil, to have no obstacles to imagining themselves there. Anything could throw them off and ruin their imaginative projection—even the wrong fabric on furniture.</p><p>So, then, why had Emil blocked him in? Why hadn’t the man at least parked at the curb, or where a curb would have been, had one existed? The second he realized he was angry, another thought occurred to him: Bree? The Match.com girlfriend was named Bree? How many Brees could there be? What would it mean if it was the same young woman whose car his brother had hit in the fender bender? Could it be that small a world?</p><p>“Awfully sorry,” he managed to say to Emil. “I was just going to take a look around, make sure everything was O.K.”</p><p>“Are you the owner?” the woman said, throwing open the car’s back door. “If you are, will you give us a special tour of your lovely home? It’s No. 1 on our list of places to see. We’re hoping it’ll be our forever dream house in vacationland!”</p><p>This squealing woman seemed disastrously stupid. The sort of woman he couldn’t abide. Donna had been able to talk to anyone, but he had no facility for casual chatter. A forever dream house in vacationland?</p><p>Emil’s body jerked, as if he’d been hit by a big wave he’d turned his back to. His scrawny arms were actually flailing.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Bradley said, addressing Emil rather than the woman. “Why don’t you back up, and I’ll go on my way, Emil?”</p><p>“Oh, no,” the woman insisted. “Don’t y’all think that is too silly, having everybody disappear, as if nobody owned the house, as if we couldn’t possibly learn anything from y’all?”</p><p>Her husband, texting, got out of the car. He looked at Emil. “This is the house’s owner, who lives across the river now,” Emil said. “As he says, he was stopping by to check on things, but we should probably—”</p><p>“You should, but you’ve<span data-page="page_6"></span> got me blocked in, Emil,” Bradley said, more testily than he’d intended.</p><p>Emil was a former Tae Kwon Do instructor turned nurse’s aide, as well as a part-time real-estate agent, supporting his girlfriend and her ten-year-old son. He was also a four-years-and-counting member of Alcoholics Anonymous. A friend of Bradley’s—a twenty-year A.A. member—had recommended him when Bradley decided to sell the house. Why he hadn’t listed it with Sotheby’s he couldn’t imagine, but he had only himself to blame.</p><p>“And what all is that?” the woman said, twirling to look at the couple dancing in formal attire up the road. It was not yet 10 <em class="small">a.m.</em> God, they’d danced out from under the massive bowers of wisteria without a sideways glance and were doing a salsa, or something hippy and swivelling, up the middle of the road.</p><p>“Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers,” the woman said, grabbing her husband’s arm. “We are gonna have to refresh our ballroom-dancing skills to live in y’all’s neighborhood!”</p><p>“What’s that about, do you know?” Emil said to Bradley, rather urgently. “A prank? They’re playing a joke?” [cartoon id="a19615"]</p><p>The young woman dancing with Ryall had long dyed-blond hair and bony knees and wore black high heels with straps—official dancing shoes—and if everyone standing in the driveway was lucky she and Ryall would do their pas de deux around the block, and the couple would, indeed, assume that they’d been the victims of a practical joke. The dancing woman was so obviously not Donna—just some foolish girl, probably either drunk or stoned, enjoying her sudden romance with a guy who, out of a job or not, had big bucks and was putting her on big time by pretending to be up for anything, full of exuberance.</p><p>“Oh, I like this neighborhood already!” the woman buyer said, rising up and down on her toes.</p><p>Emil was backing up his car. For a quick second, Bradley caught his eye, and that glance said it all. It said, I am my family’s only source of income. It said, Get out of here now. It said, I will lose this sale. It said, Jack Daniel’s with two cubes and a cherry. Then it said, No, no, no.</p><p>“I have just got the best feelin’!” the woman said as Emil steered her toward the house. “Can’t we even ask him if he was really happy here?” Bradley heard her say as the front door closed.</p><p>Had he been really happy there? Of course. Or, rather, his wife had allowed him not to think about such a question at all. They’d carved out days and never realized that they were limited in number. “Carved” days. Why had he used that word? He didn’t know. He could “get in touch with his feelings,” an expression he detested, if he had to. But to whom would he reveal them? Not Sterne, who was afraid of his own shadow. Had Donna not died, he wasn’t sure they’d be close at all. There had been years in which they’d seen little of each other. His brother had also been in Vietnam, though his collapsed lung had got him sent home early. Sterne had been present for their mother’s death, just as Bradley had been there for their father’s.</p><p>As he pulled out of the driveway, he reversed so abruptly that the bag of vegetables toppled off the passenger seat and spilled onto the floor. He’d automatically reached out, as he had so many times to brace Donna when she’d sat there, but it wasn’t her; it was only a bag of kale, tomatoes, and corn, all of it bought for less than ten dollars. At the stop sign around the corner, he leaned over and picked up most of the things, which seemed more ordinary and less fascinating now than they had at the market. The truck in front of him inched and braked, inched and braked, waiting for an opening in the traffic. A sticker on its back window said, in big red letters, “<em class="small">SAVE A HORSE RIDE A COWGIRL</em>.” What was it with America and saving things? Yes, of course he got the slightly dirty joke. But, really, Americans felt they had to save everything from tadpoles to foreign countries. The argument was always that it was in their interest to do so; no one was naïve, no one a romantic. He supposed he should be thinking in terms of “we” rather than “they.” He was, after all, an American, too.</p><p>A little girl peeked out the back window of the truck and waved just as the truck lurched forward, taking off with squealing tires and a backward spray of gravel. No crash followed. Now Bradley watched for an opportunity to accelerate, but no one was giving an inch. A steady string of cars stretched in both directions, drivers feigning obliviousness of anyone trying to enter the stream. He wondered if he would ever be able to make the turn, if any car would flash its headlights, or simply stop. Was there even one civilized person left on the planet? He felt he might sit there until he turned to stone or drew his last breath. Until he died of old age—which was, of course, better than dying of someone’s ineptitude. These were the things that went through his mind as he sensed something bearing down on him from behind. His eyes<span data-page="page_7"></span> flicked up to the rearview mirror. With that slight motion, he became conscious of a headache forming. Of course the idiots were continuing their dance, emerging from some clever shortcut, since he hadn’t seen them turn onto the road leading to the stop sign.</p><p>Time passed. A convertible hesitated, but sped up when he removed his foot from the brake. Stone, he thought. Death. He and his car would be covered by the dust of time, just as his new hostas had been buried under the avalanche of hail. Eyes up! The couple was gaining on him, though he couldn’t imagine—and hoped he wouldn’t have to find out—whether they’d acknowledge his presence or merely dance around him. Were they completely in their own world? How much of it was a taunt? That had always been one of the crucial questions you needed to consider before you made a move in country: was something really happening, or was it a mirage, a hallucination?</p><p>The dancers came close, her smile lipsticked red. His crazy neighbor’s eyes blazed. They’d dance around him. He was invisible, the car a mere shell. His sense that he was idling at a stop sign in his old neighborhood in Maine, where some middle-aged Southern belle was inspecting his house and oohing over Donna’s Persian carpets, was just an illusion. He would exist only as long as the dancers didn’t blink, and so far, wild-eyed and dishevelled, they seemed not to.</p><p>They were almost upon him when he finally had a chance to shoot into traffic. Eventually, the road would take him to his new house, just as years before a plane had lifted him out of Saigon: <em>Plunk</em>. There you go. Sweet dreams. Or, better yet, none at all.</p><p>How long could people dance that way? How far could you get, pushing yourself beyond exhaustion? He knew the answer. He’d learned it. He’d learned, also, that whenever you thought you were having your moment, life tapped you on the shoulder and cut in. That was the cruel blink of fate’s eye. You were all wrapped up in each other, dancing? Oh, no, you don’t get to do that.</p><p><em class="small">SAVE A HORSE RIDE A COWGIRL</em> had pulled into the local ice-cream stand. He gave a two-fingered salute as he passed, in case the little girl was watching. It would have been nice to see her fine blond hair again. Her little fingers. But things didn’t work like that. He was inside an anonymous car. He’d been only a moment’s diversion for her. Still, he wiggled his fingers in imitation of the way she’d moved hers, remembering as he did the horrible Chinese bird spiders, bigger than her palm, the poisonous spiders for whose bite there was no antivenom—one of which had once so startled Callahan by springing out of his empty boot that he’d screamed and raced into Bradley’s arms.</p><p>Another time. Another country. The stakes were so different now, though the old life-or-death thing still took its toll.</p><p>What would he dream, if he could determine his dreams? Years ago, he’d seen a man named Dr. McCall, who had asked him just that. The man had written with a pencil with a sharp point. He wrote only when something impressed him. It didn’t seem very professional, in retrospect, that he had let his patient see how infrequently his pencil moved. “Oh, a nice trout stream with burbling water and leaping fish, and wading boots in the right size, for once, and clouds to block the sun but not the light,” he’d said. No movement of the pencil. “Or the opposite: working in a skyscraper in New York City, beautiful women throwing themselves at me, the whole male-fantasy thing.” Nothing. McCall had said, “You’re just going with the usual all-American fantasy? You don’t wish to banish any memory of the dead?” McCall sat behind his desk in a wheelchair. He was said to be the best shrink at Walter Reed. He’d once been a patient there himself, and he had a low tolerance for fairy tales.</p><p>“Any answer?” the doctor had persisted.</p><p>McCall must not have been married. In those days, shrinks were cagey: if it worked to wear a wedding ring, they wore it; if it didn’t help, they left it on the dresser. Still, there was often the tell-tale white circle. What he wouldn’t give for one more chance to look at the doctor’s hand. But McCall had disappeared from the V.A. Maybe the guy had found his own trout stream. Maybe he was happily married to some woman who sewed his buttons back on and gave him a push uphill when he needed it. Back then, Bradley had been just one of thousands of Humpty Dumptys who needed to be put back together.</p><p>Now he wore Donna’s gold wedding band on the chain from which he’d removed his dog tags. It dangled so low that no one could mistake it for a necklace. Not that he ever showed it to anyone. No one could have known that the way the ring warmed up or cooled reminded him constantly of her. She’d been killed, as so many had, by friendly fire. That girl—the so-called nurse—was on Facebook. She was married, with a son and a daughter. He wished her nothing good: no dream answered, no summer vacation. A terrible illness, of the kind that so<span data-page="page_final"></span> often ironically befell those in her profession, could not make her sick enough to satisfy him. His thoughts were nothing but uncharitable. And if her children grew up to fight in their own war? Well, it would certainly be sad if they never came home.</p><p>In his living room, he raised the binoculars and looked across the river. No sign of the dancers. Maybe—because his own life seemed to move so excruciatingly slowly—Miller Ryall and the girl were living in sped-up time. They had already married, had children, sent them off to college, attended their weddings, and were waiting excitedly for grandchildren, who’d come to play on the wooden contraption that could dangle them upside down for hours, or break their ribs if they sprang free.</p><p>The house sold for almost eighty thousand dollars more than the asking price. Bradley and Emil drank a Newman’s Own lemonade at the ice-cream place to celebrate, sitting under a big umbrella. Emil was riding high, astonished at his good luck. “I don’t know, man,” he said, shaking his head. “I mean, it’s funny now, but the two of us standing there, watching that weird mating ritual going on down the middle of the street? It’s something I’ll tell the grandkids, and we haven’t even got around to having our own kids yet.”</p><p>“Don’t do it. Enjoy your lives with each other,” Bradley said.</p><p>“Beg pardon?” Emil said.</p><p>He didn’t repeat himself. Anyone who didn’t want to hear didn’t have to. His own brother never asked him any personal questions. Not about what had happened in the war, not about why he and Donna had never had kids (how would he dare ask that, since he’d never married?), not about his sessions with Dr. McCall. It was really cowardice that Sterne asked nothing. It almost made Bradley want to call his brother and force him to talk about those things, but his hostility was misplaced. His brother was a fuckup, and had been all his life. It had protected him from many things, so who was Bradley to say that it wasn’t an effective defense strategy? Sterne couldn’t speak Donna’s name, but he forgave him for that.</p><p>Donna had never taken pleasure in anyone else’s pain, but she might have been intrigued by the mental breakdown that resulted in their old neighbor’s being carted off to the hospital. Emil had been there, working the night shift as a nurse’s aide, when Miller Ryall was admitted, and he gave Bradley the details the next day. Bree had disappeared as quickly as she’d come.</p><p>“Why would we live on a street called Seagull Way?” Donna had asked him when they were young and they’d first made an offer on the house. She would have been surprised by the last-minute bidding war that drove up the price, and surprised as well that when Ryall’s house was listed Bill and Margie moved instantly to buy it, later constructing an enclosed passageway that led from one house to the other. Bill’s sister lived there for a while, following her stroke. But Donna would have thought Bradley silly for giving Sterne her expensive binoculars. He’d decided that he wanted to know less, not more, about his former life. He gave his brother the truck, too; he really didn’t need it anymore. When he stopped returning Margie’s calls, she stopped calling and only nodded if they crossed paths. What had he said to Donna when she’d asked that question about living on Seagull Way? He forgot so much. Not his feelings toward her, just what, exactly, they’d said. Maybe he’d answered, “Because that’s what this pretty street happens to be called.” Once it had seemed an unusually pretty street, safe, predictably quiet, a street where—even if some pride was involved in assuming such a thing—everyone else seemed worse off than they were. She had no doubt nodded in agreement. ♦</p>	Ann Beattie	November 23, 2015 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/23/save-a-horse-ride-a-cowgirl	Books	Car Accidents	Couples	Death	Families	Grief	Bradley	Third	Death
Stuff	<p>It was December, and he was in the windowless consultation room of his doctor’s office. A young man with a stunningly high forehead was informing him that he had lung cancer and would die—the certainty of this being considerable—soon.</p><p>The doctor was not familiar to Henry. The one he usually saw was at a baptism or a wedding that afternoon, Henry wasn’t sure which, the information having been relayed to him by a receptionist hastily swallowing her lunch.</p><p>He asked the young man with the intimidating forehead if he would kindly repeat what he had just said. The words were repeated, and Henry’s first thought was that his own doctor had been too embarrassed to tell him. His second thought was that this was unlikely.</p><p>“I call them work sticks,” Henry said, somewhat defensively. “They’re why I’m able to write so much.”</p><p>“Really? What sort of thing do you write?”</p><p>“I wouldn’t have been able to concentrate without cigarettes.”</p><p>“There you go, then,” the doctor said.</p><p>“I write a column for the community paper, the <em>Zephyr</em>. Every week I write a column. I have for years.”</p><p>“I see,” the doctor said.</p><p>Henry wrote about the seasons—companionable winter, radiant spring, mellifluous summer, and the tinglingly vivid fall. He wrote about hydrangeas—though he was wearying of hydrangeas—and twice a year he was depended upon to write about the equinox (the moment when a precise division between day and night occurs should not pass unnoticed). He wrote about screened porches and baked-bean pots. He enjoyed a modest but loyal following as one of the town’s steadfast and honorable lights. Only Yolanda Piper—archon, intercessor, and indefatigable defender of the rights and needs of at-risk teens, particularly those suffering from anger issues—could be considered his peer. The citizenry depended on the two of them to do the heavy lifting of optimism and the good works necessary for the diffident functioning of the social contract.</p><p>“Funny name for a newspaper.”</p><p>“What,” Henry said. “Why?”</p><p>The doctor stared at him. “You made it to eighty-five—that should be a consolation.”</p><p>“No, no, I’m not eighty-five.”</p><p>“It says . . .” The doctor frowned. “This sheet’s been misfiled, sorry. Those girls at the desk, all they think about is getting laid.”</p><p>Bless them, Henry thought warmly.</p><p>The doctor turned to a computer and tapped savagely on the keyboard for a few moments. “You’re sixty-three,” he reported.</p><p>“That’s me!” Henry cried.</p><p>“You have lung cancer as well, a bit more advanced, actually.” The doctor stared at him again. “Sorry about the mixup.”</p><p>In the parking lot, Henry got into his car, put on his glasses, and harnessed himself into his seat.</p><p><em class="small">CLICK IT OR TICKET</em>!</p><p>He was the little boy who had once bought an instructional record: “How to Teach Your Canary to Sing.”</p><p>Now he was going to die.</p><p>Only last year, he had been on the cover of the telephone directory, looking kind, fit, and comfortable. This was an honor that continued to elude Yolanda and her group of thuggish youths. He had been supplanted this year by an artist’s rendering of a new wind farm. Green pastures, sleek white blades, blue sky—a pleasing evocation of the extraterrestrial and the ecologically sound. Except that little appeared freshly green or white or blue anymore. Everything looked increasingly worn and shorn, though no one was saying anything about it. That was why his columns were still being tolerated. He wasn’t bringing it to anyone’s attention, either.</p><p>He had researched the winds of the world for a column about the smoky sou’wester, and he liked to recount them silently when he felt a little low.</p><p>sirocco</p><p>cordonazo</p><p>harmattan</p><p>pampero</p><p>levanter</p><p>shamal</p><p>simoon</p><p>The parking attendant wanted twenty-one dollars. Henry had crossed the uncompromising boundary between the first and second hour while he was idling in the lot, thinking about his canary record. He hadn’t even had a canary. He had hoped to have a canary.</p><p>He had the shameful urge to inform the attendant that he had just been told he had lung cancer and was going to die. Perhaps the fee would be waived. But he suspected that the fee would not be waived. This sort of thing must happen all the time. If the recently condemned weren’t required to pay their fair share, the lot would bring in no money at all.</p><p>He wished it were May. He’d always enjoyed writing about May, with its confidence of daylight, the inviting lassitude of the sea. . . . But it was not May. It was twelve days before Christmas, and the daylight looked no more certain of what it was doing than he was.</p><p>Henry’s Christmas columns were never his best. Dancing lights . . . hope and praise . . . the human hunger for realization through the symbolism of outward signs . . . that sort of thing. He’d authored some terribly insipid ones in the past, though even worse were the inaccurate ones, like the piece about the song “Guardian Angels,” the one Mario Lanza had belted out so beautifully. Henry had always thought that the guardian angels <em>were</em> the bears, and not the beings who shooed <em>away</em> the bears. His credibility<span data-page="page_2"></span> had taken a hit on that one. This year, though, given his newly acquired station, he could write a piece about his last Christmas. It could be heartwarming, maybe even become a classic. He’d write a column about buying a last Christmas tree and then show it to his old mother in that frightful home she was in, and, in that way, inform her that he was about to die. He’d never been able to tell her anything straight out, and this was no exception. She might not be overly alarmed, being close to a hundred years of age herself and the one who was supposed to be dying, though she never did.</p><p>Between Henry and his home, a town house of no distinction, lay the only Christmas-tree lot accredited by the town, which was managed each year with sturdy efficacy by Yolanda Piper and her at-risk charges. Henry swept decisively into the lot, apparently without signalling, as his fellow-travellers fell in fury upon their horns.</p><p>Five surly youths wearing red raglan smocks and merry tasselled hats turned toward him in astonishment. He exited the car and smiled broadly, his teeth creaking. “Merry Christmas!” he screamed.</p><p>“I love Christmas,” a girl said to no one in particular. “Santy Claus and all that shit. But I’m not as happy as I think I should be. Can you help me?”</p><p>“I want the biggest and most beautiful tree you have,” Henry declared. “That one will do.” He gestured toward a spruce thrust haphazardly in a bucket, its core a mandala of yellowing needles.</p><p>Yolanda appeared, out of nowhere, it seemed.</p><p>“The great essayist,” she said in greeting. “How’s the bears?”</p><p>The tree had already been hauled from the bucket and thrown at the feet of a boy wearing tight pegged jeans and a T-shirt. Yolanda was always provided with a youth from juvenile detention to fresh-cut the stumps, which seemed to Henry quite redundant, as far as the tree was concerned. The miscreant’s duties also included trussing the tree in plastic webbing shot from a compressor for the journey toward its temporary final home.</p><p>“Yolanda,” Henry said earnestly. “Merry Christmas!”</p><p>A pine needle protruded from her mouth. “Let me ask you something, Mr. Essayist. Do you think the trees smell as good this year?”</p><p>“Oh, I do!”</p><p>“They don’t smell at all. Some beetle’s been after them in the field. You’re whiffing nostalgia, my friend.”</p><p>There were several lines of verse tattooed on the delinquent’s arm—though they weren’t called delinquents anymore, of course. Against his better judgment, Henry strained to read them. He shuffled closer.</p><p>And silence sounds no worse than cheers</p><p>After earth has stopped the ears.</p><p>Housman! On this blighted youth! He was so happy. . . .</p><p>“Back off, creep,” the boy said. “This is in honor of my friend, not for creeps.”</p><p>“He was an athlete! And he died young!” Henry was beside himself. Here was a connection across the cruel and indifferent ages.</p><p>“Make this prevert back off, Yo.”</p><p>“It’s ‘pervert,’ Lawrence. How many times do I have to correct?” She regarded Henry. “Henry,” she said.</p><p>“Yolanda!” He was still somewhat ecstatic.</p><p>“How do you want your life to be remembered, Henry?”</p><p>The youth resumed indelicately sawing away at the stump.</p><p>“Oh, I have no illusions that it will be remembered,” he said modestly. He looked down at his shoes. They were formal shoes with his own feet concealed inside. This puzzled him for a moment.</p><p>“Why were you set loose on this earth, Henry? Do you have any idea?”</p><p>The shoes were really something. Shiny.</p><p>“Get out of here,” Yolanda commanded. “Go home and write about your buttercups, you foolish old man.”</p><p>He had never written about buttercups. Never. He had warmed over the dead gods of the months and he had written about wasps a couple of times, wrung some wonder from contemplating their world of insectual intent—the papery nests, the cells of mathematical perfection, the nurses and the workers, the grubs that waited for transformation behind their silken doors, their black eyes perfectly visible. . . . One column had been particularly good, something about wasps in the fall, crawling into houses or garages to prolong their lives a little. “In such a last retreat . . .” Was that how he had put it? “But it is not meant that they should continue. . . . Their ingenuity is in vain.”</p><p>But that didn’t sound like him. Maybe it was someone else who had written about wasps.</p><p>He felt blue. He was dying, and the doctor, or whoever that had been, hadn’t even given him a prescription to fill. Still, he felt fortunate that he didn’t have that moribund bound tree in his trunk. The teens at risk hadn’t had an opportunity to stuff it in there while Yolanda was berating him. He drove reluctantly home. In the parking slot allotted to him in his town-house cluster, two men had set up a card table and were soliciting signatures for a proposal to give a tax credit to households with guns. They had occupied this slot before. They seemed comfortable with the assumption that it was the ideal space for their endeavor and had assured Henry that this was but the first step of the process. After they had won the tax credit, they would petition for<span data-page="page_3"></span> the elimination of taxes altogether, because of the infeasibility of collecting them now that everyone had guns.</p><p>They nodded manfully at Henry as he drove past. He had never admitted to them that paying taxes provided him a quiet pleasure. He turned back onto the highway, to the indignant screams of horns, and drove to Ambiance, the home where his mother resided. He would forgo waiting to tell her about his condition until he had written the Christmas column. He didn’t want to write that column. He thought the place was called Ambiance, but the name never stuck with him; it was the banner in the lobby that had made a persistent impression. “<em class="small">JUST TO BE HERE IS SO MUCH: RILKE.</em>” Rilke! The things corporations got away with . . .</p><p>His mother was a bit of a celebrity at Ambiance, because her previous home had been destroyed in a flood. She and the five other occupants of Wing Three in that place had been abandoned by the staff, and when rescuers arrived, a week later, with bleach and body bags, they weren’t at all prepared for what they found. There was no joy, just troubled amazement. The old people were alive! Dehydrated, of course.</p><p>The new home his mother had been placed in was a continuing-care facility similar to the one that had washed away, though this one was constructed on a soccer field that had been built over a tailings-filled wash, which had once been the principal drainage for a mountain that had been topped for a dozen astrophotometrical telescopes. Since the personal effects of all the patients from the old home—not just the six left to rot on Wing Three—had been lost, the Ambiance staff had placed in each new room framed photographs of attractive people enjoying lovely things. It was a generous <em>non sui generis</em> approach that had worked out well—there were zero complaints—particularly since these photographs were shifted about weekly to create diversity and a fresh dynamic in each tenant’s private environment. This had the added benefit, management maintained, of providing the professional caregivers with a little fun to keep their spirits up, for otherwise they’d be simpering, “Who’s the President? Who’s the President?” every other time they entered a room.</p><p>Henry climbed the great steps and entered the lobby. There was the banner, as commanding and insouciant as ever. He felt uncharacteristically bold enough to say to the receptionist, “How awful to use Rilke like this!”</p><p>“It’s the risk poets run in their endless attempts to transfigure reality. Reality circles around and bites them in the ass.”</p><p>The receptionist was a man of indeterminate age with a skin disorder. His face was raw; the skin seemed quietly percolating. He dug at his jaw and regarded Henry. Henry closed his eyes. It was only a matter of time before a hole would create itself from the weeping slough of the man’s face, presenting a glimpse of the preposterous fundamentals, rather like the truth window in a straw house.</p><p>“Do I have to sign in or anything?” Henry finally asked.</p><p>“Naw, naw, you know the drill.”</p><p>Henry fled, though he did not, having visited infrequently, to his intermittent shame, know the drill. After some difficulty, he managed to find his mother’s room. She was sitting upright, wearing an elaborate flamingo-pink bed jacket with large padded buttons. She looked at him sympathetically as he searched for a place to sit. The room was cluttered, with most of the space taken up by a dark credenza, upon which baskets and boxes and vases were stacked. He remembered the credenza. It had held table silver in his childhood, each place setting stored in its own pocket of cloth. In the curves of the massive thing, he had concealed his plastic soldiers. He’d had two favorites. One was poised to throw a grenade, the other had a flamethrower holstered on his bent back. Each had a bland face beneath a helmet. Henry extended a hand tentatively to see if they were still there, then drew it back. Better not to know.</p><p>The photograph on the bedside table was of two blond children throwing bread to a peacock. The peacock had turned from the mirror that kept it entertained in its pen toward the pieces of falling bread.</p><p>Henry pulled an animal’s travelling crate close to the bed and sat on it. There was a frayed leather identification tag on the grille of the crate. It had been chewed.</p><p>“We have to speak quietly,” his mother said. “Debbie’s on the other side of the curtain there. She’s into dystopian video games and she’s very, very good.”</p><p>“Thank you, hon,” came a frail voice.</p><p>“I didn’t know you had a roommate,” Henry said. “I thought we—you—were paying for a private room here.”</p><p>“I have friends, Henry. I suppose you don’t. That does not surprise me. When you were a boy, the other children would draw a circle around you in the playground and tell you you couldn’t break through it—and you couldn’t.”</p><p>“Perhaps that happened once, Mother.”</p><p>“Oh, it was more than once.”</p><p>The crate shifted beneath Henry and bumped the table, causing the picture to rock, though it did not fall. “Do you know who these people are?” he demanded, wanting to change the subject from that darn circle that had bedevilled him so.</p><p>“Of course<span data-page="page_4"></span> I don’t. Gertrude brought that in here, tried to make me think I had forgotten my own children. Gertrude’s been in the business for years and hasn’t suffered a single suicide. Won’t even permit us to stop eating. She says that no one must anticipate God’s absolving hand. We call her St. Gertrude.”</p><p>“So you don’t know who these children are,” Henry said stubbornly.</p><p>“You think you’re on your way to doing something and you’re just stopping by for a moment. Is that correct?”</p><p>“Yes, for a visit.” Maybe he wouldn’t tell her about his diagnosis after all. She didn’t seem to be in a receptive mood.</p><p>“We pity visitors. There are just us Gnostics here. And goth Deb. We maintain that the world is an illusion. The unconscious self is consubstantial with perfection, but because of a tragic fall it is thrown into a foreign domain that is completely alien to its true being. It’s always a fall, a tragic fall, and here we are. That’s it, in a nutshell.”</p><p>“Goodness, Mother, when did you come up with all this?” The last coherent conversation he’d had with her had concerned some urinary-tract infection.</p><p>“Yarn-painting class. And sometimes when we do that low-impact foot exercise thoughts come. Some consider Gnosticism flawed, an individualistic, nihilistic, escapist religion incapable of forming any kind of true moral community, but naturally we disagree with that assessment.”</p><p>Henry could not conceal his alarm.</p><p>“Oh, don’t look so frightened. You were always such a frightened little boy. I stuck too closely to the recommended guidelines when I was raising you.”</p><p>“You’ve never talked this way before, Mother.” He felt the crate buckle a bit beneath his weight.</p><p>“Surely you realize that what we’re saying here is very different from what you visitors think you’re hearing, though I do wonder what’s getting through to you, Henry.”</p><p>He had been allowed to shine the silver with a round, almost weightless sponge that fit perfectly into the tin of polish.</p><p>He had been permitted to kiss his infant sister in her coffin. He had placed one of his soldiers beside her, couched in a pucker of silk. He had said that it was his favorite one, but it was not. It had never been his favorite one.</p><p>“I’m sure you were given the opportunity to learn a thing or two in this life, but the learning was so inappropriate to your situation that your not understanding was assured. Are you still writing those sappy articles, Henry? You sent them to me for the longest while. They were seldom subjects of discussion here. You wrote much that was regrettable.”</p><p>“I’m a nature writer,” he protested. “The world has changed. I only try to provide something formerly recognizable that people can take comfort in.”</p><p>His infant sister’s forehead had felt like a feather.</p><p>“Your father and I always found the world to be unfamiliar, but it was the custom then to behave otherwise. We made every effort to reassure you, and would have done the same with your sister, had she lived.”</p><p>The door opened and someone cried, “Who’s the President?” From behind the curtain came a weary giggle.</p><p>With the door once more shut, the room resumed its pestilential pallor. A large crazed platter was displayed on the credenza. It had been brought out only on special occasions, whereupon Henry’s mother would always say, “Darwin married a Wedgwood heiress, which was why he could afford to think whatever nutty thing he wanted.”</p><p>“There’s so much stuff in here,” Henry fretted. “It’s practically a fire hazard.”</p><p>“What ‘stuff,’ Henry? For a writer, you do choose words that lack evocative distinction.”</p><p>There was a harrow in the corner. A harrow! There couldn’t be a harrow. It was just something he remembered, rusting behind a barn, a barn around which an addled old dog of theirs had worn a worry trail.</p><p>“There is no stuff,” she continued. “The trees are no longer trees, nor are the children children. You’ll see.”</p><p>The credenza couldn’t be here, either, Henry decided. It had been destroyed in the flood. It was possible that it had been destroyed even before the flood, but it was not possible that it was here now. He felt better having arrived at this determination, though the credenza remained. Perhaps it thought it was a credence and not a credenza at all, one that had fallen, in the manner of an unlucky angel, to the blasphemous station of a mere sideboard. Whatever it was, it was allowing him no quarter.</p><p>“Why is your mouth open like that, Henry? Are you thinking?”</p><p>“Mother, I’m afraid I have some rather bad news. I’m going to die soon. According to the doctor, I’m dying. Just like you,” he added unnecessarily.</p><p>After a moment she said, “Oh, well.”</p><p>“Take that, you fucker,” Deb murmured behind the curtain. He wondered what the old woman looked like, though it was probably irrelevant.</p><p>“We were handed a very imperfect deal, Henry,” his mother said. She sipped from a tall fluted glass filled with a green liquid the inviting color of antifreeze.</p><p>“Goodness, Mother, is that a <em>stinger</em>?”</p><p>“Yes, it is. Why do you look so aggrieved? As a child, you so often wore an expression of aggrieved expectation. You always wanted what someone else had.”</p><p>“I certainly don’t want a stinger, Mother. I’m surprised they’re allowed in here is all.”<span data-page="page_final"></span></p><p>“Gnostics often use the terms ‘drink’ or ‘drunkenness’ to depict the pathetic fate of the entrapped spirit, but we don’t take that literally. In any case, an exception is made in regard to stingers. Manhattans as well.”</p><p>“Those things are crazy.”</p><p>“Language, language, Henry. It’s important to be precise.”</p><p>“I had a stinger once,” Henry said. “I got so sick.”</p><p>He suddenly felt that he could make anything appear in this room, anything he wanted. His father’s rack of pipes, the bird’s nest he had destroyed on a dare. Anything. His old dog, breathing heavily in dream. This was a magic place. He couldn’t do it with words. He had never been able to do it with words. He looked around greedily. The cupcake that homely little girl had made for him in fourth grade, for he was homely, too. The lake they’d lived beside once, its water on his skin. . . . It was just a matter of control, of acceptance, of linking the two. Not difficult. Why had he not come here more often? He smiled and, raising his hand as if for further permission, just as suddenly realized that he could not make anything appear in this room.</p><p>He had never seen that lurid bed jacket before. The buttons were as big as baseballs.</p><p>He wished his mother had made more of a fuss over what he’d told her, or any fuss at all.</p><p>“But, as a rule, we depreciate matter first and foremost,” his mother was saying. “Only the knowledge that results in self-transformation is necessary. Resurrection comes first. Death follows after. Unimportant. One who does not know himself knows nothing, Henry.”</p><p>“I don’t feel well, Mother.”</p><p>“It may be one of those rolling heart attacks. Won’t kill you but makes you queasy. But, on a lighter note, here’s my question: Do you think there’s a moral weight to our actions? We’re sort of divided in regard to that question here. There are those who think that the middling among us perish forever. Others feel that if we’ve performed our duties in a more or less decent fashion we will continue to muddle on in some manifestation on an altogether different plane. Still others argue that it’s perfectly acceptable to have confounded right and wrong throughout one’s life and that there’s not a sliver of difference between the two.”</p><p>“I haven’t an opinion,” he said moodily. How desolate it was in here. A fluorescent bulb warbled listlessly above them. A pair of muddy gardening gloves lay at the edge of the coverlet. “No, I do have an opinion! I think it’s folly to wonder about these matters here, now, at your age. <em>Folly</em>,” he emphasized. Was it the right word? It would have to do.</p><p>His mother’s face grew pale. She seemed about to cry.</p><p>“I suppose I’d select ‘muddle on in some manifestation,’ ” he allowed.</p><p>Regaining her composure, she once again regarded him with exasperation. The gardening gloves slipped off the coverlet and disappeared in the dark whorled pattern of the rug.</p><p>“I have a radical-silence group in twenty minutes,” she said, consulting a delicate watch on her bony, spotted wrist. “Goodbye, Henry.”</p><p>“But I just got here,” he muttered. Still, he clumsily vacated the animal crate, jostling the framed picture again. The representation didn’t seem to be the same. There were similarities, many similarities, but . . . What did he know of the peacock? It is thirsty, always thirsty, and its tail is not a tail but a feathered train, a magnificent and seemingly unnecessary train.</p><p>This didn’t seem much to know.</p><p>“Will you be able to find your way out?” his mother said.</p><p>He nodded, somewhat stung by her dismissal, and exited into the hallway, which was empty and cruelly illuminated. On a monitor, news of the weather scrolled by. The winds were moderate; they had no special names.</p><p>He felt oddly that he had been robbed and that the robber was within him now. Even so, he would have to find the lobby, avoiding the receptionist, if possible, then brave the outside, where there would be darkness and steps to navigate. ♦</p>	Joy Williams	July 25, 2016 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/25/stuff-by-joy-williams	Afterlife	Books	Cancer	Christmas trees	Columnists	Death	Henry	Third	Death
Sun City	<p>They <span data-page="page_1"></span>floated into the afternoon in their little stucco submarine, the blinds shut against the sunlight and the swamp cooler whistling on the roof. Bev sat on the couch, Rose knelt on the matted carpet, and in the artificial air the two women wrapped jewelry in tissue paper and placed it in egg cartons. Rose had had this idea, the egg cartons, on the plane to Arizona, and it had made her feel organized. In the aftermath of her grandmother’s death, at least there were omelettes to be made. When she realized just how much stuff her grandmother, Vera, had owned, and how little of it Bev wanted to keep, Rose should have come up with a new plan. Instead, they just kept eating eggs.</p><p>Cline, Bev’s guinea pig, wandered out from under the couch. “It’s Cline after Patsy Cline, you know,” Bev explained for the fifth time that week, as the album spun to silence on the stereo in the hallway. She heaved herself off the couch and over the child gate that kept Cline in the living room. Bev was majestically huge. The lift of her legs over the gate reminded Rose of dockyards, cranes, and I-beams, vast weight swinging dangerously free. If the house weren’t a concrete box laid flat on the dirt, the floors would shake. Rose, solid herself, envied this size; Bev looked armored, untouchable, as if nothing could come at her that wouldn’t bounce straight off. Vera’s death, the divesting of her possessions—at the end of the week, Bev would step over it all and disappear into some other hallway of her life.</p><p>“They eat these, you know,” Rose said, scooping Cline off the floor. “In South America.”</p><p>“That’s disgusting.” Bev swung herself back into the room, and Patsy Cline went walkin’ after midnight on the stereo.</p><p>Rose moved Cline’s front legs in a little dance. “It’s a delicacy. There’s a painting of the Last Supper in some church in Peru where Jesus eats guinea pig.”</p><p>Bev lifted Cline onto her shoulder. “No one’s going to eat you here, sweetie. We aren’t savages.”</p><p>“They roast them whole, eyes and toenails and everything.”</p><p>“Why are you telling me this?” Bev cuddled Cline defensively.</p><p>It was a real question, and Rose felt sheepish. “Sorry,” she said, and held up a pair of clip-on silver bird earrings, still on the plastic backing from the store. “Are you sure you don’t want these?”</p><p>“I don’t need Vera’s old costume crap. I’ve got enough junk of my own.”</p><p>Rose agreed with her there. The house bulged with it: cowboy figurines and Kokopellis and monotonous Southwestern art, cheerful brown children in brown pueblos. Bev’s own cheerful white grandchildren smiled from every wall, in frames shaped like hearts or guitars or kitten heads, the pictures cut off at awkward angles inside. “This pair’s real silver,” Rose offered.</p><p>“Take ’em for yourself. Take anything you like. We’ve been through this.”</p><p>“I wear pierced, not clip.”</p><p>“I noticed. Five times in the one ear, four in the other.” Bev peered more closely at the pair of birds. “She never wore those. Your mother sent them to her one Christmas. She hated them.”</p><p>“O.K., then. To the consignment store.” Rose tried to tuck them into an egg cup, but the plastic backing didn’t fit. The birds eyed her, wedged on top of the coiled necklaces.</p><p>Bev wore almost no jewelry, just a tiny gold cross with a diamond in the center. The back of the chain disappeared between two rolls of her neck and emerged on either side to end in a dainty point of light. It blinked at Rose from Bev’s oceanic chest.</p><p>Vera had lived in this house for eight years, a long quiet twilight filled with card games at the neighborhood clubhouse, a bowling league, classic-movie channels. Vera and Bev were both retired and hadn’t seemed to miss their jobs. They’d both been widowed, and made it known that they didn’t miss their husbands. Vera had been a secretary for a company that made plastic garbage cans. Bev had been an electrician. She kept her hair short and played softball and, in the photos Vera sent, wore overalls, until her weight ballooned and she switched to housedresses. They co-wrote their Christmas letters, trading off every paragraph to crack jokes about each other. They included pictures of themselves at the botanical garden, or at a Diamondbacks game, their full names—Vera Beasley and Beverly Morrison—written on the back. They filled the frame, these two old ladies, one large and one lean, smiling and pressing their cheeks close.</p><p>“Say hi to Bev,” Rose wrote in every note to her grandmother—postcards or thank-you notes for the five-dollar bills that still came on her birthday. Each time, she felt as if she were winking, their eyes meeting over the decades, seeing something true in each other.</p><p>Rose had once dated a woman who’d had a whole other life—a marriage, two kids. “You’ve always known who you were,” she’d said, when Rose had talked about high-school girlfriends and coming out to her mother in the car home after a tonsillectomy, still high on painkillers. Her mother had just pulled into a drive-through to buy her a milkshake and said, “Oh sweetie, I know. We’ve known for a while, haven’t we?”</p><p>“I envy that,” the old girlfriend had said. “It must have made life so much easier.”<span data-page="page_2"></span></p><p>“It’s never easy,” Rose had said, meaning life in general, or romance, or sex, or relationships. She’d realized only later that the woman had simply meant self-knowledge, and that had been easy for Rose; it had come plainly and she’d never wanted to deny it, never felt she could. Vera’s story was beautiful and sad to her—how long it had taken to find Bev, to find herself. It was a story that had allowed Rose to love her grandmother less complicatedly than her mother had been able to. After Vera died, of a heart attack, about as suddenly as a seventy-three-year-old woman can die, Rose flew in from Portland for the week, partly because she knew that her mother wouldn’t.</p><p>Rose rented a car at Phoenix Sky Harbor and drove to the house in Sun City. But when Bev showed her into Vera’s room there was only one person’s clothes in the closet, and a tightly made single bed with rough white pillowcases. “I’m across the hall,” Bev said, then peered more closely at whatever expression was on Rose’s face. “She didn’t actually die in here, you know. It happened at the hospital.”</p><p>Bev explained that she’d already paid for a booth at a local consignment store. Vera’s stuff had to be out of the house by the end of the week. “I’ll need another roommate,” Bev said. “The homeowner-association fees out here are something else.” Vera herself was a brown cardboard box on the dresser, dangerously like the pile of mail left sitting beside it, the sales pitches and charity pleas that had arrived after her death. “I suppose you’ll be taking this back to Portland,” Bev said, holding it up for inspection.</p><p>“Unless you want it here,” Rose offered, carefully.</p><p>“You’re family and it’s yours. And why would I?”</p><p>Roommate. Rose had assumed in those Christmas letters that it was a euphemism. But maybe it wasn’t.</p><p>The other bedroom door had been closed since Rose arrived. Bev disappeared into it every night after dinner to play the most miserable country album Rose had ever heard. A woman’s lone howl crawled out from under the door, and Rose thought that if she listened hard enough she’d eventually hear Bev crying along. But Bev popped out each morning clear-eyed and so brusque that Rose couldn’t imagine just asking her, putting her question into words that Bev could laugh or take offense at or just deny.</p><p>Bev gave up on a tangle of necklaces and pushed the clot of metal across the coffee table. “I’m going for my swim,” she announced. “You said you’d call U-Haul about her furniture.” Rose picked at the clasps until she heard the sliding door to the back yard open and shut. Then she sneaked toward the kitchen window. She hunkered down, her arms in the sink, her head as close to the windowsill as she could get and still see the back-yard pool.</p><p>Bev couldn’t actually swim. She got from side to side somehow, but with wild movements of her arms and great gasps of breath. Sometimes she turned onto her back and shot a flute of water into the air as if from a whale’s blowhole. At the edge of the pool she pulled herself up with an elbow, the flesh of her upper arm spreading over the concrete. She caught her breath, practiced a stroke one-armed, hung on to the side, and kicked her legs. Put her face back into the water and blew delicate bubbles. Then she set off back across and it looked exactly the same, her strokes a broken windmill, her hips swivelling, water spraying three feet up on the concrete deck. It was the worst swimming Rose had ever seen, and it was the best entertainment of the past three days.</p><p>After fifteen minutes, Bev climbed out of the pool and Rose ran back to the living room, dropped to the carpet, and grabbed the necklaces. “Doesn’t look like you’ve made much progress,” Bev said, closing the sliding door behind her. A gulp of outside air came in with her, hot enough to reach Rose in the living room but already dissipating, a flame thankfully snuffed. Bev stood in her swimsuit, dripping a puddle onto the tiled floor. Rose shrugged. Bev tucked her towel around her waist. “The swimming. Can’t ever stop learning. That’s when you die. Anyway, you going to make us some dinner? Something other than eggs.”</p><p>Rose wanted to protest, but Bev was already down the hallway. Behind her bedroom door, the miserable country album started up again. A banjo twanged and the singer howled. Rose thought of her first girlfriend. She’d left lyrics in Rose’s locker, written out like poems. Some were about love, but most were about suicide. They’d put on a CD and smoke pot and try to feel more than their lives at the time had given them to feel. Rose listened and pretended she was the girl that her mother must have envisioned when naming her. She imagined the beauty, imagined the thorns. Dark things were the deepest. Every teen-ager knew that, gay or straight.</p><p>The singer in Bev’s bedroom shrieked as if something were biting her. “I’m going to the store!” Rose shouted.</p><p>Bev had the single song on repeat, too loud to hear or answer, and Rose thought that if she’d owned this album as a sixteen-year-old she<span data-page="page_3"></span> might have hurt herself for real.</p><p>Rose’s mother worked at the U.S.A. Dry Pea and Lentil Council trade group. She was the kind of admin who prided herself on being able to merge across five distribution lists, kick the vending machine in the right place to free a stuck soda, and fix a paycheck, all at 4:55 <em class="small">P.M.</em> on a Friday. Iris had worked fifty weeks a year for thirty years and counting. One week of vacation she used to take Rose somewhere edifying, a national park or a historic battlefield. One week she went to Cabo San Lucas alone. There were plenty of men in her life, usually one at a time for a few months each, but they never went with her. Iris had used Rose as her excuse—single parenthood, the need to not let her little girl fall too hard for men who might not last. But Rose never fell too hard for anyone.</p><p>During Iris’s vacations, Rose stayed with Grandma Vera, who took her bowling and made cookies with ingredients seemingly left over from the last time Rose had visited, the brown sugar crusted into jagged points at the bottom of the bag.</p><p>“What does your mom do all week in Cabo? I mean, the same vacation, every year. If I had the money to go somewhere, I’d try to actually see something. I’d see the world.” Vera rolled the dough into balls as if she were annoyed with it, and pressed them onto the baking sheet so firmly that Rose knew they’d spread too much and burn. The first batch was already out of the oven, brown and crispy. Rose ate them anyway. “Your mother’s wasted her life,” Vera said. “She was a smart girl, and she’s wasted it with those pea people.”</p><p>Rose went very still, chewing her cookie as quietly as she could. She felt as if a wild animal were coming into view, a dangerous specimen that her mother knew but Rose rarely saw. She imagined the hushed voice of a nature-program narrator, excitedly announcing the find. The Old Vera had been a drinker. The Old Vera had been sharp-tongued, quick to insult, frequently cruel. Iris avoided talking about the angry version—she could acknowledge Vera’s newer self without quite wanting a relationship with it, or believing that she could manage one.</p><p>“Don’t you waste your life, too,” Vera used to tell her. “Not like your mother.”</p><p>She didn’t think she had, but she suspected Vera might: mid-twenties, tending bar, no college degree, no marriage, no children. Her mother had sent Vera the reviews of all the places Rose worked. They almost never mentioned the drinks, but her mother would find something, like “attentive service,” to run a pink highlighter across. They had all figured out a way to live around, rather than directly with, one another—the restaurant reviews mailed to Vera, the notes of congratulations that Vera then sent to Rose. It was a careful dance around one another’s loyalties. The most recent review was in a still sealed envelope, piled on Vera’s dresser with the rest of her mail. Rose was mentioned by name, as the “mixologist and mastermind behind the exquisitely crafted cocktails.” Rose stuck the review in the mirror frame and pretended that her grandmother had had the chance to read it. Looking at it, posted above the blank brown box, felt like both vindication and disappointment.</p><p>Whatever big goals Vera might have had for herself remained a mystery. She didn’t seem especially proud of any one ability or accomplishment, her family included. Moving in with Bev had seemed like an explanation that justified everything, misbehavior and devotion both. But if Vera had died alone, surrounded by Kokopellis and pictures of someone else’s grandchildren, with a roommate, a guinea pig, and an estranged daughter, then what was her excuse? How angry was her life, and how small, there at the end, if it was without love?</p><p>In late afternoon, the heat was every possible cliché: blast furnace, oven, kiln, campfire, house fire. Rose’s jeans were marshy before she’d even pulled out of the driveway, and at the Safeway she lingered as long as she could, buying food and a two-dollar pair of flip-flops, her feet suffocating in sneakers. Her mom called while she was stalling in the magazine aisle, actually reading <em>Us Weekly</em> instead of just flipping through the pictures of celebrity cellulite. “I still don’t hate myself,” Iris announced as soon as Rose picked up. “I’m still not coming.”</p><p>“O.K.”</p><p>“How are things?”</p><p>“Weird.”</p><p>“Is Bev there? Can you not talk?”</p><p>“I’m at the grocery store.”</p><p>“How are things going?”</p><p>“Weird. Did you know they didn’t—”</p><p>“My therapist says he thinks it’s fine if I don’t go. He said people grieve in their own way. Or don’t. I don’t know yet if I’m grieving. But I’m not coming down.”</p><p>“I wasn’t asking you to.”</p><p>“You don’t know what she was like.”</p><p>“No.” Rose put <em>Us Weekly</em> back on the rack. “I don’t. I really don’t.”</p><p>“I just wanted to check in. I have aerobics. I’m outside the studio right now.”</p><p>“Then go inside.”</p><p>“O.K., I’m going. I’m going,” she said, and hung up.</p><p>Rose looked for a circuitous route home, which wasn’t hard. Sun City was a giant suburban hamster maze. In one of the strip malls, she spotted a red<span data-page="page_4"></span> sign that read “BevMo!” She turned into the parking lot. She could get Bev something with the name, a labelled bag or a business card. Maybe she would find it endearing. Maybe she’d tell Rose the truth. The store turned out to be a giant liquor emporium, and Rose felt foolish asking for just a bag, so she grabbed a bottle of vodka. There was no liquor in Vera’s house. Rose had looked.</p><p>At home, Bev had pulled all the dishes out of the cupboards, wrapped half of them in newspaper, and stuffed them in boxes on the counter. Rose had to put her three bags of groceries on the floor. “I thought you were hungry,” she said.</p><p>“I am.”</p><p>“Should we do this later, then?”</p><p>“I’ve already started. No point in putting them all back just to pull them out again.”</p><p>“Do you want me to help?”</p><p>“You don’t know what was whose.”</p><p>“I’m pretty hungry.”</p><p>“So order in, if you don’t think you can wait.” Bev’s hair was wet from the shower, and Rose realized how much longer it had got since all those pictures of her with a blunt cut, in overalls. It spread across her shoulders, the damp gray strands soaking the fabric, saturating the colors and pressing the pattern against her skin. The combination of dark-pink peonies, thin hair, and freckled skin looked vulnerable in a way that the rest of Bev didn’t.</p><p>“I brought you this.” Rose unfolded the BevMo! bag and snapped it in the air like a matador’s cape. “It reminded me of your name.” The bottle of vodka was in the glove compartment of the rental car.</p><p>Bev looked at it for a long time. She was holding a beige mug labelled “CardioFunRun ’89,” and Rose tried to imagine what possible incarnation of either Bev or Vera, in any decade, went running. “What’d you buy?”</p><p>“Nothing. Just the bag.”</p><p>“Too bad,” Bev said. She wrapped the FunRun mug in a piece of newspaper and then put it in the BevMo! bag, consignment-store bound. She picked up a plastic Hamburglar cup and tossed that in, too. Rose took the hint, and let her clatter around by herself until there was enough room to cook. The meal was as quick as she could make it—broccoli and instant mashed potatoes and two chicken breasts. She was just waiting on the chicken when her cell phone rang.</p><p>“I’m done with aerobics,” her mother announced. “Headed home.” Rose could hear the murmur of Top Forty radio, and pictured the dusty dashboard of Iris’s ancient Honda Civic, purple travel mug in the cup holder. “Can you talk?”</p><p>“No.” Bev was in the living room. The news was starting—sweeps for illegal immigrants—and Bev talked out loud to the television: “About time.”</p><p>“Bev’s there?”</p><p>“Yup.”</p><p>“Sorry I couldn’t talk earlier.”</p><p>The tick of the oven timer sounded hoarse as it slipped into its last minutes. Rose held the phone between her ear and her shoulder, and rummaged through the giveaways. At the bottom of a box there was a melamine plate with her own face on it, age eight. She was wearing a Care Bears sweatshirt and had fluffy bangs. She remembered her mom having the plates made, and her grandmother talking about how tacky it was that she’d worn a branded shirt for her school picture. “You should make those animals pay you,” she had said, “if you’re going to wear ’em across your chest.”</p><p>“You’re sure there’s nothing you want?” Rose asked. “There’s nothing I should be saving for you? Grandma had a lot of stuff.”</p><p>“For the millionth time, no. Let Bev take whatever she wants, take whatever you want, and get rid of everything else.”</p><p>“She doesn’t want anything.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“She—never mind. I’ll call you later.” Bev came back into the kitchen and poured them two glasses of water, straight from the tap. The water tasted so foul that the city distributed brochures with tips for drinking it. Add lemon slices, they recommended. Rose pulled a water bottle from one of the grocery bags and carried it with the plates into the living room. She ate off her own portrait, uncovering it bit by bit. There was Brave Heart Lion, from the Forest of Feelings. There was her toothy smile. She arranged the last of the potatoes into a white hat on her head and waited for Bev to apologize for just dumping this plate in a consignment box without even offering it to her. But Bev seemed determined to ignore her completely. They ate in silence until the news had dwindled to the dangers of leaving pets in hot cars and the weather—it would cool off later that week, the weatherman said, down to 109°. Bev ate with Cline in her lap, passing him shreds of broccoli. Finally, she put down her fork with a clank of finality and waited for Rose to look at her. When she did, Rose didn’t understand why Bev looked so angry. “Your grandmother knew, you know. She knew what you were,” Bev said.</p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p>“She didn’t mind. I wanted you to know that. She forgave you.” Bev handed the last of the broccoli to Cline and then fingered her necklace, rubbing the little cross, the gold disappearing between her fingers.</p><p>“<em>What I am</em>?”</p><p>“She didn’t hate you, or anything.”</p><p>“For being a bartender?” Rose tried to<span data-page="page_5"></span> joke.</p><p>“Oh, she hated that you were a bartender. Said you were wasting your life. Those stupid reviews your mother sent. But that’s not what I mean. You know what I mean.”</p><p>Rose ate the last few bites of potatoes, thinking something would come to her. Nothing did. She climbed over the guinea-pig gate and threw her plate into the sink so hard it shattered.</p><p>She grabbed her bag and her two-dollar flip-flops and headed out the front door, Bev calling after her. It was dark and the air was cooler, but the heat still radiated from the sidewalk, birthing itself off the pavement. She sat in the rental car and opened the warm bottle of vodka. She thought about where she might go, what she might do, and decided that what she really wanted to do was drink so much that she shouldn’t drive anywhere. So she got out and started walking. She wandered the development’s endless curves, its wide streets and low, sunbaked houses. People went to bed early here, and the homes were dark and quiet. The cheap flip-flops rubbed her feet, and when she came to the golf course she cut across the seventh hole. She tried to take her shoes off, but the grass was deceptive—dyed green, it was nearly dead underfoot, brittle and so sharp it hurt to walk on. Rose sat in a sand trap and buried her feet to soothe them. The vodka was an obscure brand she’d decided to try, but it turned out there was a reason she’d never had it before. It tasted like a mouthful of dirty glass, and she wished for tonic—or vermouth, olive brine, and a shaker. She wanted to be back behind the bar, where the problems were always everybody else’s and all she had to do was listen. Or, better yet, she wanted someone to listen to her, a Rolodex of old customers who could be made to return the favor. She wished she weren’t between girlfriends, just to have someone to call. She’d always let go of people so easily; it had made her feel strong, but now it made her feel like Bev—careless, callous, inscrutable.</p><p>Her phone rang, and in trying to answer she got sand all over it. “Should I come down there?” her mother asked, her voice sounding choked. “Just tell me. You’d tell me if I should, right?”</p><p>“Do you want to? You should come if you want to.”</p><p>“Don’t give me a choice, because I’ll say no.”</p><p>“I can’t tell you you need to come.”</p><p>“It matters. Of course it matters. I don’t want to pretend like it doesn’t.”</p><p>“Mom.”</p><p>“I didn’t realize. . . I didn’t realize until . . . I should be there.”</p><p>“You don’t need to be. It’s fine.”</p><p>“I hated her. I hated her for a long time, and I can’t take that back.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“I was picturing you doing to me what I’m doing to her. When I imagine you not caring, it’s the worst feeling in the world.”</p><p>“Mom. That won’t happen.”</p><p>“Your father’s the one. ‘If the two of you make each other that miserable, why keep doing this?’ he said. And that made so much sense.”</p><p>“Then don’t apologize for what made you happy.”</p><p>“But she’s family, Rose. Sometimes you aren’t supposed to be happy.”</p><p>“Maybe that’s not healthy.”</p><p>“I just— When you asked if there was anything I wanted? There is something. There was this necklace she used to wear. Real delicate, just a little gold cross with a diamond in it. She had it since I was little, when Daddy was still alive. I remember that. Have you seen it?”</p><p>Rose pressed her palm into the sand as if she could leave some kind of mark: her fingerprints on a golf course, her face on a plate. The phone was sweaty in her hand.</p><p>“If you see it, can you take it for me? I don’t think she would have gotten rid of it. It’ll be in the house somewhere.”</p><p>“I’m sure it is,” Rose said. She pressed her feet deeper, and the sand stuck to the raw places. She could see the dark lines in the moonlight, sandal straps of blood and grit.</p><p>As Rose opened the door, she steeled herself for Bev’s awful sad song, but there was only silence. The swamp-cooler air hissed through the sealed house, racing out the open door. Rose shut it behind her and stood still, breathing deeply, sobering up slightly in the cold. There was a strange scrabbling noise somewhere, as if Cline had grown to enormous size. Rose kicked off the flip-flops, wincing at the fresh blood between her toes, and went padding through the house. She found Bev in Vera’s room, lying on the bed. The hem of her peony housedress was hitched above her knees, her body curled tightly above her pale, dimpled legs. She was crying. Cline wandered over the coverlet down by Bev’s feet, with no interest in comforting his mistress, or no idea how. The Hamburglar cup was on the nightstand, full of soda. Whiskey and Coke, Rose recognized, lifting it and smelling. Bev looked up at her, and Rose felt suddenly powerful. Bev took one of the pillows from under her head and held it across her face. “She was a good friend to me,” Bev<span data-page="page_6"></span> said. “I know she could be sharp, but she was a good friend.”</p><p>Rose pulled the pillow off and dropped it on the floor, but Bev grabbed the other one and pressed it more tightly over her head. “I never did,” she said. “I never slept here before. In this bed.”</p><p>Rose set the vodka bottle down on the nightstand and sat beside her; the mattress creaked. She reached out and touched the necklace with a single finger, the pendant so slight that she couldn’t help but touch Bev, too, her warm skin beneath. Bev flinched, and lifted the pillow long enough to take the Hamburglar cup. She tried to drink flat on her back and coughed, liquid spilling into the gullies of her neck and running down the gold chain. She pushed the cup back into Rose’s hand and replaced the pillow. “You should ask me,” she said, her voice muffled. “Just ask me what you want to know.”</p><p>“Was she happy?” The question came to Rose as a kindness, a way of easing Bev into greater confessions, but as she asked it felt like something she needed very much to know.</p><p>“I don’t know. I wish I did.” Bev curled on her side, then lifted the pillow enough to reach for the cup again. “Ask me if I’m happy.”</p><p>“Are you happy?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Rose took the drink from Bev’s hand. “You’re cut off. Robble robble.” She set it on the nightstand, drunk enough herself that the liquid sloshed in the cup.</p><p>“I should have said something. I wish we’d— But she could be so hard. You know how hard, your grandma.” Her fingers reached for the cup and closed around air. “Give it back.”</p><p>“Where did it come from?”</p><p>“My bedroom. Vera didn’t drink. Said she used to like it a little too much.”</p><p>Rose could feel Bev’s warmth against her back. “That’s what my mom always said. I don’t know. I didn’t see that part of her. She’d stopped before I came along.”</p><p>“You never really know. The things a person doesn’t want to show you.”</p><p>“Even the things they do,” Rose said, and she was drunk enough that it felt very wise, but it still sounded helpless. Tucked in a corner of the mirror was a snapshot of Bev and Vera at the zoo. She wondered if Bev had noticed it, if it made her feel better or worse. She wished it were framed. She wished there were a heart drawn around it in lipstick, something irrefutable, something Bev could see and know that she’d been seen after all. The brown box sat mutely beneath it.</p><p>Bev braced her arm on Rose’s thigh and worked herself upright, leaning back against the headboard. “I took—” She gripped the necklace. Then she noticed Rose’s feet. “That has to hurt. You should wash them.”</p><p>“I will. Later.”</p><p>But the moment was gone. Bev took the Hamburglar cup again, and Rose didn’t stop her. “I didn’t want to tempt her,” Bev said. “But I’m not a woman that likes to do without.”</p><p>“I like that about you,” Rose said, honestly. Bev took the bottle of vodka from the nightstand and poured some into the cup. “That’s going to taste disgusting,” Rose said.</p><p>“I don’t care.”</p><p>“I care. Shut up,” she said, as Bev opened her mouth to protest. “Let me make you something.”</p><p>She got up and walked unsteadily across the hall to Bev’s room, through the open door. There were more pictures of grandchildren on the dresser, a music stand, and an accordion. The bed was unmade, the sheets pink with a nubbly chenille coverlet. A cardboard box filled with bottles had been dragged halfway out of the closet. Rose hefted the whole thing up, and then heard the CD player hissing on top of the dresser. It was cued up, paused at the beginning of a track, the disk whirling, waiting. She pressed Play. Blood calls to blood, calls to the wound, the singer howled. Bones long to be broken.</p><p>In the kitchen, Bev had cleaned up the supper dishes and the giveaways. Rose set the box on the counter with a satisfying clank. She pulled out every bottle, seeing what she had to work with. Some were nearly crusted shut, but she wrenched them open, one by one. She pulled every bottle of juice, every soda, every can of frozen concentrate from the fridge. She pulled every glass, every mug left in the cupboards and placed them all on the counter. She began to pour.</p><p>The sliding door opened and shut behind her. She looked out the sink window and saw Bev with Cline under one arm, Vera’s box under the other. Rose worried that they were all going in, but Bev set the box down gently on the patio table, and Cline on the concrete rim. She turned on the pool lights and then leaped into the water with a splash that hit Cline like a tsunami. He stayed loyally put. Bev threw herself across the water, over and over. At the far side of the pool, she paused, her housedress ballooning around her. She looked like a magnificent pink squid. The cross glittered at her neck. Rose opened the sliding door. The heat rushed in like wind. Bev had opened her bedroom window, and the sad song was circling the back yard.</p><p>“You can have<span data-page="page_final"></span> it,” Rose said.</p><p>“What?” Bev gasped, out of breath.</p><p>“You can have it.”</p><p>Bev shook her head, confused, droplets flying from her hair. She pointed at her ears. “Water,” she said, and stuck her index finger in like popping a balloon. “What are you making?” she called.</p><p>Rose held up her finger, meaning “wait,” although in a loud bar it would just mean “one,” and you never told customers to wait. She chose two glasses and carried them out, jewel-bright, showy, with floating, separated layers. If you looked closely, you could see the layers already collapsing together. The heat wrapped around her, a living, tireless thing, laughing at the dark. Sweat sprang from her face, her neck, under her arms. She stood at the pool’s edge, and Bev surged toward her. “Get your feet in here,” she said, and Rose put the drinks on the concrete, rolled up her jeans, and sat, legs dangling.</p><p>She offered Bev a glass. As Bev reached for it with her right hand, her left slipped off the pool edge and grabbed at Rose’s leg, her grip urgent. Rose took Bev’s weight, buoyed by the water, and Bev rested for a moment, hooking her fingers in the damp rolled cuff of Rose’s jeans. They looked at her feet, the blood and sand lifting off into the blue and drifting away. Then Bev pushed off, the water churning as she threw herself toward the wall a few feet away. She turned and looked back at Rose, her drink held safe and high above the water. It looked as if Bev were proposing a toast, and Rose raised her glass.</p><p>“Medicine,” she offered, and they drank, as if it might be some kind of cure. ♦</p>	Caitlin Horrocks	October 24, 2011 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/10/24/sun-city	Alcohol	Bartenders	Country Music	Daughters	Death	Grandmothers	Rose	Third	Death
The Apologizer	<p>It was the month of June, the morning sun was emerging from the clouds, and Alain was walking slowly down a Paris street. He observed the young girls: every one of them showed her naked navel between trousers belted very low and a T-shirt cut very short. He was captivated, captivated and even disturbed: it was as if their seductive power resided no longer in their thighs, their buttocks, or their breasts but in that small round hole at the center of the body.</p><p>This provoked him to reflect: if a man (or an era) sees the thighs as the center of female seductive power, how does one describe and define the particularity of that erotic orientation? He improvised an answer: the length of the thighs is the metaphoric image of the long, fascinating road (which is why the thighs must be long) that leads to erotic achievement. Indeed, Alain said to himself, even in mid-coitus the length of the thighs endows woman with the romantic magic of the inaccessible.</p><p>If a man (or an era) sees the buttocks as the center of female seductive power, how does one describe and define the particularity of that erotic orientation? He improvised an answer: brutality, high spirits, the shortest road to the goal, a goal that is all the more exciting for being double.</p><p>If a man (or an era) sees the breasts as the center of female seductive power, how does one describe and define the particularity of that erotic orientation? He improvised an answer: sanctification of woman, the Virgin Mary suckling Jesus, the male sex on its knees before the noble mission of the female sex.</p><p>But how does one define the eroticism of a man (or an era) that sees female seductive power as centered in the middle of the body, in the navel?</p><p>So: ambling along the streets, he would often think about the navel, untroubled at repeating himself, and even strangely obstinate about doing so, for the navel woke in him a distant memory: the memory of his last encounter with his mother.</p><p>He was ten at the time. He and his father were alone on vacation, in a rented villa with a garden and a swimming pool. It was the first time that she had come to see them after an absence of several years. They closed themselves into the villa, she and her former husband. For miles around, the atmosphere was stifling from it. How long did she stay? Probably not more than an hour or two, during which time Alain tried to entertain himself in the pool. He had just climbed out when she paused there to say her goodbyes. She was alone. What did they say to each other? He doesn’t know. He remembers only that she was sitting on a garden chair and that he, in his still-wet bathing trunks, stood facing her. What they said is forgotten, but one moment is fixed in his memory, a concrete moment, sharply etched: from her chair, she gazed intently at her son’s navel. He still feels that gaze on his belly. A gaze that was difficult to understand: it seemed to him to express an inexplicable mix of compassion and contempt; the mother’s lips had taken the shape of a smile (a smile of compassion and contempt together); then, without rising from the chair, she leaned toward him and, with her index finger, touched his navel. Immediately afterward, she stood up, kissed him (did she really kiss him? probably, but he is not sure), and was gone. He never saw her again.</p><p>A small car moves along the road beside a river. The chilly morning air makes even more forlorn the charmless terrain, somewhere between the end of a suburb and open country, where houses grow scarce and no pedestrians are to be seen. The car stops at the side of the road; a woman gets out—young, quite beautiful. A strange thing: she pushes the door shut so negligently that the car must not be locked. What is the meaning of that negligence, so improbable these days with thieves about? Is the woman so distracted?</p><p>No, she doesn’t seem distracted; on the contrary, determination is visible on her face. This woman knows what she wants. This woman is pure will. She walks some hundred yards along the road, toward a bridge over the river, a rather high, narrow bridge, forbidden to vehicles. She steps onto it and heads toward the far bank. Several times she looks around, not like a woman expected by someone but to be sure that there is no one expecting her. Midway across the bridge, she stops. At first glance she appears to be hesitating, but, no, it’s not hesitation or a sudden flagging of determination; on the contrary, it’s a pause to sharpen her concentration, to make her will steelier yet. Her will? To be more precise: her hatred. Yes, the pause that looked like hesitation is actually an appeal to her hatred to stand by her, to support her, not to desert her for an instant.</p><p>She lifts a leg over the railing and flings herself into the void. At the end of her fall, she slams brutally against the hardness of the water’s surface and is paralyzed by<span data-page="page_2"></span> the cold, but after a few long seconds she lifts her face, and since she is a good swimmer all her automatic responses surge forward against her will to die. She plunges her head under again, forces herself to inhale water, to block her breathing. Suddenly, she hears a shout. A shout from the far bank. Someone has seen her. She understands that dying will not be easy, and that her greatest enemy will be not her good swimmer’s irrepressible reflex but a person she had not figured on. She will have to fight. Fight to rescue her death.</p><p>She looks over toward the shout. Someone has leaped into the river. She considers: who will be quicker, she, in her resolve to stay underwater, to take in water, to drown herself, or he, the oncoming figure? When she is half-drowned, with water in her lungs and thus weakened, won’t she be all the easier prey for her savior? He will pull her toward the bank, lay her out on the ground, force the water out of her lungs, apply mouth-to-mouth, call the rescue squad, the police, and she will be saved and ridiculed forevermore.</p><p>“Stop! Stop!” the man shouts.</p><p>Everything has changed. Instead of diving down beneath the water, she raises her head and breathes deeply to collect her strength. He is already in front of her. It’s a young fellow, a teenager, who hopes to be famous, to have his picture in the papers. He just keeps repeating, “Stop! Stop!” He’s already reaching a hand toward her, and she, rather than evading it, grasps it, grips it tight, and pulls it (and him) down toward the depths of the river. Again he cries, “Stop!” as if it were the only word he can speak. But he will not speak it again. She holds on to his arm, draws him toward the bottom, then stretches the whole length of her body along the boy’s back to keep his head underwater. He fights back, he thrashes, he has already inhaled water, he tries to strike the woman, but she stays lying firmly on top of him; he cannot lift his head to get air, and after several long, very long, seconds he ceases to move. She holds him like that for a while; it is as if, exhausted and trembling, she were resting, laid out along him. Then, convinced that the man beneath her will not stir again, she lets go of him and turns away, toward the riverbank she came from, so as not to preserve within her even the shadow of what has just occurred.</p><p>But what’s going on? Has she forgotten her resolve? Why does she not drown herself, since the person who tried to rob her of her death is no longer alive? Why, now that she is free, does she no longer seek to die?</p><p>Life unexpectedly recovered has been a kind of shock that broke her determination; she has lost the strength to concentrate her energy on dying. She is shaking, suddenly stripped of any will, any vigor; mechanically, she swims toward the place where she abandoned the car.</p><p>Little by little, she feels the water grow less deep, she touches her feet to the riverbed, she stands; she loses her shoes in the mud and hasn’t the strength to search for them; she leaves the water barefoot and climbs the bank to the road.</p><p>The rediscovered world has an inhospitable appearance, and suddenly anxiety seizes her: she hasn’t got the car key! Where is it? Her skirt has no pockets.</p><p>Heading for your death, you don’t worry about what you’ve dropped along the way. When she left the car, the future did not exist. She had nothing to hide. Whereas now, suddenly, she has to hide everything. Leave no trace. Her anxiety grows stronger and stronger: Where is the key? How to get home?</p><p>She reaches the car, she pulls at the door, and, to her astonishment, it opens. The key awaits her, abandoned on the dashboard. She sits at the wheel and sets her naked feet on the pedals. She is still shaking. Now she is shaking with cold as well. Her shirt, her skirt, are drenched, with dirty river water running everywhere. She turns the key and drives off.</p><p>The person who tried to impose life on her has died from drowning, and the person she was trying to kill in her belly is still alive. The idea of suicide is ruled out forever. No repeats. The young man is dead, the fetus is alive, and she will do all she can to keep anyone from discovering what has happened. She is shaking, and her will revives; she thinks of nothing but her immediate future: How to get out of the car without being seen? How to slip, unnoticed, in her dripping clothes, past the concierge’s window?</p><p>Alain felt a violent blow on his shoulder. “Watch out, you idiot!”</p><p>He turned and saw a girl passing him on the sidewalk with a rapid, energetic stride.</p><p>“Sorry!” he cried after her (in his frail voice).</p><p>“Asshole!” she answered (in her strong voice) without turning around.</p><p>Alone in his studio apartment two days later, Alain noticed that he was still feeling pain<span data-page="page_3"></span> in his shoulder, and he decided that the young woman who had jostled him in the street so effectively must have done it on purpose. He could not forget her strident voice calling him “idiot,” and he heard again his own supplicating “Sorry,” followed by the answering “Asshole!” Once again, he had apologized over nothing! Why always this stupid reflex of begging pardon? The memory would not leave him, and he felt he had to talk to someone. He called his girlfriend, Madeleine. She wasn’t in Paris, and her cell phone was off. So he punched in Charles’s number, and no sooner did he hear his friend’s voice than he apologized. “Don’t be angry. I’m in a very bad mood. I need to talk.”</p><p>“It’s a good moment. I’m in a foul mood, too. But why are you?”</p><p>“Because I’m angry with myself. Why is it that I find every opportunity to feel guilty?”</p><p>“That’s not so awful.”</p><p>“Feeling guilty or not feeling guilty—I think that’s the whole issue. Life is a struggle of all against all. It’s a known fact. But how does that struggle work in a society that’s more or less civilized? People can’t just attack each other on sight. So instead they try to cast the shame of culpability on each other. The person who manages to make the other one guilty will win. The one who confesses his crime will lose. You’re walking along the street, lost in thought. Along comes a girl, walking straight ahead, as if she were the only person in the world, looking neither left nor right. You jostle each other. And there it is, the moment of truth: Who’s going to bawl out the other person, and who’s going to apologize? It’s a classic situation: actually, each of them is both the jostled and the jostler. And yet some people always—immediately, spontaneously—consider themselves the jostlers, and thus in the wrong. And others always—immediately, spontaneously—consider themselves the jostled, and therefore in the right, quick to accuse the other and get him punished. What about you—in that situation, would you apologize or accuse?”</p><p>“Me, I’d certainly apologize.”</p><p>“Ah, my poor friend, so you, too, belong to the army of apologizers. You expect to mollify the other person with your apologies.”</p><p>“Absolutely.”</p><p>“And you’re wrong. The person who apologizes is declaring himself guilty. And if you declare yourself guilty you encourage the other to go on insulting you, blaming you, publicly, unto death. Such are the inevitable consequences of the first apology.”</p><p>“That’s true. One should not apologize. And yet I prefer a world where everyone would apologize, with no exception, pointlessly, excessively, for nothing at all, where they’d load themselves down with apologies.”</p><p>Alain picked up his cell phone to call Madeleine again. But hers rang and rang in vain. As he often did at similar moments, he turned his attention to a photograph hanging on his wall. There was no photograph in his studio but that one: the face of a young woman—his mother.</p><p>A few months after Alain’s birth, she had left her husband, who, given his discreet ways, had never spoken ill of her. He was a subtle, gentle man. The child did not understand how a woman could have abandoned a man so subtle and gentle, and understood even less how she could have abandoned her son, who was also (as he was aware) since childhood (if not since his conception) a subtle, gentle person.</p><p>“Where does she live?” he had asked his father.</p><p>“Probably in America.”</p><p>“What do you mean, ‘probably’?”</p><p>“I don’t know her address.”</p><p>“But it’s her duty to give it to you.”</p><p>“She has no duty to me.”</p><p>“But to me? She doesn’t want to hear news of me? She doesn’t want to know what I’m doing? She doesn’t want to know that I think about her?”</p><p>One day, the father lost control.</p><p>“Since you insist, I’ll tell you: your mother never wanted you to be born. She never wanted you to be around here, to be burying yourself in that easy chair where you’re so comfortable. She wanted nothing to do with you. So now do you understand?”</p><p>The father was not an aggressive man. But, despite his great reserve, he had not managed to hide his profound disagreement with a woman who had tried to keep a human being from coming into the world.</p><p>I have already described Alain’s last encounter with his mother, beside the swimming pool of a rented vacation house. He was ten at the time. He was sixteen when his father died. A few days after the funeral, he tore a photograph of his mother out of a family album, had it framed, and hung it on his wall. Why was there no picture of his father in his apartment? I don’t know. Is that illogical? Certainly. Unfair? Without a doubt. But that’s how it is. On the walls of his studio, there hung only a single photograph: the one of his mother. With which, from time to time, he would talk.</p><p>“Why didn’t you have an abortion? Did he stop you?”</p><p>A voice came to him from the photograph: “You’ll never know that. Everything you imagine about me is just fairy tales. But I love your fairy tales. Even when you made me out to be<span data-page="page_4"></span> a murderer who drowned a young man in the river. I liked it all. Keep it up, Alain. Tell me a story! Go on, imagine! I’m listening.”</p><p>And Alain imagined. He imagined the father on his mother’s body. Before their coitus, she’d warned him: “I didn’t take the pill, be careful!” He reassured her. So she makes love without mistrust, then, when she sees the signs of climax appear on the man’s face and grow, she cries, “Watch out!” then “No! No! I don’t want to! I don’t want to!” But the man’s face is redder and redder, red and repugnant; she pushes at the heavier weight of this body clamping her against it, she fights, but he wraps her still tighter, and she suddenly understands that for him this is not the blindness of passion but will—cold, premeditated will—while for her it is more than will, it is hatred, a hatred all the more ferocious because the battle is lost.</p><p>This was not the first time Alain had imagined their coitus; this coitus hypnotized him and caused him to suppose that every human being was the exact replica of the instant of its conception. He stood at his mirror and examined his face for traces of the double, simultaneous hatreds that had led to his birth: the man’s hatred and the woman’s hatred at the moment of the man’s orgasm, the hatred of the gentle and physically strong coupled with the hatred of the courageous and physically weak.</p><p>And he reflects that the fruit of that double hatred could only be an apologizer. He was gentle and intelligent like his father; and he would always be an intruder, as his mother had viewed him. A person who is both an intruder and gentle is condemned, by an implacable logic, to apologize throughout his whole life. He looked at the face hanging on the wall and once again he saw the woman who, defeated, in her dripping dress, gets into the car, slips unnoticed past the concierge’s window, climbs the staircase, and, barefoot, returns to the apartment where she will stay until the intruder leaves her body. And where, a few months later, she will abandon the two of them.</p><p>Alain was sitting on the floor of his studio, leaning against the wall, his head bent low: Perhaps he had dozed off? A female voice woke him.</p><p>“I like everything you’ve said to me so far, I like everything you’re inventing, and I have nothing to add. Except, maybe, about the navel. To your mind, the model of a navel-less woman is an angel. For me, it’s Eve, the first woman. She was born not out of a belly but out of a whim, the Creator’s whim. It was from her vulva, the vulva of a navel-less woman, that the first umbilical cord emerged. If I’m to believe the Bible, other cords, too: with a little man or a little woman attached to each of them. Men’s bodies were left with no continuation, completely useless, whereas from out of the sexual organ of every woman there came another cord, with another woman or man at the end of each one, and all of that, millions and millions of times over, turned into an enormous tree, a tree formed from the infinity of bodies, a tree whose branches reached to the sky. Imagine! That gigantic tree is rooted in the vulva of one little woman, the first woman, poor navel-less Eve.</p><p>“When I got pregnant, I saw myself as a part of that tree, dangling from one of its cords, and you, not yet born—I imagined you floating in the void, hooked to the cord coming out of my body, and from then on I dreamed of an assassin way down below, slashing the throat of the navel-less woman. I imagined her body in death throes, decomposing, until that whole enormous tree that grew out of her—now suddenly without roots, without a base—started to fall. I saw the infinite spread of its branches come down like a gigantic cloudburst, and—understand me—what I was dreaming of wasn’t the end of human history, the abolition of any future; no, no, what I wanted was the total disappearance of mankind, together with its future and its past, with its beginning and its end, along with the whole span of its existence, with all its memory, with Nero and Napoleon, with Buddha and Jesus. I wanted the total annihilation of the tree that was rooted in the little navel-less belly of some stupid first woman who didn’t know what she was doing or what horrors we’d pay for her miserable coitus, which had certainly not given her the slightest pleasure.”</p><p>The mother’s voice went silent, and Alain, leaning against the wall, dozed off again.</p><p>The next morning, at about eleven, Alain was to meet with his friends Ramon and Caliban in front of the museum near the Luxembourg Gardens. Before he left his studio, he turned back to say goodbye to his mother in the photograph. Then he went down to the street and walked toward his motorbike, which was parked not far from his apartment.</p><p>As he straddled the bike, he had the vague sensation of a body leaning against his back. As if Madeleine were with him<span data-page="page_final"></span> and touching him lightly. The illusion moved him; it seemed to express the love he felt for his girl. He started the engine.</p><p>Then he heard a voice behind him: “I wanted to talk some more.”</p><p>No, it wasn’t Madeleine; he recognized his mother’s voice.</p><p>Traffic was slow, and he heard: “I want to be sure that there’s no confusion between you and me, that we understand each other completely—”</p><p>He had to brake. A pedestrian had slipped between cars to cross the street and turned toward Alain with a threatening gesture.</p><p>“I’ll be frank. I’ve always felt that it’s horrible to send a person into the world who didn’t ask to be there.”</p><p>“I know,” Alain said.</p><p>“Look around you. Of all the people you see, no one is here by his own wish. Of course, what I just said is the most banal truth there is. So banal, and so basic, that we’ve stopped seeing it and hearing it.”</p><p>For several minutes he kept to a lane between a truck and a car that were pressing him from either side.</p><p>“Everyone jabbers about human rights. What a joke! Your existence isn’t founded on any right. They don’t even allow you to end your life by your own choice, these defenders of human rights.”</p><p>The light at the intersection went red. He stopped. Pedestrians from both sides of the street set out toward the opposite sidewalk.</p><p>And the mother went on: “Look at them all! Look! At least half the people you’re seeing are ugly. Being ugly—is that one of the human rights, too? And do you know what it is to carry your ugliness with you through your whole life? With not a moment of relief? Or your sex? You never chose that. Or the color of your eyes? Or your era on earth? Or your country? Or your mother? None of the things that matter. The rights a person can have involve only pointless things, for which there is no reason to fight or to write great declarations!”</p><p>He was driving again now, and his mother’s voice grew gentler. “You’re here as you are because I was weak. That was my fault. Forgive me.”</p><p>Alain was silent; then he said, in a quiet voice: “What is it that you feel guilty for? For not having had the strength to prevent my birth? Or for not reconciling yourself to my life, which, as it happens, is actually not so bad?”</p><p>After a silence, she answered, “Maybe you’re right. Then I’m doubly guilty.”</p><p>“I’m the one who should apologize,” Alain said. “I dropped into your life like a cow turd. I chased you away to America.”</p><p>“Quit your apologies! What do you know about my life, my little idiot! Can I call you idiot? Yes, don’t be angry; in my own opinion, you are an idiot! And you know where your idiocy comes from? From your goodness! Your ridiculous goodness!”</p><p>He reached the Luxembourg Gardens. He parked the bike.</p><p>“Don’t protest, and let me apologize,” he said. “I’m an apologizer. That’s the way you made me, you and he. And, as such, as an apologizer, I’m happy. I feel good when we apologize to each other, you and I. Isn’t it lovely, apologizing to each other?”</p><p>Then they walked toward the museum. ♦</p><p><em>(Translated, from the French, by Linda Asher.)</em></p>	Milan Kundera	May 4, 2015 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-apologizer	Birth	Death	Drowning	Eve	Mothers	Photographs	Alain 	Third	Death
The Beach Boy	<p>The <span data-page="page_1"></span>friends met for dinner, as they did the second Sunday of every month, at a small Italian restaurant on the Upper East Side. There were three couples: Marty and Barbara, Jerry and Maureen, and John and Marcia, who had recently returned from a weeklong island getaway to celebrate their twenty-ninth wedding anniversary. “Were the beaches beautiful? How was the hotel? Was it safe? Was it memorable? Was it worth the money?” the friends asked.</p><p>Marcia said, “You had to see it to believe it. The ocean was like bathwater. The sunsets? Better than any painting. But the political situation, don’t get me started. All the beggars!” She put a hand over her heart and sipped her wine. “Who knows who’s in charge? It’s utter chaos. Meanwhile, the people all speak <em>English!</em> ” The vestiges of colonialism, the poverty, the corruption—it had all depressed her. “And we were harassed,” she told the friends. “By prostitutes. <em>Male</em> ones. They followed us down the beach like cats. The strangest thing. But the beach <em>was</em> absolutely gorgeous. Right, John?”</p><p><em><strong>Audio:</strong></em> Ottessa Moshfegh reads.</p><p>John sat across the table, swirling his spaghetti. He glanced up at Marcia, nodded, winked.</p><p>The friends wanted to know what the prostitutes had looked like, how they’d dressed, what they’d said. They wanted details.</p><p>“They looked like normal people,” Marcia said, shrugging. “You know, just young, poor people, locals. But they were very complimentary. They kept saying, ‘Hello, nice people. Massage? Nice massage for nice people?’ ”</p><p>“Little did they know!” John joked, furrowing his eyebrows like a maniac. The friends laughed.</p><p>“We’d read about it in the guidebook,” Marcia said. “You’re not supposed to acknowledge them at all. You don’t even look them in the eye. If you do, they’ll never leave you alone. The beach boys. The male prostitutes, I mean. It’s <em>sad</em>,” she added. “Tragic. And, really, one wonders how anybody can starve in a place like that. There was food everywhere. Fruit on every tree. I just don’t understand it. And the city was rife with garbage. _Rife! _” she proclaimed. She put down her fork. “Wouldn’t you say, hon?”</p><p>“I wouldn’t say ‘rife,’ ” John answered, wiping the corners of his mouth with his cloth napkin. “Fragrant, more like.”</p><p>The waiter collected the unfinished plates of pasta, then returned and took their orders of cheesecake and pie and decaffeinated coffee. John was quiet. He scrolled through photos on his cell phone, looking for a picture he’d taken of a monkey seated on the head of a Virgin Mary statue. The statue was painted in bright colors, and its nose was chipped, showing the white, chalky plaster under the paint. The monkey was black and skinny, with wide-spaced, neurotic eyes. Its tail curled under Mary’s chin. John turned the screen of his phone toward the table.</p><p>“This little guy,” he said.</p><p>“Aw!” the friends cried. They wanted to know, “Were the monkeys feral? Were they smelly? Are the people Catholic? Are they all very religious there?”</p><p>“Catholic,” Marcia said, nodding. “And the monkeys were everywhere. Cute but very sneaky. One of them stole John’s pen right out of his pocket.” She rattled off whatever facts she could remember from the nature tour they’d taken. “I think there are laws about eating the monkeys. I’m not so sure. They all spoke English,” she repeated, “but sometimes it was hard to understand them. The <em>guides</em>, I mean, not the monkeys.” She chuckled.</p><p>“The monkeys spoke Russian, naturally,” John said, and put away his phone.</p><p>The table talk moved on to plans for renovating kitchens, summer shares, friends’ divorces, new movies, books, politics, sodium, and cholesterol. They drank the coffees, ate the desserts. John peeled the wrapper off a roll of antacids. Marcia showed off her new wristwatch, which she’d purchased duty-free at the airport. Then she reapplied her lipstick in the reflection in her water glass. When the check came, they all did the math, divvying up the cost. Finally, they paid and went out onto the street and the women hugged and the men shook hands.</p><p>“Welcome home,” Jerry said. “Back to civilization.”</p><p>“Ooh-ooh ah-ah!” John cried, imitating a monkey.</p><p>“Jesus, John,” Marcia whispered, blushing and batting the air with her hand as if shooing a fly.</p><p>Each couple went off in a different direction. John was a bit drunk. He’d finished Marcia’s second glass of wine because she’d said it was giving her a headache. He took her arm as they turned the corner onto East Eighty-second Street toward the Park. The streets were nearly empty, late as it was. The whole city felt hushed, focussed, like a young dancer counting her steps.</p><p>Marcia fussed with her silk scarf, also purchased duty-free at the airport. The pattern was a paisley print in red and black and emerald green and had reminded her of the vibrant colors she’d seen the locals wearing on the island. Now she regretted buying the scarf. The tassels were short and fuzzy, and she thought they made the silk look cheap. She could give the scarf away as a gift, she supposed, but to whom? It had been so expensive, and her closest friends—the only people she would ever spend so much money on—had just seen her wearing it. She sighed and looked up at the moon as they entered the Park.</p><p>“Thank God Jerry and Maureen<span data-page="page_2"></span> are getting along again,” Marcia said. “It was exhausting when they weren’t.”</p><p>“Marty was funny about the wine, wasn’t he?” John said. “I told him I was fine with Syrah. What does it matter? <em>Que sera</em>, <em>sera</em>.” He unhooked his arm from Marcia’s elbow and put it around her shoulder.</p><p>“It gave me such a headache,” Marcia complained. “Should we cut across the field, or go around?”</p><p>“Let’s be bold.”</p><p>They stepped off the gravel onto the grass. It was a dark, clear night in the Park, quiet except for the sound of distant car horns and ripping motors echoing faintly through the trees. John tried for a moment to forget that the city was right there, surrounding them. He’d been disappointed by how quickly his life had returned to normal after the vacation. As before, he woke up in the morning, saw patients all day long, returned home to eat dinner with Marcia, watched the evening news, bathed, and went to bed. It was a good life, of course. He wasn’t suffering from a grave illness; he wasn’t starving; he wasn’t being exploited or enslaved. But, gazing out the window of the tour bus on the island, he had felt envious of the locals, of their ability to do whatever was in their nature. His own struggles seemed like petty complications, meaningless snags in the dull itinerary that was his life. Why couldn’t he live by instinct and appetite, be primitive, be free?</p><p>At a rest stop, John had watched a dog covered in mange and bleeding pustules rub itself against a worn wooden signpost. He was lucky, he thought, not to be that dog. And then he felt ashamed of his privilege and his discontentedness. “I should be happy,” he told himself. “<em>Marcia</em> is.” Even the beggars tapping on car windows, begging for pennies, were smiling. “Hello, nice people,” the beach boys had said. John had wanted to return their salutations and ask what it was that they had to offer. He’d been curious. But Marcia had shushed him, taken his hand, and plodded down the beach with her eyes fixed on the blank sand.</p><p>Crossing the lawn in Central Park, John now tried to recall the precise rhythm of the crashing waves on the beach on the island, the smell of the ocean, the magic and the danger he’d sensed brewing under the surface of things. But it was impossible. This was New York City. When he was in it, it was the only place on earth. He looked up. The moon was just a sliver, a comma, a single eyelash in the dark, starless sky.</p><p>“I forgot to call Lenore,” Marcia was saying as they walked. “Remind me tomorrow. She’ll be upset if I don’t call. She’s so uptight.”</p><p>They reached the edge of the lawn and stepped onto a paved path that led them up to a bridge over a plaza, where people were dancing in pairs to traditional Chinese music. John and Marcia stopped to watch the dark shapes moving in the soft light of lanterns. A young man on a skateboard rumbled past them.</p><p>“Home sweet home,” Marcia said.</p><p>John yawned and tightened his arm around her shoulder. The silk of Marcia’s scarf was slippery, like cool water rippling between his fingers. He leaned over and kissed her forehead. There she was, his wife of nearly thirty years. As they walked on, he thought of how pretty she’d been when they were first married. In all their years together, he had never been interested in other women, had never strayed, had even refused the advances of a colleague one night, a few years ago, at a conference in Baltimore. The woman had been twenty years his junior, and when she invited him up to her room John had blushed and made a stuttering apology, then spent the rest of the evening on the phone with Marcia. “What did she expect from me?” he’d asked. “Some kind of sex adventure?”</p><p>“We can watch that movie when we get home,” Marcia said as they reached the edge of the Park. “The one about the jazz musician.”</p><p>“Whatever you like,” John said. He yawned again.</p><p>“Maureen said it was worth watching.”</p><p>“It’s unconscionable what they are doing to you, Eduardo,” Marcia said to the doorman in the lobby of their building. The doormen were petitioning management to provide a proper chair for them to sit in. All they had now was a tall stool with no back. “To have to stand for that many hours, doesn’t that constitute torture? John is going to have a word with them. They’ll do something. They have to.” Marcia pulled the silk scarf from her neck and folded it in her hands.</p><p>Eduardo leaned on his little podium, propped his chin in his hand. “How was the vacation?” he asked.</p><p>“Oh, it was wonderful, wonderful. Everything. I mean, the seafood was just beyond compare! The ocean was like bathwater,” Marcia answered. “And now we’re utterly exhausted.”</p><p>“Jet-lagged,” John said.</p><p>Eduardo tapped his pen on the podium. “When I go home to my country, it’s the same. I don’t sleep.”</p><p>“Yes, it’s rough. Well, good night,” Marcia sang.</p><p>She and John climbed the wide marble stairs to their second-floor apartment. They’d lived in the building for twenty-six years. They could have navigated their way through the<span data-page="page_3"></span> lobby and up the stairs in complete darkness, and had, in fact, done so during a blackout one summer when all of Manhattan lost power for a night. Marcia had enjoyed it. They’d lit candles, eaten the ice cream that was going to melt anyway, and talked.</p><p>Now they walked down the bright, wallpapered hallway, and John unlocked the door to their apartment. Inside, there was still a stack of unopened mail on the front table, a blinking red light on the answering machine, a smell of mothballs from the closet where Marcia had been looking for her squash racket earlier that day. “I want to get it restrung <em>now</em>,” she’d insisted, “before it’s too late.”</p><p>“Too late for what?” John had asked.</p><p>“For when someone asks me to play.”</p><p>John had stood and watched his wife’s bottom wiggle as she stooped down into the depths of the closet. She was in remarkable shape for a woman in her fifties. She often teased John that he needed to start taking better care of himself. “I’m going to make it to a hundred and five. You don’t want me to have to replace you, do you?”</p><p>“You’d have no problem, I’m sure,” John answered.</p><p>It was true. People liked Marcia. All of John and Marcia’s friends were really friends of <em>hers</em>. John sometimes felt as if he were just a strange appendage to his wife. Surely she could have done better—a brain surgeon, a lawyer, a physicist. Had he given her the life she deserved? They did take a trip every year, usually in late summer to celebrate their anniversary, but that was all. They’d never had children. John had never won any awards.</p><p>“I’m going to take a Tylenol for my headache,” Marcia said. “Want to get the movie set up?” She shut the closet door and ran her fingers across the squash racket, which now lay on the table in the hallway.</p><p>“Will you eat popcorn?” John asked.</p><p>“I really shouldn’t. But if you’re making some . . .” Her voice trailed off as she walked down the hallway to the bathroom, flicking on the lights and rubbing her temples.</p><p>John went to the kitchen and got the jar of popcorn kernels down from the cupboard. He liked to make popcorn the old-fashioned way, in a big steel pot with a long metal arm that stirred the kernels. He lit the stove, melted the margarine, poured the popcorn in, and stood over the pot with his eyes closed, turning the handle slowly and feeling the warm air rise toward him, remembering moments on the island when the sun on his face had struck him as so hot, so intimate, it was like Marcia’s breath on his cheek.</p><p>As the kernels began to pop, he brought his ear to the lid of the pot, closer to the heat and the noise. The irregular staccato made his pulse speed up. The heart fascinated him. Sometimes he liked to put his ear to Marcia’s chest and listen. Her heartbeat was light and chatty, a rhythm that made you want to waltz around the kitchen. John could have been a cardiologist, but he’d pursued dermatology instead. At parties, he wowed people with descriptions of boils and rashes and growths, strange hair patterns, nasty scars, pus-filled cysts, bizarre freckles, cancers, moles. “Within six feet of this fellow, you could detect the distinct smell of porcini risotto,” he’d say. “His armpit was filled with fungus.” At the stove, John righted himself, continued to stir the popcorn with one hand, and took his own pulse with two fingers of the other, pressing on his throat and breathing slowly until his heart rate returned to normal.</p><p>Meanwhile, Marcia took two extra-strength Tylenol, splashed some cold water on her face, brushed her teeth, and went to sit on the leather sofa in front of the television in the living room. A sudden excruciating pain in her head made her vision blurry. It was as if she’d been plunged underwater, the room murky and muffled, and she couldn’t breathe. She tried to call out to John. “Honey? John?” She could only gasp. Her throat gurgled, her hands trembled, and then she died. It was that simple. She was gone.</p><p>When all was quiet, John turned off the stove and poured the popcorn into a wooden salad bowl. He carried the bowl and the saltshaker into the living room, sat down next to Marcia’s dead body, salted the popcorn, ate several handfuls, and turned on the television. “Which movie did you say?” he asked her, scrolling through the pay-per-view listings. He looked at her downturned face. Her head hung to one side, resting on her shoulder. John smoothed her hair, put a hand on her knee for a moment, changed the channel to the baseball game, lowered the volume, ate the rest of the popcorn, then fell asleep beside her.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Mr. John,” Eduardo said in the lobby, as the body was wheeled out early the next morning. John nodded, still in shock, having woken up and discovered Marcia, cold and limp, slumped across the couch beside him. He followed the E.M.T.s out onto the street and watched them load her into the back of the ambulance and drive away, the siren blaring—but for what? “She’s already dead!” John cried out after them. Eduardo took him by the<span data-page="page_4"></span> arm and led him back inside and up to the apartment. A neighbor brought him some water from the kitchen. The glass, a souvenir from a cruise that he and Marcia had taken through the fjords of Norway, retained a faint smear of her berry-colored lipstick on its rim. John put his mouth on it and sipped.</p><p>The memorial service was a week later. The chapel ceiling at St. Ignatius was vaulted and painted a cornflower blue with spiky white stars. The carpet was dark red, with a jagged gold pattern that reminded John of shattered glass. Marcia’s friends filled the pews. They moaned and wept. Maureen and Barbara embraced John and held his hands and babbled all at once, drowning out the few words he had to say as he took his seat in the front pew. He dabbed at his eyes with old tissues he found squirrelled away in the breast pocket of his suit.</p><p>Several friends told stories, boasting about how much Marcia had meant to them, how deeply she’d touched their lives. Marcia would have liked it, John thought—all these people discussing her, pointing out her best qualities, remembering her finest moments. She’d have eaten it up. But what did these people really know about her? What <em>could</em> one know about a person? John had known her best of all, had been able to predict her every move, the arc of her sighs, her laughs, the twists of her shadow as it crossed a room. In the days since her death, he’d felt her drifting through the apartment. He’d done double takes the way you do when you think you see your own cat or dog begging for food under the table at a restaurant. Nobody would understand, John thought, how well he knew the sound of Marcia’s coffee spoon hitting the saucer, how the sheets rustled around her when she turned over in bed. But were those things significant enough, he wondered, to boast about?</p><p>When it was his turn to get up, John spoke of their recent trip to the island. “She was so happy there,” he said. “So <em>alive</em>.” He paused, waiting for a laugh, but there was none. He looked out at the crowd, all those drawn, wrinkled faces wet with emotion. He could imagine Marcia sitting among them, already composing her opinion of the speech he was giving. “He was terribly overcome,” he imagined her saying to her friends over coffee and cake at the reception. “You could see him really straining to get something across. To no avail, I’m afraid. Well, that’s John. Not the best talker. But that’s why we got along so well.”</p><p>John leaned against the lectern for balance, trying to think of interesting memories to relate. “The seafood,” he began to say, but stopped himself. It all seemed so trite. “Why tell stories?” he wondered aloud. “As soon as something is over, that’s it. Why revive it constantly? Things happen, and then more things, inevitably, happen next. So?” He shrugged. His hands trembled. He tried to smile, but he was now, indeed, terribly overcome. He left the lectern, tripping down the shallow steps. He felt as he did when he was gassed at the dentist’s office—disoriented, befuddled. “Eduardo?” John called out. He staggered drunkenly. His secretary came up and guided him back to his seat.</p><p>Maureen took the stage next and recited what she claimed was one of Marcia’s favorite poems. John pulled the last crumpled tissue from his breast pocket. He found a tiny wishbone wrapped up inside it. He recalled a dermatology-conference dinner, where quail had been served, a few years earlier. He’d planned on bringing the wishbone home so that he and Marcia could make a wish together. John always wished for whatever Marcia wished for. “This way, we both win,” he said. Now he pulled the bone from the tissue and held it in his hand as he dried his tears. Poor Marcia, he thought. She could have wished for everlasting life.</p><p>“We passed the fields of gazing grain, we passed the setting sun,” Maureen was saying, her voice swelling and shaking in a way that she must have rehearsed for days, John thought. He’d always secretly hated Maureen. Her tireless obsession with rain-forest conservation confounded him. The woman was from White Plains, for Christ’s sake. He would not miss Maureen, or any of Marcia’s friends, for that matter. “Poor Marcia, she really loved you, you know,” Barbara had told him before the memorial. Of course he knew that Marcia loved him. They’d been married for nearly thirty years. People feel so special, so wise, when somebody they know drops dead. “We’d just seen her at dinner,” he’d heard Maureen telling someone. “And to think, just a few hours later, she was gone forever. Isn’t life strange?”</p><p>But life wasn’t strange at all. Marcia’s sudden death was the strangest thing that had ever happened to John. And even that wasn’t very strange. People died all the time, in fact. As he crushed the tiny wishbone in his fist, it cracked into pointy shards that poked into the skin of his palm like needles. “Since then ’tis centuries; but each feels shorter than the day,” Maureen continued. John shook his head at this nonsense. Listening to the stupid woman revel in the spotlight made him ill. He held his<span data-page="page_5"></span> bleeding hand over his heart, feeling it pound like an axe through a thick wooden door. His throat clenched with what—sorrow? Was that all it was? He scoffed at how small that seemed. Then something seemed to break inside him. His breath caught. He choked and coughed. The wild thumping of his heart stopped. He belched loudly, from the depths of his gut, as though releasing some dark spirit that had been lodged down there his whole life. His secretary laid a hand on his shoulder. “Excuse me,” John said, wiping saliva from his mouth. When he looked up again, Maureen’s poem was over. He straightened in his seat and felt his heart start back up. Its beat was now soft and aimless, like a baby’s babbling. He was calm, he thought. He was fine.</p><p>Next, Marcia’s choir group took the stage and began to sing an old Negro spiritual. They sang lifelessly, as though the song didn’t mean anything to them. Perhaps it didn’t. John rose and walked up the aisle to the bathroom at the back of the chapel. He blew his nose for a while in the stall, urinated, defecated, then flushed the broken wishbone down the toilet.</p><p>A week later, John still had not returned to work. He spent his days in silence, eating duty-free Ferrero Rocher chocolates and bouncing the strings of Marcia’s squash racket against his skull. He paced the apartment, his mind empty but for the bits of music he heard from cars passing on the street outside. Or he sat on the leather sofa in front of the muted television, which was showing back-to-back episodes of true-crime docudramas. People liked to kill one another, it seemed, on speedboats. Aliases, disguises, offshore bank accounts—these notions began to pepper John’s mind. With Marcia gone, perhaps he could fill his remaining years with criminal pursuits, he thought. He was too clumsy to be a cat burglar. But couldn’t he stalk someone? Or vandalize something? Library books? The back seats of taxis? Easiest would be to send death threats to someone he despised—Maureen, perhaps. He could do that without even leaving the apartment. He winced at his cowardice. At every stage of his life he’d been reasonable, dutiful. He’d prescribed creams, lanced cysts, cut plantar warts out of the rubbery soles of smelly feet. Once, he’d pulled a seven-foot coil of ingrown hair from an abscess on the tip of a patient’s tailbone. That was as wild as it got for John. He’d never been in a fight. His body bore no scars. The hands now folded in his lap were bland, beige, wrinkled in all the predictable ways.</p><p>The spot he’d chosen for the urn of Marcia’s ashes was on a shelf in the kitchen, next to the coffee grinder and the mini food processor that she had used expressly for guacamole. “The secret is to freeze it first,” he recalled her saying. Or was that something else? John didn’t care. He’d had enough of what people said, tips and tales, theories, tidbits. If he could have it his way, nobody would ever say anything again. The entire world would go silent. Even the clocks wouldn’t tick. All that mattered would be the beating of hearts, the widening and narrowing of pupils, the whirling of ties and loose strands of hair in the wind—nothing voluntary, nothing false. He opened the fridge and peeled back the tinfoil from a dish one of the friends had brought over. Fat from the chicken had congealed into a dun-colored jelly. He stuck his finger in it, just to feel the cold gunk.</p><p>Then the phone rang.</p><p>“And?” is how John answered. The voice on the line was a recording from the local convenience store. Marcia’s photos had been printed and were ready to be picked up. She’d used a disposable camera on their trip to the island. John hung up the phone. Marcia’s purse was where she’d left it, on the table in the hallway. He rifled through and found the claim stub in her wallet. Without changing out of his pajamas, he put on a jacket and shoes and went down to the lobby.</p><p>“How are you, Mr. John?” Eduardo asked. He followed John to the door and opened it, his black rubber shoes squeaking on the polished marble floor.</p><p>John didn’t answer. He had nothing to say. He let his head hang and plodded slowly down the block. He didn’t care if people thought he looked forlorn or deranged. Let them judge. Let them entertain themselves with their stories, he thought.</p><p>At the convenience store, he went to the counter and pulled out the claim stub. When the shopgirl asked for his last name, he handed over his business card. ****</p><p>“Can you confirm the home address?” she asked.</p><p>John shook his head.</p><p>The girl rolled her eyes. “Are you deaf or something?” she asked.</p><p>“Maaa, haa,” John said. He ground his jaws and pointed to his ears.</p><p>“O.K.,” the girl said, softening. She held up a finger. “One minute.”</p><p>John nodded. Why would she need to confirm his address, anyway? What kind of impostor would want someone else’s photographs? Someone with a speedboat, perhaps. John laughed at himself. “Maaa, haa,” he said again.</p><p>“I’m sorry, sir. I can’t understand you,” the girl said. She slid the packet of photos across the counter and pointed to<span data-page="page_6"></span> the glowing numbers on the cash register’s display screen. She held up her forefinger and thumb and rubbed them together. “Money,” she said. “<em>Dinero</em>.”</p><p>“Gaaah,” John said. He handed her the cash, then grunted. The girl waved goodbye cheerfully. If Marcia could see him now, acting like some kind of Frankenstein, she’d laugh, John thought.</p><p>He pulled the photos from their sleeve and shuffled through them on the way home. There were half a dozen shots of ocean waves, the horizon, and several street scenes, each interrupted by the splatter of bird shit on the car window through which they’d been taken. Nothing looked as beautiful as it had in real life. The people, the buildings, the beach—it was all flat and dull, despite the glossy finish of the photo paper. There was a closeup of cocktails served in coconuts and decorated with toothpick-speared chunks of pineapple and orange slices and Maraschino cherries, colorful paper umbrellas, curlicue straws. On either side of the frame were the brown, deeply lined hands of the server holding the raffia tray. There was a shot of Marcia’s ankles, her feet plunged deep into the pale-gray sand. It had been gritty, soft, dry volcanic ash, like what was left of Marcia in the urn in the kitchen, John supposed. There were a few photos of the pool snapped from the balcony of their hotel room, a blurry shot of John on his cell phone in the lobby, one of John shaking hands with a tiny monkey in the forest, John shaking hands with the nature guide, John eating a platter of crabs. There was only one photo of Marcia, a self-portrait taken in the reflection of the vanity mirror in the hotel bathroom. She smiled coquettishly in her berry-colored lipstick, her face a floating mask above the white orb of the flash.</p><p>The final photo in the set seemed to be an extra, a half-exposure at the end of the roll. The right side of the picture was gray, empty. A red line went down the center like a burn mark. The left side showed the grainy landscape of the beach at night, and, in the bottom corner, the top half of a face. It belonged to a local, a native. A beach boy, John presumed, one of those male prostitutes. The dark skin appeared almost black in the dimness of the picture. Only the whites of the eyes glistened, almost yellow, like hanging lanterns. Marcia had taken the photo by accident, John supposed. But when had she come so close to a beach boy? She’d made such a fuss about keeping her distance. During that first walk, when the beach boys had followed them, Marcia had hurried back to the hotel grounds and insisted vehemently that John look away. “If you make eye contact, it’s like an invitation,” she’d said.</p><p>“To what?” John had asked.</p><p>“To a party you wouldn’t like,” she’d answered, “and that you’d have to pay for.”</p><p>“Would <em>you</em> like it?” he’d asked. He’d been joking, of course. Marcia had said nothing.</p><p>“Hello, nice people? Hello?”</p><p>At home, John found Marcia’s magnifying glass in her bedside drawer. He sat down, turned on the lamp, and held the magnifying glass over the beach boy’s eyes, hoping he might find some kind of explanation reflected in them. Had Marcia been unfaithful? Had she been pretending, as long as John had known her, to be a prude? He craned his neck and brought his own eye closer and closer to the photo, squinting, straining every muscle until he found something he took to be a sign, an invitation—a single red pixel in the darkness of the boy’s right pupil.</p><p>Back on the island, John stood once again in the hotel lobby. The overnight flight had been bumpy. He hadn’t slept at all. The radio in the hotel shuttle from the airport had warned of hurricane-force gales, possible flooding, thunder, lightning. A murky bank of clouds crept slowly but steadily across the sky.</p><p>“Will we have to evacuate?” John asked.</p><p>The desk attendant rubbed her eyes. “Maybe, sir. They don’t tell us anything.” She slid John’s room key across the counter. Behind the check-in desk, the clerks were talking and yawning and sharing small cookies from a grease-soaked paper bag. John remembered the cookies from a tour of the market on the other side of the island. The guide had explained to him and Marcia that the cookies were made not from flour but from some native root vegetable, molasses, and butter that came from goat’s milk. A sack of twenty cookies cost less than a dollar.</p><p>“Can you imagine?” Marcia had whispered.</p><p>John had hoped that the guide would arrange for them to try some, but they’d simply idled by the vender’s cart, Marcia covering her mouth and nose with a tissue, while the guide chatted with a passerby in the local patois. <em>Rife</em>, John recalled now. The sights and sounds and smells of the market came back to him. There were bowls of spices and beans of every hue, hot goat’s milk poured from dirty metal teapots atop charcoal briquettes into small plastic cups like the ones John used at the dentist’s to rinse and spit. Hot smoke from cauldrons of roasting meat roiled across baskets of nuts and fruits, stacks of woven shawls that the women used<span data-page="page_7"></span> as slings to carry their babies on their backs, pyramids of pastel-colored toilet-paper rolls. In a dark corner of the market, they’d passed an old man, his eyes sky blue with cataracts. He sat behind a table full of empty Coke bottles and tin cans. Beside him was a rickety chest of drawers. When John asked what the man was selling, the guide answered “spiritual medicine,” twirled his finger in the air, and widened his eyes, as though to make fun of the crazy old man. “People in the villages believe in that nonsense,” the guide said. “They believe in magic. <em>Evil</em>.” He crossed himself and laughed, then yelled at a young girl who had splashed dirty water on his shoes while rolling her bike through a puddle on the path. One of Marcia’s photos had been of that market. The royal-blue plastic tarps covering the stalls appeared nearly black, like funeral shrouds. Recalling that image now gave John the chills. He’d told everyone back home that he was going to the island to scatter Marcia’s ashes. That was the excuse he gave.</p><p>As John unlocked the door of his hotel room, a family passed by him in the hall—parents with three sleepy children.</p><p>“Last flight back to the mainland,” the father said with a British accent, his arms full of gape-mouthed, plush toy monkeys.</p><p>John wasn’t very worried. The beach boys would not get swept away in any flood, he knew. He had spotted a few of them already on the drive from the hotel. For prostitutes, he thought, they seemed so relaxed walking along the road, so casual in their sun-bleached striped T-shirts, their rubber sandals grinding over the gray dirt. His plan was to find the boy from Marcia’s photo and do whatever she had done with him off in the dunes at night while he was sleeping. That would be revenge enough to set his heart at ease, he thought. It would be the strange thing that gave his life some meaning at last. It would be his life’s one adventure.</p><p>He inspected his hotel room, approving of the lone queen-size bed, the flat-screen mounted on the wall, the small window that looked out onto the beach. The sky had an eerie, vapid whiteness. John could see the red-tiled roof of the hotel’s al-fresco dining area and one corner of the fence that partitioned the beach. To get to a private spot where he could dump the ashes in the water, he’d have to go beyond that fence. A few beach boys sat perched in the dunes beyond the hotel, like exotic birds in their bright-colored shorts. Even with no sun to reflect off their taut dark-brown skin, their bare backs gleamed. If only he had Marcia’s opera glasses, John thought, he could see their faces.</p><p>The heavy-duty black plastic bag containing Marcia’s ashes had passed through customs undetected. Of course, John had left the metal urn at home. He figured that if anyone asked what the bag contained he’d say that it was medicinal bath salts to soak his feet in. But nobody questioned him. He took Marcia’s ashes out of his suitcase, carried the bag down to the empty dining room, selected a stale roll from the breakfast-buffet table, sat and ate it, and pocketed a knife from the place setting. He nodded and smiled at the hotel workers, who were busy shuttering the windows in preparation for the storm.</p><p>Outside, the wind whipped at John’s face, forcing him to pitch his head forward as he walked along the fence. Sand pricked at his skin like needles. As he approached the waves, the sky flashed. A moment later, thunder pealed long and deep, and a few cold drops of rain fell on his back. He crouched by the water and took out the knife. It was a cheap knife, with dull, wide serrations. The plastic of the bag was so thick that he had to place it on the sand, hold it down with one hand, and stab at it repeatedly. To keep the sand out of his eyes, he shut them. He thought one last time of Marcia, pictured her clucking her tongue at this indecorous ceremony. He thought of all the wishbone wishes he’d wasted on her petty desires: good seats at the movies, a trip to Vermont to see the foliage, a sale on cashmere sweaters or towels. And, secretly, all along she’d been a whore, he thought, a deviant, a pervert, carousing with prostitutes right under his nose! Meanwhile, she’d shushed him every time he’d said anything remotely off-color, as if anyone were paying attention, as if it even mattered. John tore at the hole he’d made in the plastic bag, crawled over the sand on his knees, felt for the water, and dumped the ashes out.</p><p>A mere hour later, the storm was over. The sky was gray, but the rain had stopped. Little damage had been done to the island, though the hotel had lost electricity. John’s room was dim. From his window, he watched the ocean pounding the beach in tall, floating waves, as the wind howled like a cartoon ghost in a haunted house, comically persistent. He stood and uselessly pressed the buttons on the TV remote, then stared at his reflection in the rectangular black screen. He was still wearing what he’d worn on<span data-page="page_final"></span> the overnight flight: his gray summer-weight wool trousers and a white linen dress shirt. The shirt was now crushed and wrinkled, the collar warped around his neck. His face was swollen, his ears full of sand. His graying hair lay in waxy tendrils around his face. He laughed at his slovenly appearance and tried to smooth his hair back, but the rain and the salt air had dried it into straw. He didn’t care. Marcia was gone for good now, and he felt like celebrating.</p><p>Downstairs in the empty restaurant, John took a seat on a barstool. Outside, workers were unfolding the shutters from the dining-room windows. The clouds over the ocean were paler and thinner than before. He ordered a Glenfiddich, saluted the bartender, and drank. “How much for the whole bottle?” John asked. “No, don’t tell me. Just charge it to my room.” He flashed the number on his key. A whole bottle just for him, out from under Marcia’s shaming gaze. Why had he let her control him like that? He’d lived his entire life on his best behavior, a slave to decorum. For what? John shook his head and poured himself more whiskey. He could do whatever he wanted now. He could buy a hundred goat-butter cookies. He could make all the crass jokes he liked. Through the windows, he saw the clouds part and the sun shine. The staff began to drag the lounge chairs and tables and umbrellas back onto the deck. A few large gulls coasted back and forth, low across the beach. John smacked his lips, slid off his barstool, and took the bottle of Glenfiddich down to the sand, carelessly kicking off his salt-stained leather loafers and peeling off his socks on the way. He walked around the hotel fence and along the shoreline for several minutes, well past the spot where he’d dumped Marcia’s ashes.</p><p>The sand was cool and hard under his feet. The waves were high and frothy still, but he could swim, he thought, chugging from the bottle. He looked around to see if anyone was watching. The beach was empty. He stuck the Glenfiddich in the sand, quickly removed his pants, and started sloshing into the warm, churning water. He waded in waist high, stiffening his body against the turbulent gushes, which seemed somehow gentle and powerful at once. He looked out at the horizon. This was what the beach was good for: staring out at the sea gave one the feeling of infinity. But it was an illusion, John thought. The sea wasn’t infinite. There was land on the other side. Wasn’t that always the truth about things? That they ended? How many more years did he have, at this point? Ten? Twenty? A powerful wave knocked him down, and when he righted himself and found his footing he was facing the shore. A beach boy in tiny, bright-red shorts stood on the sand, watching him. John waved and hollered “Hello!” just before the next wave pulled him under.</p><p>A few weeks later, telling the story over dinner, John would explain that the storm had kept him cooped up for days. “It barely made a dent, that storm. But everything shut down. You know these poor countries—there’s no infrastructure. Even if you did try to intervene and make some order, the people are all so superstitious, it would take a hundred years, with all their spells and blessings.”</p><p>“Well, I think it’s beautiful of you,” Maureen said, “to go back there, with Marcia.”</p><p>“She said it was heaven, after all,” Barbara said. “Didn’t she say that? That it was heaven?”</p><p>“She did say that, yes,” Maureen answered.</p><p>John put a hand over his heart, which was now broken by something he found far more interesting than a dead wife. His drunken jaunt on the beach had ended strangely. The beach boy, though not the one who’d appeared in Marcia’s photograph, had indeed been young and beautiful, his eyes yellow, his lips thick and glossy. He’d spotted John flailing in the undertow, pulled him from the water, and dragged him to shore. John had rolled onto his side, sputtering and gagging on the salt water he’d swallowed. The boy stood over him, his strong brown legs just inches from John’s naked body. “You saved me,” John managed to say. As he reached a hand out to grip the boy’s ankle, his fingers trembled. Some kind of force field seemed to surround the boy. He couldn’t be touched. When John held his palm over the boy’s foot, he could feel heat rising up. The boy took a step away. Perhaps he isn’t even real, John thought. But there he was. “Come here,” John demanded. “I need to ask you something.” He got onto his hands and knees, tried to stand, but he was too exhausted. He was drunk. He collapsed on the sand. The boy stood and stared for a while, then yawned, turned, and walked away. It was clear to him and to the other beach boys watching from their perch in the dunes that the old man wasn’t carrying any money. ♦</p>	Ottessa Moshfegh	January 4, 2016 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/01/04/the-beach-boy	Adulthood	Books	Caribbean	Couples	Death	Grief	John	Third	Death
The Color of Shadows	<p>Ali <span data-page="page_1"></span>Hyland, one of the neighbors in Enniscorthy, phoned Paul in Dublin to say that his aunt Josie, his father’s sister, had been found that morning on the floor, having fallen out of bed in the house where she lived alone; they thought that she had been lying there most of the night. An ambulance had come, Ali said, and taken Josie to Wexford hospital, ten miles away.</p><p>When Paul contacted the hospital, the nurse in charge of the ward said that his aunt was stable. He explained that he was busy at work and wondered if he might postpone his visit until the weekend, and the nurse told him that his aunt was in no immediate danger and it would be fine if he came on Saturday. He left a number, in case they needed to reach him. Later, he was phoned by a social worker, who said that she did not think his aunt could return to living alone; nor could she stay in the hospital indefinitely. She gave him a list of residences for the elderly in the Enniscorthy area; she refused to recommend one over another.</p><p>When Paul phoned Ali Hyland on the Friday of that week, she seemed unsurprised that the social worker wanted his aunt in a nursing home.</p><p>“She won’t go easily, that’s all I have to say.”</p><p>“Has anyone mentioned it to her before?” Paul asked.</p><p>“We all have, but she likes her independence.”</p><p>“Is there anywhere local that is good?” Paul asked.</p><p>“Noeleen Redmond and her husband have a place near Clohamon, and some people say that it’s lovely. Noeleen was a friend of your mother’s.”</p><p>Paul almost replied that he did not believe his aunt would want help from someone who had been a friend of his mother’s.</p><p>“Is there nobody else I could ask?”</p><p>Ali hesitated before she replied.</p><p>“That’s all long ago, Paul. It’s all long ago.”</p><p>“I know it is,” he said, “and I’m grateful for your help, Ali, so maybe I’ll call Noeleen Redmond now.”</p><p>“That would be the best, Paul.”</p><p>He arranged, having phoned Noeleen Redmond and explained the situation, to come and visit the new residence for senior citizens once he had seen his aunt. And then he drove the two-hour journey from Dublin down to the hospital.</p><p>“She won’t eat,” the nurse said to him as they both stood looking at his aunt, who was asleep.</p><p>“She eats well at home,” Paul said.</p><p>“She spat out her toast this morning.”</p><p>“That’s very unlike her.”</p><p>The nurse looked at him and shrugged.</p><p>“There’s nothing actually wrong with her. We did X-rays and everything.”</p><p>“She probably doesn’t like being in hospital.”</p><p>“Well, she’s lucky someone found her.”</p><p>He sat with her. After almost an hour, she turned and saw him.</p><p>“Oh, God,” she said.</p><p>“You’re all right.”</p><p>“I hate those nurses.”</p><p>“They’re awful,” he said. “You’re right.”</p><p>“I hate those nurses,” she repeated. It was clear to him that her hearing, which had improved after she had had her cataracts removed and the wax cleaned out of her ears, had now worsened again. “But they’d better not hear us or they’ll starve me altogether.”</p><p>“You were fast asleep when I came.”</p><p>“You were good to come down, but don’t say too much, now—they are all listening.”</p><p>She tried to sit up.</p><p>“Tell them I want a private room.”</p><p>“I’ll do that.”</p><p>“Tell them I want a private room in my own house.”</p><p>Once he’d made sure that she was comfortable, he drove to Enniscorthy, passed through the town, and turned off the Dublin road to Bunclody. It was a crisp early-winter day, and he was surprised, as he always was when he visited Enniscorthy, by the volume of traffic and the new roundabouts and the tiny scale of things that, when he was growing up, had seemed to him like monuments. This was what he still called home, he thought, but if his aunt was to go into a residence, then he might best begin thinking of his own house in Rathmines, in Dublin, as the only home he had.</p><p>He turned left, away from the Slaney, as he had been told to do, and then right again, and drove along a narrow road until he came to the nursing home, which had a large sign outside. Already, he could see, from the gardens and the layout, that the place was well kept, with a clear view of woodland and the soft light over the river.</p><p>Noeleen Redmond was waiting for him on the porch. She made him tea and said that she had a place free and he could move Josie in whenever he liked. When she told him the price per week, he thought for a moment that she meant per month. She spoke then about the cost of things, the amount of regulation there was, and how hard it was to keep staff. He tried to work out in his head how much Josie’s pension was, wondering also how much money she had saved, and thinking then about what her house was worth.</p><p>“She was very good to you, wasn’t she? And now she’s lucky to have you.”</p><p>Noeleen smiled at him warmly.</p><p>“She won’t feel lucky leaving her own house,” he said.</p><p>“She’ll be treated very well, and she’ll be well fed and warm here.”</p><p>“I might tell<span data-page="page_2"></span> her that it’s just for a while.”</p><p>“That might be best, all right.”</p><p>It was almost dark when the ambulance arrived with his aunt at the nursing home. He was waiting with Noeleen at the front door.</p><p>“You go in and they will make you a cup of tea,” Noeleen said to him. “We’ll come and find you when we have her comfortable.”</p><p>As he made his way to the dining room, he passed a large room with chairs all around the walls and figures sitting in them, none of them speaking or reading, some of them asleep or staring at a television that was blaring in the corner. He stood and looked at them, but then felt as if he were intruding on something strangely private and he moved on.</p><p>Directly outside the door to the dining room, there was a woman sitting in an armchair. He felt for a moment that he recognized her, knew her from childhood, but she was so old now and frail that it was hard to think who she was, or had been. Her gaze as he passed her was defiant, almost challenging. Whoever she was, he thought, she knew how to be difficult.</p><p>As he sat in the darkened dining room and drank his tea, he asked himself how long it would be before Josie would demand to be released from here. He wondered if there was another solution, if there was someone who could spend nights with her and call in to check on her throughout the day, and he thought that he would ask Ali Hyland when he next came down. There were a lot of new people in the town, Poles, Lithuanians, Latvians, Nigerians, and maybe there would be some woman whom he could pay to look after his aunt in her own house.</p><p>When Noeleen came to find him, she suggested that he merely tiptoe into the bedroom where his aunt was but not disturb her.</p><p>“We’ll find out what she likes,” Noeleen said, “and we’ll feed her. She needs to put on weight. And she’ll be asleep in no time. She’s not sure where she is.”</p><p>When Paul drove down from Dublin the following Saturday, he found his aunt in the large room with all the others. She was asleep, her head slumped. One of the nurses on duty carried in a chair for him, and he sat down in front of Josie and waited for her to wake up. Although there was a low sound coming from the television, there was a hush in the room, of which he became acutely conscious as he sat there.</p><p>When he looked behind him, he found that five or six old ladies were watching him, some suspiciously, others in a way that was too dulled to be menacing but was nonetheless unfriendly. It occurred to him that he could go and check Josie’s house, light a fire in the living room, maybe, and return later. But he resisted this impulse; he knew that it was really an urge to flee from this place and not have to deal with whatever his aunt had to say.</p><p>She smiled when she woke and saw him, and nodded her head.</p><p>“They said you’d be down,” she said. “You’re great to come down.”</p><p>“How are you?”</p><p>“Did you bring the car?”</p><p>“I drove down.”</p><p>She did not seem to hear him.</p><p>“Is the car outside?”</p><p>“I drove down.” He was aware as he raised his voice that everyone in the room could hear him.</p><p>“We’ll go so,” she said. “I knew you’d come. They all said you’d come. Do I have a bag or anything, or a case?”</p><p>“It’s very cold outside,” he said.</p><p>She looked at him, puzzled.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“It’s a freezing day.”</p><p>“I’d say that.” She smiled.</p><p>“You’re very warm in here.”</p><p>“Will you get me my coat?” She made to stand up.</p><p>Later, when she had been calmed by one of the nurses, he left her, promising to return the next day and saying nothing when she asked him if she would be leaving then, if he was coming back in the car then, to take her to her own house. He was aware as he turned and carried his chair back to where it had been that the roomful of inmates had heard every word that had passed between him and his aunt.</p><p>Noeleen was waiting for him in the hallway. As he sat in the dining room with her, she suggested that he get a set of forms from his aunt’s bank and her solicitor, which would give him power of attorney, or at least the power to deal with her financial affairs.</p><p>The house had a smell of damp and old cooking. As he stood in the downstairs room, he was amazed at how small everything was, not only the rooms themselves but the objects in them—the armchairs and the television in the corner of the front room, the dining-room table and chairs in the back room. Somehow, the place had shrunk in Josie’s absence. He remembered spending Christmas here in recent years and loving the coal fires lighting both rooms, the Christmas tree, the warmth of the place as he helped her package presents for neighbors and friends and later watched the television with her or helped her in the kitchen.</p><p>When he<span data-page="page_3"></span> went upstairs and looked at his old bedroom, he noticed how worn the carpet was and how the color on the wallpaper had faded. He must, he thought, have noticed this before, but now the room seemed shabby and strange, almost unfamiliar, and not the room he had slept in every night throughout his childhood, with the small desk in the corner where he did his homework.</p><p>Suddenly, he realized that he was dreading the night ahead in this house; he did not think he would sleep. When he went to look for sheets to put on his bed, he found a musty smell in the hot press. He turned away and walked down the stairs and made up his mind that he would search for Josie’s papers and bank statements and then he would go.</p><p>He made a call to the Riverside Hotel, and when they told him they had rooms free he said he would be there in an hour. Josie would hate the waste of money, and the thought that he might not want to spend the night in her house, but the idea of having to make up a bed for himself and try to sleep in this old room made him shiver. That’s all over now, he thought. He suppressed any urge to feel sorry for himself at losing it.</p><p>As he rummaged through papers on the shelf near the chair where Josie usually sat in the front room, a knock came at the door. He knew that it would be Ali Hyland, who would have seen the light on. He invited her into the front room and told her that Josie was unhappy and wanted to come home.</p><p>“It’s the same for all of them,” she said. “But they get used to it, or maybe they just stop complaining. But it’s a good place, although it isn’t cheap.”</p><p>“And her hearing seems to have gone,” Paul said, “and her sight maybe a bit. I don’t know.”</p><p>“Her sight is fine since she had her eye done,” Ali said. “Before that she wouldn’t recognize me some days.”</p><p>“It was the same with me,” Paul said. “One day she thought I was Tom Furlong.”</p><p>“I know,” Ali said. “She told me. She was mortified. She thought she had offended you.”</p><p>Paul asked her if there was another solution, if there was anyone who could look after Josie at home, but she replied that she did not think so.</p><p>“There’s work for everyone now, so no one wants to look after old people,” she said. “No one wants to do real work. I hope it lasts, that’s all I have to say.”</p><p>“But if you hear of anyone?”</p><p>“I’ll let you know. But maybe she’ll settle, Paul. That would be the best.”</p><p>When Ali had left, he located Josie’s post-office book among her papers and was shocked at the amount of money she had saved. He had thought at first that he would have to sell the house to pay for her care, but now he realized that she would have enough for some years, especially when her pension was added to the savings. As he looked for her pension book, her missal fell to the floor and out of it five or six memory cards, all bordered in black. He picked them up and looked at them: one for his grandmother and one for an uncle, and one for Carmel Fleming, an old friend of Josie’s with whom she had worked for many years at Whyte’s Insurance off the Market Square. And then among them he found one for his father, who had died when he was a baby. He looked at the date of his father’s death and his age and realized that his father would be in his eighties if he had lived. He would likely be too frail to help, Paul thought, or advise him on what to do about Josie. There was no point anymore in regretting that he had not lived.</p><p>Once he’d put his aunt’s missal back where it belonged, he decided that it was best not to keep looking through her private things. He took the post-office book and found his coat and turned off the lights in the house and locked the door before making his way to the hotel.</p><p>As he sat alone in the dining room having his supper, he smiled to himself at the thought of someone mixing him up with Tom Furlong, a local elderly member of the Knights of Columbanus. He knew how much Tom Furlong would disapprove of him. In all the years, Josie had never once referred to Paul’s sexuality; it was not something that could be mentioned. And he had never found out when she’d known for certain that he was gay. He had made a point of bringing friends to the house to visit; they were always male, and some of them were boyfriends or lovers, and thus they appeared in Aunt Josie’s front room a number of times over a year or two and then never again. Somehow, it seemed, she had understood, or maybe, he thought, someone had told her.</p><p>She had not mentioned, either, that at Mass on Christmas mornings he did not go with her to Communion but sat in his seat. He remembered her face as she walked<span data-page="page_4"></span> back down the aisle toward him, her expression a mixture of reverence and strain. He knew that others would have noticed his not going to the rail, and he supposed she might have minded that, too.</p><p>Only once, as the <em class="small">AIDS</em> crisis was daily in the news, had she made any oblique reference to his being gay. One day when he was leaving her house, having stayed over on a Saturday night, she turned to him gently as he stood up to go.</p><p>“Are you all right?” she asked, narrowing her eyes.</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“I was just worried about you, that’s all. I read the paper and I watch the television and I worry.”</p><p>“There’s no need to worry.”</p><p>“Are you sure, Paul?”</p><p>“I am,” he said. “But thanks for asking.”</p><p>He almost moved toward her to touch her arm or hold her hand for a moment, but instead he tried to smile to show that he loved and appreciated her tact. And then he left and drove back to Dublin.</p><p>The evening when she mistook him for Tom Furlong he had entered the house with his own key, as Tom must also have done regularly. With the light going, Josie was in the front room listening to the radio. It was the time when both her eyes and ears were failing her, and she had not even heard him enter. He did not want to turn on the light without asking her, in case he frightened her.</p><p>Slowly, however, his aunt became alert to his presence. But he had to shout his name several times, even though he was standing in front of her.</p><p>“Oh, sit down, Tom,” she said. “And it’s always lovely to see you.”</p><p>“No, it’s Paul. Paul.”</p><p>She said nothing for a while, and he wondered if he should turn on the light. But he waited and then sat down on the small sofa at the window.</p><p>“Tom,” she said warmly.</p><p>“No, Paul, Paul.”</p><p>“Oh, Paul,” she said sadly. “Paul got involved with a rotten crowd up in Dublin, Tom. A rotten crowd! I don’t know whether I was right or wrong when I decided I wouldn’t even pretend I knew about it. I made the decision all on my own not to get on to him about it. Oh, I don’t know.”</p><p>“Aunt Josie, it’s Paul. This is Paul.”</p><p>In the shadowy light, she stopped talking and peered toward him.</p><p>“What?” she asked.</p><p>He wondered if it would be possible to run out of the room and behave as if this scene had never taken place, make her feel that she might have dreamed a visitor, so that she could put it out of her mind, as he would, too.</p><p>“Aunt Josie, it’s Paul.”</p><p>“Oh, Paul,” she said, and then mumbled something. “Is it you, Paul?”</p><p>“Yes, it’s me. How are you?”</p><p>“Paul,” she said, and then stopped. “Paul, you won’t . . . I thought . . . Will you turn on the light?”</p><p>They talked for some time about the roads and all the traffic and the work being done and the length of time it took now to get through the town of Gorey. When he stood up to leave, she looked at him imploringly.</p><p>“You will come again, won’t you, Paul?”</p><p>“Of course I will, Josie, of course.”</p><p>He almost laughed to himself now at the memory of this scene, the one moment in all the years when her tact and sense of decorum had failed her.</p><p>When he came down to the nursing home the following Saturday, she was ready to leave once more, insisting that she knew where her coat was and that she had nothing of any value in her room, so they both could slip out—he could help her, and no one would be any the wiser. He sat patiently with her, explaining how fiercely cold it was outside, and asking her about the food and how she had slept, and smiling each time she pressed him to take her home and slowly explaining again that her house was freezing and that she was warm here.</p><p>“Did you not bring the car?”</p><p>“Aunt Josie, it’s the coldest day of the winter.”</p><p>“What day is it?”</p><p>“Saturday.”</p><p>“Will you go and get the car?”</p><p>He tried to change the subject and spoke about all the new houses being built on the edge of town and all the new people who had been taken on at his office, including two accountants from England. As he spoke, he became more determined to ask her to sign the forms that would give him power of attorney. Observing her, he realized that she must know where she was, and he believed that she must have some inkling that she was not going back to her own house. She seemed to alternate between an almost childish helplessness and a weary resignation.</p><p>He took the forms out of his jacket pocket.</p><p>“I need these forms signed for the bank,” he said. “I have a pen here.”</p><p>“What are they for?”</p><p>“They mean that I can lodge your pension for you, and get you money when you need it without you having to bother.”</p><p>She pretended that she did not hear. He knew that every word was being taken in by the others around them. He decided not to<span data-page="page_5"></span> repeat what he had said. He merely handed her the sheet of paper and held out a pen and pointed to the spot where she should sign.</p><p>“Just your name. I’ll put the date in.”</p><p>She looked at him, her expression cold and hard and wounded. He knew that if he flinched now, or changed the subject, or offered any further explanation or even apology, he would lose this chance.</p><p>“Here,” he said, and pointed to the line where she should sign.</p><p>“I never thought . . .” she began. She looked down and left silence.</p><p>Paul did not move. He held the paper steady and offered her the pen again. Slowly, Josie signed her name and pushed the sheet of paper away from her.</p><p>As the year went on, and spring gave way to summer, she began to complain less, agreeing that she liked the food at the nursing home, and that she found being put to bed at six each evening very restful; it was something she looked forward to, she said. When Christmas approached, he spoke to Noeleen, who said that many of the patients went to their families on Christmas Day, but she would be happy to look after Josie if Paul wished. He had friends in Dublin who usually had their Christmas dinner at four in the afternoon, so he could drive to the nursing home on Christmas morning and spend an hour or two with Josie and then return to Dublin.</p><p>When he came in at about eleven that morning, Josie was asleep and Noeleen was in the office. She was the one on duty all day, she said as she sat with him in the hallway, but she didn’t mind. She would have her Christmas dinner in the evening and be able to relax then.</p><p>“She talks about you all the time,” Noeleen said. “When you’re coming next, and what you’re doing. That’s her big subject.”</p><p>Paul smiled.</p><p>“She’s great most of the time,” he said. “And she’s put on weight.”</p><p>“I was thinking about you and her just this morning,” Noeleen said. “It was awful what happened, of course, and I knew your mother well. Josie was marvellous the way she took you in and reared you. I used to see the two of you walking back to her house together after her day’s work was over. And she was very proud of you.”</p><p>She looked at him and nodded cheerfully. He could think of nothing to say in reply.</p><p>“And, of course, your mother always got news of you and she must have been glad that you were being looked after. There were people in the town who kept in touch with her. She always asked about you, Paul. I heard that, now.”</p><p>Paul glanced over at his aunt. He hoped that she would wake up soon, so that this conversation could end.</p><p>“And she was wise to come home to Enniscorthy after all the years, to be among her own in the town,” Noeleen continued. “There’s a friend of mine is a neighbor of hers on the Ross Road, and she says that she’s in right form.”</p><p>Paul saw that Noeleen was watching him carefully. He did not know that his mother had come home to Enniscorthy and was living on the Ross Road. He wondered how long ago this had happened.</p><p>“There’s no love lost, of course, between her and Josie,” Noeleen said. “But that’s the way. That’s the way the good Lord made them, and they’re too old to change now. It would take a miracle.”</p><p>He had, he thought, no real memory of his mother, just a sense of being somewhere in a car with her and the memory of a smell of something that had made him sick. But he was not even sure about the memory. It was too vague. He had known, because he had heard someone say it, that she drank, but it wasn’t until he was a teen-ager that he understood what this meant. He knew that his mother had come to Josie’s house once when he was seven or eight and created a fuss in the street when Josie would not let her see him, because his friend Shane Colfer had told him the next day. He had been in the front room that night watching television and had not known what all the shouting was about. Josie had merely said that it was a woman who delivered kindling and she would be coming back on Saturday, thank God, with that delivery, which was long overdue. She had refused to pay the woman, she said, until she delivered the kindling.</p><p>His mother, he supposed, had gone back to England then. He had never asked about her. Her name had never been mentioned. Every day after school until he was twelve he would go and sit at Whyte’s Insurance, at his own special desk close to Josie’s, and do his homework, or make drawings, or read comic books. And then, at half past five, he would go home with her.</p><p>Josie made sure that he was happy and that he studied hard. As soon as it became obvious that he was good at maths and science, she learned everything she could about careers for him and what points he would need. She paid for grinds so that he would have honors<span data-page="page_6"></span> in maths and thus gain entrance to University College, Dublin, to study engineering.</p><p>He was always sure that his mother was alive, because he knew that someone, even Josie herself, would have to tell him if she died. She had sisters in the town whom he knew by sight, and a few times he had met cousins of his in one of the bars in the town, but he had not spoken much to them. Someone, he believed, would tell him if anything happened to his mother. But no one had told him that she had come home.</p><p>Over the next year he saw Josie whenever he could. Slowly, he became used to the atmosphere in the room where she sat during the day and he got to know some of those who sat with her, most of them silent, half asleep, but often friendly to him when he arrived, ready to offer a moment’s recognition or warmth, even if they seemed dazed or forlorn or too old to do much for themselves.</p><p>Halfway through the year, Josie changed and became brighter and less complaining. Not only did she put on weight but she seemed happier and smiled if one of the nurses came toward her. She also often seemed more forgetful and could ramble when she spoke. But she always recognized him and smiled at him and thanked him for visiting. Noeleen told him that the woman who had recently begun to sit beside Josie, Brigid, looked out for her, and they often talked to each other in whispers.</p><p>Paul noticed that sometimes the two women used the same rug to keep warm, and when tea came Brigid made sure that Josie did not spill hers and took the cup from her when she had finished drinking. Often, having driven for two hours, Paul felt guilty for staying only a short time, but it was hard to think of anything to say, and it was, he reassured himself, more important that he simply made the visit each time he promised he would. Despite the fact that her mind was slowly fading, Josie had a way of making him feel loved while he sat with her, and something close to proud that he had driven all that way.</p><p>She never mentioned the past, never spoke about her own childhood, or the years working in the insurance office, when she took care of him. All of this seemed to have been forgotten or erased, or maybe, he thought, was simply of no interest to her now that her world had narrowed.</p><p>He noticed new arrivals at the home more than he noticed who was missing, but slowly it became clear to him that the line of old ladies who had watched him when he first appeared in the large square room had gone and that some of them must have died or were now confined to their rooms. Josie seemed not to notice new arrivals or to miss those who were no longer there. She viewed the people in the room and the staff, Paul thought, as she viewed the television, with vague puzzlement but no real interest.</p><p>Once, when he had supper with an old boyfriend who asked about Josie and seemed to want to hear about the nursing home and the empty house in the town, Paul came close to confiding that his mother, as far as he knew, after an absence of more than thirty years, was now living in Enniscorthy as well. Instead, he decided to say nothing. He knew that his friend would argue that he should try to make contact with her. He did not want to hear that argument.</p><p>When it came close to Josie’s second Christmas in the nursing home, Noeleen took Paul into her office one Saturday after he had finished his visit.</p><p>“She is worried about Christmas,” she said.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“She’s been talking about it to Brigid. She brings it up all the time, according to Brigid. She thinks, well, she thinks . . .”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“That you spent last Christmas with your mother and left her out here.”</p><p>“But I didn’t.”</p><p>“I know, Paul.”</p><p>“I drove down to see her specially, and I went straight back to Dublin.”</p><p>“I know, Paul. I remember you saying, but I’m telling you, just in case.”</p><p>“What should I do?”</p><p>“Maybe try to reassure her. Say something, if you can.”</p><p>“But I told her last Christmas that I was going back to Dublin.”</p><p>“Well, that’s all you can do again.”</p><p>The following Saturday, he raised the subject, telling Josie that he was lucky that his friends Denis and David always had their Christmas dinner at four or five on Christmas Day, reminding her that she had met Denis a few years earlier and mentioning that his friends lived in Rathgar, not far from him. He had gone to their house last year, he said, and he was going to go again this year, once he had seen her. It would take him two hours, or even less, to get back to Dublin.</p><p>Josie did not respond.</p><p>Normally, Brigid greeted him warmly as he arrived and then pretended not to listen to any of the conversation he had with his aunt, but now she did not disguise her interest in what they were saying. She turned and nudged Josie,<span data-page="page_7"></span> nodding at Paul.</p><p>“That’s right, now,” she said. “Isn’t that what I said?”</p><p>Josie looked at the floor and smiled distantly, as though nothing being said were getting through to her fully.</p><p>“Did you hear him?” Brigid asked her.</p><p>Josie looked up at Paul, her expression absent-minded. “Have they managed to bypass Gorey yet?” she asked. “Or is it still as much a bottleneck as ever?”</p><p>“I hope the new road’ll be done soon,” he said. “But it’s bad at the moment.”</p><p>Brigid caught his eye.</p><p>“She heard you, all right. Don’t mind her, now.”</p><p>On Christmas Day, she seemed cheerful as she tried on the cashmere cardigan he had brought her; he told her again that he had driven down that morning and that he was going back soon to have his Christmas dinner with his friends in Dublin.</p><p>“I’d say the road was quiet coming down,” she said. “Years ago there’d be no traffic at all on Christmas Day, but I suppose that is changing, too, like everything else.”</p><p>She looked at him directly, as though she were checking now if he really had meant it when he said he was returning to Dublin. He held her gaze, trying to make it clear to her that he was not lying. She grew silent and seemed locked in some reflections of her own for a while until she noticed the buttons of the new cardigan, which she began to admire.</p><p>In the New Year, she started to weaken. Paul began to drive down one evening each week, as well as Saturday. He often found her asleep when he came on Saturdays, Brigid nudging her to wake up when she saw him coming; in the evenings when he visited, she was always in bed and usually did not wake. He moved a chair close to the bed and sat there for a while watching her. She seemed tiny in the bed; he noticed the veins on her hands almost breaking through the skin. Noeleen assured him that if there was an emergency she would call him immediately.</p><p>When Noeleen finally did call, in the late morning one Wednesday in the spring, he was not surprised.</p><p>“Should I come now?” he asked.</p><p>“You should, Paul.”</p><p>“How long does she have?”</p><p>“It could be a matter of hours,” she said. “She’s weakening. The pulse is slow.”</p><p>“Is she awake?”</p><p>“No, Paul, she’s asleep, and we have her very comfortable.”</p><p>“Does she know she is dying?”</p><p>“Ah, who can say?”</p><p>When he arrived at the nursing home, he did not go into the large room where Josie normally was but waited by the office for Noeleen to finish a telephone call.</p><p>“The doctor saw her earlier,” she said when she put the receiver down. “And he’ll come back if we need him. And I phoned the Manse and told them. There’s no priest there now, but they will phone back as soon as someone comes in. She woke earlier and took a drink of milk, but she’s asleep again now.”</p><p>They left him alone with her. A few times when she struggled for breath he thought to go into the corridor and find one of the nurses, but he presumed that they knew she was struggling for breath. A priest came and said the last rites.</p><p>Every time he walked down the corridor to go to the bathroom or get some air, Paul had the sense that he was being watched with a sort of grim silence by the old people who saw him. He was the messenger of death, he realized. He was the one waiting. They must have seen it before. None of them even acknowledged his presence.</p><p>Later, when it was dark, the doctor came and said that Josie could not last much longer. They left food for Paul in the dining room and put an armchair in Josie’s room, in case he wanted to sleep.</p><p>“You can never tell. She could last longer than any of us think,” Noeleen said as she prepared to retire for the night. “That’s God’s decision—it’s not ours.”</p><p>One of the women working all night was from Lithuania; the other was local. He was not sure if they were nurses or orderlies; he did not know their names. Slowly, however, as the night wore on, he realized, by the way the local woman came and took Josie’s pulse and by her skill at making his aunt more comfortable in bed, that she was a nurse. A few times when she came into the room he went out into the corridor with her afterward.</p><p>“I’ve seen it before,” she said. “She’s holding on. It’s impossible to know for how long. You learn things in this job. And one of them is that sometimes it’s the hardest thing to die, almost harder than to live. For some people, it’s the hardest thing of all.”</p><p>A while later, when Paul was alone having a cup of tea in the kitchen, she came and told him that he should return immediately to his aunt’s room. “She’s awake now. I didn’t think she would wake again.”</p><p>Josie, he saw, was lying on her back with her eyes open. There was a bedside lamp on, but he kept the door open as well so that light from the corridor came into the room.</p><p>“It’s Paul,” he said. “You<span data-page="page_8"></span> are having a great sleep.”</p><p>She mumbled something and then made as if to turn.</p><p>“I’m here now,” he said. “If you need me for anything. I’m sitting here. And I’ll get you anything you want.”</p><p>She seemed to grow more agitated, and her right hand began to shake. She was trying to say something, but he could not make out even a single word.</p><p>“Don’t make yourself tired,” he said. “You can rest now, and we’ll talk later.”</p><p>She turned her head and looked at him and tried again to speak.</p><p>“Her,” she said. “Her.”</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>He could not make out the next thing she tried to say.</p><p>“We can talk later, when you are up and dressed,” he said.</p><p>Josie’s hand began to shake again, and her breathing sounded like a set of sighs.</p><p>“Josie,” he said. “Can you hear me?”</p><p>She fixed her eyes on him.</p><p>“Can you hear me?”</p><p>She mumbled again, and he thought she might be saying that she could hear him, but he was not sure.</p><p>“I won’t see her. Do you understand?”</p><p>Her gaze was sharp now, almost accusing. She tried to move.</p><p>“No, don’t move. I’ll get the nurse in a minute. I just want you to know that I won’t see my mother. I didn’t visit her. I didn’t. I don’t even know where her house is. I haven’t seen her. And I won’t. I promise I won’t.”</p><p>She nodded, but he was not certain that it was a direct response to what he had said. He leaned in toward her and held her hand.</p><p>“I promise you now that I won’t see her. I don’t want to see her.”</p><p>He was still not sure that she had understood. When she closed her eyes, her face changed. For a moment it could have been a smile, but it was hard for him to tell. Her breathing grew shallow. He thought that she was going to die then and touched her arm tenderly for a moment and went to find the nurse. When he came back to the room, Josie’s face had changed once more, he thought, the expression softer, calmer. The nurse checked her pulse and looked at her watch.</p><p>“No, she has a while to go,” she said. “She’ll go in her own time. The doctor prescribed something for pain if she needs it, and I have the keys to the press where it’s kept. But she won’t need it now. She’s slipping away without any pain, that’s what she’s doing. But she’s not ready yet.”</p><p>As dawn broke and the morning light crept in through a chink in the curtains, new nurses came on duty, and the early routines and noises in the nursing home, which he had never witnessed before, began. When Noeleen appeared and said that it must have been a long night for him, he realized that the whole night had felt like an hour or two, nothing more. What was strange now, when he went back to the room and sat with Josie again, was how much she changed every few minutes. He wondered if it was a trick of the light, or maybe his eyes were tired. Her face, for a while in the morning shadows, seemed to him like the face of someone young. He had not known her when she was young. He remembered her always as a middle-aged woman with gray hair, someone content as long as nothing new or unusual was happening, someone always happier in her own house when the day was over and everything was in its place. He sat and watched her.</p><p>In the middle of the morning, they asked him to leave for a short time as they changed her position in the bed again.</p><p>“It won’t be long now,” the nurse whispered to him when she came to tell him that he could return to the room. He stayed with Josie for the next hour or so until the nurse appeared once more and took her pulse and then returned with Noeleen and another nurse and they said a decade of the Rosary as Josie faded into death.</p><p>The day was warm. Paul stood out in front of the nursing home and phoned work to say that he would not be there until the following Monday and then texted some friends in Dublin to say that his aunt had died. As he came back in, he found that Brigid had been taken by Noeleen down to the room to see Josie and say goodbye to her. He waited in the doorway as Brigid stood beside the bed. She smiled at him as she turned.</p><p>“Paul, I’d say you’ll miss her now,” Brigid whispered to him as she moved toward the door. “We’ll all miss her.”</p><p>“We will, all right,” he said.</p><p>Brigid sighed as she passed him.</p><p>“Well, that’s the way it is,” she said.</p><p>He stood in the doorway and watched her walking down the hallway back to her place in the large room, with Noeleen behind her to make sure that she did not fall. He turned then and closed the door and sat on his own with Josie. He thought for a moment of pulling the curtains back and letting the room fill with light so that he could look at her clearly for the last time, but he knew<span data-page="page_final"></span> that it was better to leave the room as it was. Her arm, when he touched it, was already getting cold.</p><p>He did not touch her again, but stayed there silently with her. He was tired, but he did not have even the smallest urge to sleep. He checked his mobile phone as a text came through from a friend. He thought that later he would go to Dublin and get a suit and some clean clothes and then come back and maybe stay at the hotel. In the meantime, he would wait until the undertaker arrived and then think about the death notice to be put in the newspaper and the arrangements for the funeral. There was, he thought, nothing else to be done.</p><p>As he sat there, he realized that he should go to Josie’s house, that staying at the hotel would do nothing for him. He could, he thought, leave the door ajar in her bedroom and her sitting room, or open a window, do something in the house to mark the fact that she had gone. He was surprised at how much that thought seemed to satisfy him, almost console him, and how quickly that thought led to another, one he had been keeping at bay.</p><p>Somewhere not far from here, he knew, his mother was living in the same day as he was, under the same sky, in the same watery light that came from the sea and the Slaney, and someone would surely tell her before evening that Josie, her sister-in-law, had died. The knowledge that he had promised not to see his mother merged in his thoughts with an image of her being told the news of Josie’s death. Her life and the one that he had lived apart from her filled his mind now, as though a space had been freed for them, the shadows cleared, by what had happened in the night and by Josie’s going. He found himself inhaling and releasing breath as a way of nourishing that space, and he breathed in hard for a second at the thought that nourishing it like this was maybe all he would ever be able to do with it. ♦</p>	Colm Toibin	April 13, 2009 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/04/13/the-color-of-shadows	Aunts	Christmas	Death	Dublin	Gays (Homosexuals)	Illness	Paul	Third	Death
The Edge of the Shoal	<p>He <span data-page="page_1"></span>swings the fish from the water, a wild stripe flicking and flashing into the boat, and grabs the line, twisting the hook out, holding the fish down in the footrests. It gasps, thrashes. Drums. Something rapid and primal, ceremonial, in the shallow of the open boat.</p><p>Flecks of blood and scales loosen, as if turning to rainbows in his hands, as he picks up the fish and breaks its neck, feels the minute rim of teeth inside its jaw on the pad of his forefinger, puts his thumb behind the head and snaps.</p><p>The jaw splits and the gills splay, like an opening flower.</p><p>He was sure he would catch fish. He left just a simple note: “Pick salad x.”</p><p>•</p><p>Briefly, he looks toward the inland cliffs, hoping the peregrine will be there, scanning as he patiently undoes the knot of traces, pares the feathers away from one another until they are free, and feeds them out. The boat is flecked. Glittered. A heat has come to the morning now, convincing and thick.</p><p>The kayak lilts. Weed floats. He thinks of her hair in water. The same darkened blond color.</p><p>It’s unusual to catch only one. Or it was just a straggler. The edge of the shoal. Something split it from the others.</p><p>He retrieves a carrier bag from the dry bag in back and stores the fish. Then he bails out the blood-rusted water from the boat.</p><p>Fish don’t have eyelids, remember. In this bright water, it’s likely they are deeper out.</p><p>He’s been hearing his father’s voice for the past few weeks now.</p><p>I’ve got this one, though. That’s enough. That’s lunch.</p><p>The bay lay just a little north. It was a short paddle from the flat beach inland of him, with the caravans on the low fields above, but it felt private.</p><p>His father long ago had told him that they were the only ones who knew about the bay, and that was a good thing between them to believe.</p><p>You’ll set the pan on a small fire and cook the mackerel as you used to do together, in the pats of butter you took from the roadside café. The butter will be liquid by now, and you will have to squeeze it from the wrapper like an ointment.</p><p>The bones in the cooling pan, fingers sticky with the toffee of burned butter.</p><p>He was not a talker. But he couldn’t imagine sitting in the bay and not talking to his father.</p><p>There is a strange gurgle and a razorbill appears, shudders off the water, flicks its head and preens. It looks at him, head cocked, turns as it paddles off a few yards. Then it dives again, and is gone.</p><p>•</p><p>He takes the plastic container from the front stow. It has warmed in the morning sun, and it seems wrong to him, the warmth. As if the ashes still had heat.</p><p>He unscrews the lid partially, caught by a sudden fear. That he will release some jinni, a ghost, the fatal germ. No. They’re sterile. He throws science at the fear.</p><p>He’s had to go through so many possessions, things that exploded with memories during the past few weeks; but it is the opposite with the ashes. He tries to hold away the fact they know nothing of what they are. Wants to remind the ashes of events, moments. To make them the physical thing of his father.</p><p>After the brief doubt, he relaxes again. Can feel the current arc him out, its subtle shift away from shore. A strong draw to the seemingly still water.</p><p>He has a sense, out here, of peace. Thinks, Why do we stop doing the things we enjoy and the things we know are good for us?</p><p>When he had fetched the kayak out from under the tarp, there were cobwebs, and earwigs in among the hatch straps.</p><p>He had not told her he was going. He’d expected it to be a weight he wanted to lift by himself.</p><p>There is a piping of oystercatchers, a clap of water as a fish jumps. He sees it for a moment, a silver nail. A thing deliberately, for a brief astounding moment, broken from its element.</p><p>•</p><p>Round the promontory, he fades the kayak, lets it drift, wiggling his ankles, working his feet loose with arrival. The water beneath him suddenly aglut, sentinel somehow, with jellyfish. He wonders if they are a sign, of some increasing heat perhaps. Then the noise of music hits him.</p><p>A child knee-high in the water, slapping at the waves. Another coming tentatively down the stones. A mother changing inside a towel.</p><p>The ashes sit perfectly in the drinks holder by his legs.</p><p>Laid out farther off, an adolescent girl. The sound of her radio travelling. A pile of bright things.</p><p>The child has found a whip of kelp and slaps at the waves.</p><p>It’s O.K., Dad, he says. We’ll come back later.</p><p>The sound of a Jet Ski, from the beach in front of the caravans. An urban, invasive sound.</p><p>We’ll come back when they’ve gone.</p><p>Out in the distance, a small cloud. A white flurry. A crowd of diving birds.</p><p>They won’t be here all day.</p><p>Then he paddles, the ashes by his legs, in a straight line out to sea.</p><p>•</p><p>It’s<span data-page="page_2"></span> as he’s holding his hands in the water, rubbing the blood and scales from them, that the hairs on his arms stand up and sway briefly, like seaweed in the current.</p><p>The birds that had indicated the fish had lifted suddenly. They are faint implications now, a hiatus disappearing against the light off the sea.</p><p>He is far enough offshore for the land to have paled in view.</p><p>The first lightning strikes somewhere out past the horizon. At first he thinks it just a sudden glint. The thunder happens moments later, and he feels sick in his gut.</p><p>He sees the rain as a thick dark band, moving in. Starts to paddle.</p><p>Then there is a wire of electric brightness . Three. Four. A rumble that seems to echo off the surface of the water.</p><p>He counts automatically, assesses the distance to land. Another throb of light. The coast still a thin wood-colored line.</p><p>The wind picks up, cold air moving in front of the storm. And then there is a basal roll. The sound of a great weight landing. A slow tearing in the sky.</p><p>One repeated word now. No, no, no.</p><p>When it hits him there is a bright white light.</p><p>•</p><p>He wakes floating on his back, caught on a cleat by the elastic toggle of his wetsuit shoe. Around him hailstones melt and dissipate. They are scattered on the kayak, roll off as it bobs on the slight waves. There is a hissing sound. The hailstones melting in the water.</p><p>He stares around, shell-shocked, trying to understand, a layer of ash on the surface of the water. He cannot move his arms. They are held out before him as if beseeching the sky.</p><p>Dead fish lie around him in the water.</p><p>He gets himself to the boat, the boat to him, drawing it with his leg, shaking until he frees the toggle, turns, kicks, twists, trying to lever with his useless arms. Somehow tips himself into the boat.</p><p>Live, he’s thinking. <em>Live</em>.</p><p>His fishing rod on fire upon the water as he slips off the world again, and passes out.</p><p>•</p><p>He moves because he coughs, a cough made of glass. Slowly lifts himself. One eye closed with salt. His face has been in the floor of the kayak and the salt is from the evaporated water. The sun had come out hard after the storm and evaporated the water, leaving the salt in a crust on his eye. When he opens the other, the light blinds him.</p><p>It hurts to breathe because his whole body hurts. As if he has suffered a great fall. His mouth, too, is crusted with salt. He does not know where he is. There is a pyroclast of fine dried ash across his skin.</p><p>He blinks and struggles to raise himself a little, the kayak shifting below him. The world slipping, rocking. When he grimaces, his lips split and bleed.</p><p>He looks down at his hands, feels the briefest twitch in his right arm, a wave and it spasms, smashes unfeelingly against the inside of the boat and goes dead again, falls against his side, a fish flicking after suffocating.</p><p>What happened? His consciousness a snapped cord his mind tries to pull back together.</p><p>His left hand stays inert, fractalled with purple; seems tattooed, in a pattern like ice on airplane glass.</p><p>•</p><p>The right arm, for a while, is wayward. Movable, but numb, clumsy.</p><p>He does not know how long he has been like this. Who he is.</p><p>He sees a rouge burn through the dry salt on the muscle of his forearm, sees the line of his shinbone startled and red. Feels his face. Like something felt through packaging, hears more than properly feels the paper of his dry cracked lips. He has the strange conviction that if he opens his stuck eye he will see what happened.</p><p>When he tries again, it’s as if that eye leaves his face and flutters by him. A butterfly.</p><p>It takes him a while to focus, to accept it. He’s forgotten there is other life. It puppets around him.</p><p>He cannot believe that a thing so small, so breakable, is out here. A thing that cannot put down on the water. How far must we be from land?</p><p>The butterfly settles on the bright lettering of the boat. He watches it open and close its wings in the sun. Opens and closes his working hand.</p><p>He reaches up and scrapes the salt from his closed lid, picks at the hard crystals. He wets his hand in the water, blinks with the sting as he bathes the eye.</p><p>When he refocusses, the butterfly is gone. For a split second, he believes again it was his eye, then he spots it, heading out over the water.</p><p>He feels a confusion, a kind of throb in his head. There is a complete horizon. A horizon everywhere around and no point of it seems closer than another. It brings claustrophobia. He does not know if he’s moving—if he’s travelling. He cannot tell in which direction if he is.</p><p>He feels only the rock, the sway, the dip and wallow of the boat.</p><p>•</p><p>For a moment, as he lifts from sleep, he thinks the warm sun on his neck is someone’s breath. Hears,<span data-page="page_3"></span> far off, the sound of a speedboat engine. There is land in sight, like a presence that has woken him.</p><p>He wakes with the understanding that the paddle is gone, and with that comes low panic.</p><p>His good arm has been in the water, and it is only as he raises it that he feels the little finger has been stripped.</p><p>It is torn and frayed to the first knuckle, skinned and swollen ragged with water, the pain searing and hot. The</p><p>nail is still there but tooth-marked where the little fish have bitten at it. As he touches the finger, his head spins, and when he passes out, again, it’s like another white light shoots through him.</p><p>•</p><p>The thump of the fin stirs him.</p><p>His head was resting on the gunwale as the dark fin struck..</p><p>He does not move. Cannot move. A few yards off, the fin rises again, a half-metre sail out of the water, a gun-gray body. His primal systems fire a wave of fear through him, the adrenaline trying to get through him like water poured on ice; and the fin folds, disappears.</p><p>He is frozen, urinates, cannot move his head.</p><p>When it bumps again it is as if the fin had grown tactile. It folds and flops, reaches into the boat, hallucinatory, cartoonish, like a sea lion’s flipper. And then the body of the fish, clownlike, lolls side-on in the water, a disk the size of a table.</p><p>This cannot be happening, he thinks. The sunfish and he eye to eye, its curious fin folding, flopping. An aberrant ripple to the water in the otherwise lambent calm. This is it, he thinks. This is it.</p><p>•</p><p><em>The sunfish stayed with him for hours. It could be said it steered him. It was almost the size of the kayak in length and bumped and rubbed the boat with a droll instinct, as a cow might a post.</em></p><p><em>The sunfish is not fishable, not edible, and no instinct has been driven into it to stay away from man. And perhaps it was the warmth of the boat it liked, with the plastic heated by the sun. Or perhaps it was something more.</em></p><p><em>But it stayed and bumped the boat for hours, and by doing so steered it; and it cannot be known whether it was deliberate, benevolent, that it did not steer the kayak farther out to sea.</em></p><p>•</p><p>He tries the screw of the locker in the center of the kayak, confused by his sureness that there is a first-aid kit, confused given the things he does not know. The locker will not shift. Focus, he thinks. Just accept the pain. Focus on the fact that the land is there.</p><p>He turns in his seat and reaches for the dry bag, husbanding the finger. Uses his teeth and his hand to open the bag and spill out the looser things—the sunblock, the T-shirt, the old cloth.</p><p>His ears are blistered and cracked. His skin parched and sore, stretched and gritty with salt. He rubs the sunblock in. A baffling thought of holidays. Works urgently, as if the next few moments were vital.</p><p>He rubs it on his dead hand and is frightened. That he cannot feel it. That it lies so inert. He feels a sort of horror at his body. How long has this taken to happen? How long have I been out here?</p><p>He looks again at his useless hand, the now fernlike pattern. It seems to follow his veins, mark tiny capillaries, a leaf skeleton disappearing under the tide line of ash into the sleeve of his top.</p><p>A wave of sick goes through him.</p><p>The idea of breath on his neck lies under everything. A suspicion that someone has been left behind.</p><p>•</p><p>He takes the T-shirt and wets it, wraps it on his head, the touch of it a heat at first against his burned skin. But then it cools, and there is a sort of weight lifted, as if the sun had stopped pressing.</p><p>He unzips the pocket of his buoyancy aid and fumbles out the phone, drops it into his lap as he pops open the waterproof pouch. He turns it upside down and tips the phone out, <em>thunk</em> on the boat, picks it up and tries to start it. Nothing.</p><p>Take it apart. Let it dry out.</p><p>He struggles with it until the back slips off. And there against the battery is a wren feather.</p><p>He traps it with his thumb. Holds it carefully. His memory like a dropped pack of cards.</p><p>Next door’s cat. Its strange possessive mewling, crouched over the wren, the bird like a knot of wood.</p><p>The bird vibrated briefly when he picked it up, a shudder of life. Then flew away.</p><p>He could not picture her, but a sense of her came back with that.</p><p>They had kept a feather each.</p><p>•</p><p>Shouts. Faintly. Loud shouts that reach him quieter than whispers. That seem to carry on the air like faintly visible things.</p><p>He notes movement, just a shifting of the air, the smallest breeze that bears the shouts; a sure current, the kayak drifts. Goes sideways past the shingle bay.</p><p>He is in a dream. He sees, there, a penguin crowd of people bathing in their clothes. In black-and-white suits.<span data-page="page_4"></span> They are playing in the water. Children in waistcoats. As if a wedding had run into the sea.</p><p>Where am I?</p><p>He lifts his arm. They are far off. Tiny on the shore. Tries to shout. Shouts like a puncture. Like a hiss of air.</p><p>Hears the draw and swash of the waves breaking in the bay, sees the children jumping the water. The sound of play. A bus parked on the road behind the beach.</p><p>Are they celebrating the end of the world? he thinks. I am dreaming. They are bathing in their clothes.</p><p>•</p><p>He watches the land fade, as if it were slowly sinking into the ocean.</p><p>He has bailed out the cockpit as best he can. The cloud of dark piss, the tide mark of salt that shows how the water has evaporated.</p><p>Scales of mackerel decal the inside, here and there is a zip of dried blood.</p><p>The ringing in his head is a hum now, a low choir, the flick of water on the boat constant, random, like the sound of work in the distance.</p><p>For a while, as he drifts, it is not the thirst, nor the sun, nor the open space around him that occupies him most. It is the need to stand up.</p><p>He tries the locker again. Pressures and turns with his thumb and finger, patiently, until the screw hatch jumps and, after a few hard-fought-for millimetres, rattles loose.</p><p>He fishes out the built-in pouch, squeezes the toggle and loosens the drawstring.</p><p>He unrolls the first-aid bag, the rip of Velcro a strange abrupt noise that seems to tear the fabric of sounds he has got used to. With the violence of the act, some of the dried ash falls flaked from his skin, as if drawing attention to itself.</p><p>He opens his mouth—winces at the chapped cracks of his lips—and bites down on a roll of gauze, uses an antiseptic towel on his finger. He even smells the sting, as he did as a child, Dettol on a grazed knee. He rocks it away, humming through the gauze, rocks until he can open his eyes on the pain.</p><p>He tears the dressing packet, puts the pad down on his thigh, and wraps it clumsily around his finger. The effort makes him reel. Then he pulls the papery tape with his teeth and gets an end around the dressing, jams the roll between his knees, makes a clumsy bandage. Fits on a plastic finger guard.</p><p>•</p><p>The water slapping the side of the boat picks up. It’s just the angles, he tells himself. It’s because I’m shifting my weight.</p><p>He leans over the front stow, unclips it, and draws out the large dry bag, sees the small pan in the hold, the rolled cloth that contains cutlery, a wooden spoon.</p><p>He feels odd little humpback lurches, an empty sickness without food. He has the bizarre sense that he could reach out, feel the same little kick in her stomach.</p><p>He pulls out a carrier bag. It is heavy with a bottle of water and a bottle of dark beer. He stares at the beer for a moment. He was going somewhere. He was going to drink a beer. Then, fumbling, urgent, he takes a drink of water, warm, hot almost, wets his mouth, lips, lets it spill wastefully over his chin. There is a shock at the immediacy of its effect, a voice screaming, Do not waste this; do not drink too much. He brings the bottle down with a sort of fear. Don’t drink too fast. Remembers watering a dry plant too quickly.</p><p>You have to save this, he thinks. Dry dirt will repel the thing it needs the most. Stares again for a moment at the beer.</p><p>He empties out the dry bag: Small gas stove. Espresso cup. Coffeemaker. Small plastic box of coffee. Tackle box with traces, hooks, weights, swivels, lures. Thick jumper. Reel of fishing line. Cagoule.</p><p>You went out. You went out too far fishing.</p><p>He keeps to hand the thick jumper. Tucks the cagoule in by the seat. Takes a brief inventory of the boat. He does not add: One man. One out of two arms. Four out of ten fingers. No paddle. No torch. One dead phone.</p><p>•</p><p>The sun drops beautifully.</p><p>He takes off the buoyancy aid and pulls on the jumper, useless arm first.</p><p>He puts the cagoule on, again the useless arm first, but cannot zip it up. Then he puts the buoyancy aid back on, and in the doing of it loses the T-shirt from his head. Watches, stoical, as it floats out on the water. There is a slight swell to the sea now, and the pan and the bottle in the forward hold roll and scrape inside, roll and scrape with the loll of the boat.</p><p>He scoots forward, opens the hold cover, horribly aware in that instant how small the kayak is, stuffs the pan and the bottle under the dry bag to jam them.</p><p>Of all the things to put up with, that would be too much: the persistent clunking. It is one of the few things he has any say in.</p><p>He has a horrible fear of falling out of the boat. Its frail platform. Of being afloat in the coming darkness.</p><p>He slips<span data-page="page_5"></span> the bungee from the back bay over himself like a seat belt, fastens one end of the paddle leash to the carry handle, the other round his ankle. It is nothing. But it is all that he can do.</p><p>•</p><p>With dark, the cold hits. It is immediate, comes with a sureness that it will get colder.</p><p>For a long time he fights the need to piss. Or what feels like a long time.</p><p>The swell picks up. The boat dips, sways as if two unseen hands are shifting it, panning for rare minerals. With his empty stomach, he feels a constant bowl of nausea.</p><p>He lifts off the bungee, kneels in the boat, and pisses off the side, a weak stream, a stench he hears pattering on the side of the gunwale. But where it hits the water there is a sudden light, a gorgeous phosphorescence.</p><p>When he sits back, he redoes the bungee round himself. That some of the stars on the horizon might be the lights of ships, of land, he can’t allow himself to think. Cannot allow himself to imagine the warmth, the food, the safety they would mean. It is better that they are stars.</p><p>How long? How long has it been? Is this my first night out? I would have been thirstier, wouldn’t I, if I’d been out longer?</p><p>He looks. A child awake in a dark bedroom. And, after a while, the stars seem to fade, at first very slowly. He does not know if it is an illusion, but they start to go out, like houselights across a night landscape.</p><p>He unwraps the emergency blanket, the silver foil of it speaking with reflected light.</p><p>The boat shifts up and down, a lullaby hush.</p><p>•</p><p>It is cold and it is pitch-black. Blacker when he opens his eyes, blacker than it was when they were closed—a stunning nothingness. He is hardly conscious. And he hears the child’s voice. Hears the clear troubling cry of a child.</p><p>This is not real, he thinks.</p><p>He feels that his heart is slow, his breathing flaccid.</p><p>Then comes the cry again.</p><p>The cold a complete tiredness. A calm. Like an acceptance of drowning.</p><p>I can go now, he thinks. I’ve done my best. He feels passive toward it. He is so cold that if there was any challenge to him he would let it happen, gently yield.</p><p>A spray of water covers him, pattering the plastic blanket, falls on him, warmer than his skin, and he opens his eyes, sees the green light, the perfect shape of dolphins playing round the boat.</p><p>Somewhere he feels his ticking heart, an engine trying to start. Was he nearly gone? Was he gone? The child’s cry, close by now, of the dolphin calf, and the mother breaks the water, a luminous green form leaving a figure of itself in the air, bright water dropping, a glow, crashing color landing, back, into the water.</p><p>The calf sounded so human. A baby in an upstairs room.</p><p>Stay alive, he thinks.</p><p>A bright tail, beautiful triangle.</p><p>You have to stay alive.</p><p>•</p><p>He wakes with a strange, specific clarity. Three solid simple things: her, the child, his physical ability. These, now, are his landmarks. The night has left him alive.</p><p>He sits up. His skin where it is bare has tightened. Where he touches there is a fine sand of dried salt.</p><p>He is uncertain of it, but he seems to sense something from his deadened arm.</p><p>He takes the fish from the carrier bag in the dry bag, and the fishing knife, and puts the fish down on the side of the boat, bringing a hollow gawp to his stomach.</p><p>He cuts behind the gills, turns the blade flat and draws it along, feeling it bump over the bones of the spine. The fillet peels off like a flap, the meat changed and cured in the heat.</p><p>He chews the fillet, the salt meat of it, then drinks some water, cooled again after the night.</p><p>It is not possible for him to believe that he will die, but he begins to fear that he will leave her alone.</p><p>This is going to be about rhythm. You cannot control anything else. Just your rhythm. You have half a small fish and four inches of water. If you grow impatient, it will go wrong.</p><p>The foily taste of the fish grows as he swallows the water, brings a sting to his mouth.</p><p>You have to conserve energy, and you have to be patient.</p><p>When he turns round to stow the dry bag, there is the land.</p><p>•</p><p>This is just rhythm, he says. You cannot race. You will move the boat only a little, but you must not be impatient.</p><p>He takes off the jumper and folds it into a pad. Then he kneels on it, puts on the buoyancy aid, and picks up the small frying pan as a paddle.</p><p>After a few strokes, he gets the boat around.</p><p>The pain of resting on his burning shins balances the pain of using his raw finger into a tough holdable thing.</p><p>That’s the land, he says. That’s everything. It was a low undulating line. It’s all about rhythm now.</p><p>•</p><p><em>All of his life he’s had a recurring dream: the<span data-page="page_6"></span> car leaves the road. It is never the impact that terrifies him, wakes him. His fear comes the moment he feels the car go.</em></p><p><em>His life does not pass before his eyes. There is even a point when he feels calm. But then he sees the faces of the people he loves. He sees their faces as they see him go.</em></p><p>•</p><p>The lick came into the waves late afternoon, and with it a wide swell to the water. The clouds now were an intentful dark strip on the horizon and they were incoming, and the breeze came before them, bringing patches over the water like a cat’s fur brushed the wrong way. He had continued to paddle on and off. Had thrown up after eating the second piece of fish, and that had affected him.</p><p>There was a thin bare moisture in the breeze, and every now and then he opened his mouth to it. Gradually he neared the land. The colors now distinguishable.</p><p>It was less easy to bear, having the land in view. He did not think, If I die you must find someone else; he could not think that. He felt a great responsibility.</p><p>He wanted to make sure she knew how to reset the pilot light on the boiler. Pictured a coffee cup, never moved, the little liquid left growing into a ghost of dust. The note: “Pick salad x.”</p><p>•</p><p>He thought at first it was a bag or a sack floating stiffly in the water. It was a fence banner. He turned the boat frantically, the handle of the pan rattling and worked loose now.</p><p>Seaweed and algae had grown on the banner, so it looked somehow furred, like a great dead animal on the surface of the water.</p><p>He pushed at the fur of algae and it slid easily, uncovered a bright picture of a family car.</p><p>There were metal eyelets in the corners and along the edge of the plasticked canvas, swollen and rusted in the water, and as he lifted it into the boat the banner caught and bridled in the breeze, the car rippling.</p><p>He scraped the bigger patches of algae from the banner with the back of his knife, then doubled the fishing line and fed it slackly through an eyelet and brought it back, tying it to the cleat where he clipped his seat. He did the same at the other corner.</p><p>Then he cut the toggle away from one end and took the drawstring from the hem of the cagoule to give himself a cord. With that he tied the other corners of the banner around the carry handles of the boat.</p><p>When he put his feet to the banner and lifted it aloft, the wind caught it with a snap.</p><p>He had an idea that the land was a magnet. If he could get close, it would draw him in.</p><p>•</p><p>The light dropped prematurely with the rain. At first thin, persistent gray drizzle.</p><p>He cut the top from the bottle and filled it where the rain ran down the sail of banner. His skin loosened. His eyes stung with salt that the rain washed into them. Every so often he bailed out the boat.</p><p>It was a light, saturating rain that pattered sharply on the cagoule he had put back on. Through it the land was visible and gray. Very sparsely, lights appeared.</p><p>The wind now brushed the crests from the waves and it filled the sail, blew a fine spray into the boat.</p><p>In the falling light it seemed that a shadow lifted up from the water and went past him. A low whirr of shearwaters. A ghost.</p><p>He thought then how, for the time he had been drifting, he had not seen other birds. He had not seen a plane.</p><p>What if this is it? What if there has been some quiet apocalypse? Some sheet of lethal radiation I survived. Some airborne plague.</p><p>He thought of the sunburn on his body, a momentary scald. Of the butterfly. A sect, drowning themselves in the water. The heat, liquid. Sluicing from the air.</p><p>Partly, there was relief in the idea. That he would not hurt them if they were already gone.</p><p>He shook the thought away.</p><p>The premature evening stars. How she wanted glow-in-the-dark dots stuck to the ceiling of the nursery.</p><p>•</p><p>When it was beyond doubt that the land was nearing, he wept quietly. The tears went into his mouth.</p><p>He lifted the banner with his feet a little and saw the growing details of the land. Then he rested, looked at the picture of the bright car. He could not get it out of his mind that she would be waiting on the beach; the bell of her stomach.</p><p>It was only then he recognized the danger, staring at the car: The car leaves the road. I have no way of steering. The land is now a wall.</p><p>The light was going. The storm was coming.</p><p>He felt it in the water first, like a muscle tensing. He would be better off farther out. If he could stay in the boat. If he could stay on it. Ride the storm.</p><p>He could hear now, distantly, the boom of water hitting cliffs. A low echo. The first sound of land.</p><p>Hold out. All you<span data-page="page_final"></span> need is daylight. You could go in on your own if you could see. Trust the buoyancy aid, trust the float. Just swim yourself in.</p><p>He turned, tried to look back out to sea. A dark bank moving in.</p><p>•</p><p>The squall came in like a landslide, with a physical force.</p><p>It cracked into the sail and drove the nose down and he struggled to level the boat, the cockpit filling and spewing.</p><p>As the sea picked up, he knew it was useless. The sign sang and hissed and seemed to bolt from him. You feel the strike, he knew now. You feel the strike coming.</p><p>He cut the cord, sending the banner out like a kite. A bird flapping. Then the line snapped and it ripped free, skimmed off over the water. A car out of control.</p><p>He held the carry handle, tried to jam his useless arm behind the seat.</p><p>You should have kept the banner. You should have kept it as a sea anchor. It might have kept you on to the waves.</p><p>His father’s voice was everywhere now, as if he had entered the sky.</p><p>There was no control. There was a randomness to the water.

Tried to lean the kayak into the waves. But the boat went round. The sea was up. An uprushing ground.</p><p>He thought of the land, the rock. He passed now beyond any sense of danger to a blank expectant place as he undid the paddle leash.</p><p>I do not want the boat to come with me. It would be like a missile.</p><p>If a bird the size of a wren can survive in the jaws of a cat.</p><p>Trust the float now.

The Hanging of the Schoolmarm	<p>The schoolmarm is playing poker in the town saloon. The stake is the saloon itself. As she is preparing to deal the cards, one of the men demands that she cut the fuckin’ deck, and she shoots him from her lap. “Sorry, but I simply cannot allow . . .”</p><p>The others tip their crumpled hats. “No, ma’am, you just go ahead and deal.”</p><p>The men of the town find the schoolmarm difficult but are awed by her refined and lofty character, and generally do what she tells them to do. The sheriff likes to say that she’s as pure as the spotless lily of the lake, though they have no lake, and there are no lilies in it. No damn lilies. The men cuss a lot—in fact, all the time—but never around the schoolmarm. Cussing doesn’t go together with the schoolmarm. It’s like salting your coffee, to put it politely.</p><p>After winning the saloon in the poker hand, the schoolmarm has the deceased removed and turns the card tables into school desks. The bar becomes an altar on Sundays, but there’s no preacher, so the schoolmarm provides temperance lectures from it, which the men are obliged to attend. In their minds, it’s still the old bar, the old saloon, so they carry along hip flasks and beef jerky to ease themselves through the unholy tedium, belching and snorting noisily.</p><p>The men are also obliged to take spelling and counting lessons on weekdays, using the signs on the saloon walls and the playing cards with numbers on them as their schoolbooks. The men learn that there are two “t”s in “spitting,” for example, and, when they forget or when they ignore the sign’s admonition, they get their heads rapped with a wooden ruler. The schoolmarm also raps their heads for uncouth laughter, bad grammar, cigar smoking in class, and tardiness. This head-rapping hurts, and finally it’s too much for them. They form a jury and condemn the schoolmarm to be hanged for her cruel city ways.</p><p>The schoolmarm insists that they discuss it first at their weekly meeting of the Deep Thinkers Club. The men associate deep thinking with deep drinking, so they welcome the opportunity. They’ve been missing the old saloon since its unlucky conversion. They gather at their desks, as the schoolmarm calls them, feeling like they’ve come home again.</p><p>The schoolmarm says that today, her last day, she wants them to think about justice and time, how little there is of either, and also about irony, which somehow relates to the same circumstances. The schoolmarm’s just showing off again, making their brains ache, unrepentant criminal that she is. There is talk of getting on with the hanging, but the men are comfortable where they sit, sucking their teeth contentedly, so no one really wants to get up and go do it.</p><p>The sheriff, famous for his quick wit, says that time is what he never has enough of, but at least he’s got more than the schoolmarm has. He laughs at his own little joke. The men think about it for a while, and then they laugh, too. The schoolmarm says that that’s what she means by irony, and the sheriff says he’s glad she explained it, because he couldn’t figure out what the dang ironing had to do with anything. Neither could the others. They still can’t, but they hoot and slap their desks just the same. The sheriff’s a pal of theirs.</p><p>On the subject of justice, the sheriff considers himself something of an expert. He disagrees with the schoolmarm about there being little of it and reminds her that he himself has dealt out a potful. In deference to the schoolmarm, he doesn’t say what sort of pot it was, but the men grunt knowingly. The sheriff then provides a discourse on law and order, which he says are birds of a feather. Blue, he says when someone asks, like a jay’s. One of the men says he thought it was more yellowish, like a chicken hawk’s. The sheriff says it depends on the color of the law that was broken, and at what time of day or night order got criminally disordered. On that subject, he explains to the Deep Thinkers that he prefers order to ordure, though they are more or less the same thing, only because “order” is easier to spell and don’t sound so foreign.</p><p>“Doesn’t sound so foreign,” the schoolmarm corrects.</p><p>“Yes’m, that’s what I said,” the sheriff says. “I ain’t completely stupid.” The men applaud the sheriff’s incomplete stupidity.</p><p>Then the schoolmarm delivers a lecture on eternity. It is too long. Many of the men’s heads are now on their desks. The schoolmarm’s lecture cannot be heard over the snoring, so she walks among them, twisting their ears. This wakes up only one at a time, and meanwhile another head falls. It’s a kind of dance of bouncing heads.</p><p>The sheriff does not want to get his ear twisted, so while the men are dropping off he takes the schoolmarm out to hang her. On the way to the gallows, the sheriff says that sometimes, in shootouts with desperadoes or when wrestling cattle rustlers at the edge of a cliff, he suffers trepidations, and he wonders if the schoolmarm is feeling anything like that now? She isn’t. Her unsentimental tough-mindedness<span data-page="page_final"></span> is legendary. Self-pity, she says, is the lowest state to which a person’s mind can fall. Other than lust and gluttony, of course. And indecency.</p><p>When the sheriff leads the schoolmarm up onto the gallows, he says, “I know you’re sad about losing your life, ma’am, but you gotta understand—out here, life don’t mean nothing. What only matters is rocks. Rocks and the un-effable, pardon the French.”</p><p>“Your French loses something in the translation,” the schoolmarm says, “but I suppose when you speak of the ineffable you are speaking of me.”</p><p>“Yes’m,” the sheriff says. “Sure am.”</p><p>“Rocks have more to say,” the schoolmarm says. “They express something profound about this place, this life, as I cannot. Language, even when grammatically correct, is simply inadequate. The situation is, in that sense, unspeakable. A landscape of rocks evokes a time before time, and the end-times as well, forcing us, while contemplating it, to live in all time at once, where words have nothing to attach themselves to.”</p><p>The sheriff nods, but he doesn’t know what the heck she’s talking about. He fits the noose around her neck.</p><p>“Only humans can experience time,” the schoolmarm continues portentously, “so time itself will not exist when life ends, as life inevitably must. Between the beginning of time and the end of it, there’s relatively only an eyeblink, and without life there’s no one to see that eyeblink or remember it. That is what rocks express. Though they are otherwise meaningless, they are, in this respect, the most meaningful thing we have, putting us in touch with oblivion. Which is the ineffablest thing of all.” The schoolmarm smiles, having invented a new expression.</p><p>“Excuse me, ma’am, ain’t all this just a way of putting off what’s got to happen?”</p><p>“Well, yes, sorry. I suppose it is. Give me a rock to hold.” ♦</p>	Robert Coover	November 28, 2016 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/11/28/the-hanging-of-the-schoolmarm	Books	Death	Hangings	Philosophy	Saloons	Sheriffs	Unnamed	Third	Death
The Republic of Empathy	<p>My wife wanted another baby. But I thought Philip was enough. A toddler is a lot. I couldn’t picture us going through the whole ordeal again. We’d just gotten our lives back. We needed time to snuggle with them, plan their futures.</p><p>But Peg really wanted another baby, said we owed Philip a brother or a sister. That seemed like a pretty huge debt. What do you do for the second child? Have a third?</p><p>“Peg,” I said. But I had no follow-up. Or was it follow-through?</p><p>Peg sat at the kitchen table, scribbling in the workbook that Arno, her German tutor, had given her. The handwriting didn’t look like hers, though I couldn’t remember the last time I’d seen her handwriting.</p><p>We were all apped up.</p><p>“This is a deal-breaker,” Peg said.</p><p>“The deal being our marriage?”</p><p>“Please don’t leave me,” she said.</p><p>“Who said I wanted to leave?”</p><p>“If you refuse to have another baby, that’s the same as leaving me.”</p><p>“This is emotional blackmail.”</p><p>“The emotional aspect is implicit. You could just say blackmail.”</p><p>“But why, Peg?”</p><p>“This morning I smelled the top of Philip’s head. That sweet baby scent is gone. Now it just smells like the top of any dumbshit’s head.”</p><p>I took Philip for a walk. He tired easily, but his gait was significant. He tended to clutch his hands behind his back, like the vexed ruler of something about to disintegrate.</p><p>“How about a brother or a sister?” I asked.</p><p>“How about I just pooped,” Philip said.</p><p>“Thanks for your input.”</p><p>Peg always said I shouldn’t model sarcasm for the boy, but who will? Everybody’s so earnest around children. Besides, I’ve always wanted to model. To strut down the runway under all that strobe and glitter, while the fashion aristocrats cheer on my sarcasm.</p><p>Later, I had to jet over to the office. The flip-flop prototypes were a total joke. Art had ignored my notes. Where were the porpoise pods, the sea grass? I hated Art. They needed some attitudinal realignment, or whatever the badasses say. Art and I were scheduled to meet in the meeting room and communicate about our communication problems.</p><p>Gregory walked up to my desk. He didn’t work for our company, but rented a room in the building, where he made paintings for plays and movies. Gregory painted to the specifications of the filmmakers and stage directors. He could paint a copy of a famous painting, or create a whole original series to represent the work of a character in a play or a movie. His oeuvre wasn’t known, but it had won fame and riches for fictional artists in several films.</p><p>Gregory always wore a festive shirt and a baseball cap with no logo. He said he wore these clothes because he believed they made him look like a thoughtful, retired, gay cop, which he was.</p><p>He’d come to see if I’d join him for a joint.</p><p>“Code Doob,” he said.</p><p>“Stat,” I said.</p><p>We went to the roof and smoked and stared at the large metal exhaust units mounted on nearby roofs.</p><p>“So, Peg . . .” I said.</p><p>“She wants to do a No. 2,” Gregory said. “I mean . . .”</p><p>“Oh, yeah, I told you already,” I said. “Guess I don’t have anything super-recent.”</p><p>“That’s O.K.,” Gregory said. “I got one. Guy just asked me to do a painting. Not a copy job but a painting in the style of. A very famous painter. Died young but did spectacular things. A great talent. All of my gifts would fit in his pinkie, and so forth. This guy said he would pay me the equivalent of what I thought a real, newly discovered, peak-performance painting by this painter would fetch. I said it would be many millions. He said he’d pay it.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Said he’s interested in exploring questions of authenticity, and he’s got the money to do it. Investment banker. But did some art theory in college. He’s not going to throw his money away on a yacht he’ll have no time to . . . yacht on. Here, at least, he’s shaking things up.”</p><p>“You’ll be so rich.”</p><p>“I told him to go to hell.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“I’m a copyist, and a hack visionary, but I’m not a criminal. Fuck the banker.”</p><p>“You’re a proud man,” I said.</p><p>“If that’s all it takes. . . . Hey, look.”</p><p>Across the way, on the roof of another building, two figures fought. They both wore dark coveralls and walkie-talkies clipped to their tool belts. They threw huge roundhouse punches, wrestled, choked each other, broke apart, and banged each other into the shiny exhausts and flues. You could hear the metal flutter.</p><p>“It’s either about money or women,” Gregory said.</p><p>“Or another man,” I said.</p><p>“Don’t get inclusive on my account,” Gregory said.</p><p>“Shouldn’t we call this in?”</p><p>“Good thinking, Citizen.”</p><p>We did call it in, but only after the next thing that happened. One of the guys grabbed the other guy’s shirt and spun him off the edge of the building. The falling guy fell. His head hit a steel fence post and made a moist, crunching sound. His body slid limp beside a dumpster. Vomit fired up my throat. Gregory called it in, used a language I knew vaguely from television.</p><p>We gave statements to the police. Afterward, we went<span data-page="page_2"></span> to a bar. Gregory warned me that I might have nightmares about the grisly scene we’d just witnessed, but if I had the wherewithal to utter, from within the dream, the word “Miranda” I might break out of the gruesomeness.</p><p>“Why Miranda?” I asked.</p><p>“Oh, that’s just what I use. You can use your own word.”</p><p>“Was she a friend of yours, Miranda?”</p><p>“She’s the friend of every cop who believes in a person’s right to remain silent.”</p><p>Peg was angry that I got home so late, but when I told her the story, leaving out the joint part, she seemed appeased. She didn’t care if I smoked marijuana. She smoked it, or, rather, took tinctures of THC on her tongue. But the idea that I might be out of the house doing anything enjoyable, and not generating revenue, enraged her. She had a right to be enraged. She was home with our son a good deal. It took a toll. You can cobble together a solid twelve minutes of unconquerable joy a day caring for a toddler. It’s just the other fourteen or fifteen hours that strip your nerves and immolate your spirit. Peg was a warrior, but she got testy when I told her that. She said she didn’t want to be a warrior. She wanted to be the smart, sexy, sociable woman she’d been before Philip.</p><p>I should have said, “You are, honey. You still are.”</p><p>Instead I said, “Better save up for a time machine.”</p><p>We hardly talked for a week. But I guess she’d forgiven me, as lately it had been all about another baby, and today my absence had been excused, even if it took a corpse to clear the air.</p><p>“You must be traumatized,” she said. “Oh, sweetie.”</p><p>She sat on the carpet with Philip, who chewed on a toy hammer.</p><p>“I’m O.K.,” I said.</p><p>I squatted down and stroked Philip’s face.</p><p>“It just reminds you of the fragility of everything,” I said. “Especially the fragility of brawling on the roof of a very tall building.”</p><p>“Let’s not ever do that to each other,” Peg said, her eyes filling with tears.</p><p>That night, I dreamed I had another son, a bigger one, and he punched me in the neck and I stumbled off the edge of a skyscraper. I fell through the air. I could also feel myself climbing out of the dream. Gregory floated near me, waved.</p><p>“Miranda!” I shouted. “Miranda!”</p><p>Peg shook me awake.</p><p>One hand cradled my head, the other hovered in a fist.</p><p>“How long have you been seeing this Miranda?” she asked.</p><p>“She’s a constitutional guarantee,” I said.</p><p>“She goes all night?”</p><p>“Forget it.”</p><p>“I can’t,” Peg said. “I’m pregnant.”</p><p>“We’re going to have a second kid? I thought we were going to keep discussing this.”</p><p>“A second kid? We have two kids already.”</p><p>“We do?”</p><p>Two boys walked into the room. One looked like Philip, but a few years older. The other, smaller, didn’t look like anybody I knew. They wore matching airplane pajamas.</p><p>“We can’t sleep,” the Philip-looking one said.</p><p>“Come on down,” Peg said, like a very tired game-show host.</p><p>The two boys slid into bed with us. The smaller one curled up beside me. He giggled and put his finger in my ear.</p><p>“Papa,” he said, dug hard with his fingernail.</p><p>“Ow!”</p><p>I jumped out of bed, clutching my ear.</p><p>“Toby,” Peg said. “Don’t hurt your father.” I ran out of the bedroom and into the living room. Things looked different in our dark apartment. I opened the front door and stepped into the hall. But cool, spongy grass had replaced the smudged carpet. In fact, there was no hall. I stood on a lawn on a moonlit lane. Night air filled my lungs and I stared up at the stars, then across to the houses, cream-colored houses with high porticos that lined the silent block. In one, nude, flabby figures moved behind a blindless bay window. The goddam Lockwoods masturbated each other on their sofa again, though how did I know their name or that these exhibitions were habitual? Did it matter? This couldn’t go on. What if Philip, or the other one, what’s-his-face, Toby, saw?</p><p>Dad picks me up on Knickerbocker near the monument in Cresskill. He has his new girlfriend in the car. I throw my bag into the back seat and slide in, shut the door.</p><p>“Welcome home,” Dad says. “This is my friend Lisa.”</p><p>“Totally sincere greetings,” I say, stick my hand over the seat back. Lisa grins. She looks younger than Dad’s last few. He goes through them quick—like he digs the idea of them, but when they get too close he sends them packing. Or else, and this is my buddy Ronko’s theory, he’s actually gay and can’t face it. But who ever heard of a gay homicide cop, and, besides, there’s no way you could be gay with this chick Lisa around. She has such nice, soft-looking hair, which is a tell-me-about-the-rabbits-George thing to say, but, hey, what can you do?</p><p>“Hi,” Lisa says. “It’s good to meet you. I’ve heard a lot of stories.”</p><p>“I’m sure they’re all true, but skewed by my dad’s peculiar vision of the world.”</p><p>“What’s his vision of the world?”</p><p>“He thinks raccoons are advance scouts for alien invaders.”</p><p>“It’s clear from their behavior that they<span data-page="page_3"></span> work for the Greys,” Dad says.</p><p>“Oh, Gregory,” she says, gives his head a playful shove.</p><p>“Watch out, I’m driving here!” Dad barks.</p><p>“Hey, Lisa,” I say. “What’s the lamest car in Bergen County?”</p><p>“A gold Firebird with four on the floor.”</p><p>She’s a local girl. She remembers that nasty joke from years ago, after a quartet of satanic metalheads turned their car into a carbon-monoxide Jacuzzi and went to meet their master.</p><p>She’s probably just a few years older than me.</p><p>“What are you two talking about?” Dad asks. He’s no local boy. He’s from Brooklyn. He moved us out here to Jersey when I was a kid. Apparently the schools were better. If that’s the case, the ones in Brooklyn must have been junior Treblinkas. Dad’s also old. Too old for this chick. But you have to hand it to him. I generally want to hand it to him, and then, while he’s absorbed in admiring whatever I’ve handed to him, kick away at his balls. That’s my basic strategy. Except he has no balls. Testicular cancer. Sounds like a bad rock band. I sound like the narrator of a mediocre young-adult novel from the eighties. Which is, in fact, what I am. Exactly whose colostomy bag must I tongue-wash to escape this edgy voice-driven narrative?</p><p>Back at the house, Lisa grills some steaks while Dad and I chop veggies for the salad.</p><p>“How’s your mom doing?” he asks.</p><p>“Mom?” I say.</p><p>“Your mom,” Dad says.</p><p>“Mom?” I say.</p><p>“Yes, Mom,” Dad says. His serrated blade bites into the cutting board. It’s like that commercial with the beer can, the tomato, the Japanese knife.</p><p>“Mom’s fine,” I say. “She’s rimming this experimental bassoonist from Santa Cruz.”</p><p>Dad throws the knife down, shoots me his photon-torpedo eyes.</p><p>Shields up.</p><p>“Don’t you talk about your mother that way,” he says.</p><p>“What?” I say. “I love the bassoon.”</p><p>“You know what I mean.”</p><p>“Sorry, dude,” I say.</p><p>Shields hold.</p><p>“Steaks are almost done,” Lisa calls from the deck. “Hope you like them severely wounded but not dead.”</p><p>“Fantastic!” Dad shouts back. He’s got this big smile on his face, like he’s happy or something. It’s a rare expression. Mostly you only see it on the weekends, when he’s working on his paintings. It’s how he relaxes from being around so much homicide. Now his eyes flick over to me, and I see that happiness drain away.</p><p>What Lisa just said, that’s how I feel about my relationship with Dad: severely wounded but not quite dead. O.K., maybe that’s sappy and jervis, but it’s how I feel, and, as the young protagonist, my job is to keep you abreast of my feelings. I’m brash, but you better believe I hurt inside. Like I said, I will do windows and colostomy bags. Just get me out of here, before I have to tell you in the next chapter how I think internal affairs is investigating my father, and what it’s like to be the son of a cop, and also what it’s like to cope with all the strangeness in the world, strangest of all being that I just know, with a certainty I’ve never experienced, that, before she is out of our lives forever, I will be in Lisa’s ass, though you probably won’t get to see it, or even hear me use the phrase “in Lisa’s ass,” because this book depends on school-library sales.</p><p>Leon banged open the metal door and staggered out onto the tar-covered roof. Fresko followed. They circled each other in sunlight, both men in a martial crouch. Voices screeched from the walkie-talkies on their hips. They wore shirts with name patches. Leon’s said Leon. Fresko’s said Pete. They worked maintenance in adjacent buildings. They were friends, and planned to make an action movie with Leon’s new digital camera over the weekend. During lunch, they rehearsed the dialogue for the fight scene.</p><p>“One of us is going to die today,” Fresko said.</p><p>“That would be you, dog,” Leon said. “It’s time to punch out, bro.”</p><p>“I’ll dock your goddam existence.”</p><p>“I’ll take it up with the grievance committee.”</p><p>“They’ll be grieving for you,” Fresko said.</p><p>“No time for arbitration, son. See this fist of mine? This is your severance package.”</p><p>Leon and Fresko charged each other. They didn’t know how to movie-fight. They only knew how to fight-fight. So, by tacit agreement, they fought-fought. It was the only way the scene would seem real. They ran at each other, collided, punched. They kicked and bit and spun in a clinch. And then Leon fell off the side of the building. Fresko thought it was a joke. It didn’t seem as if it was happening but it was happening. That’s how so many things happen.</p><p>You would never be able to ask Fresko about it. Not much later, he was doing five years for manslaughter. He hardly ever spoke, though one day he started to laugh and didn’t stop for hours. Somebody on the cell block asked him what was so goddam funny, but he couldn’t get the words out. What struck him at that moment was the realization that he and Leon had never actually figured out who was going to shoot the scene. They’d be too busy fighting, and there was nobody they could trust to do a<span data-page="page_4"></span> decent job. Maybe the camera could have followed the action if they had used some sort of professional robotic thingamajig, but how could they have afforded such equipment? They were janitors, for God’s sake. Oh, Leon. You moron. You were the only friend I ever had. We were going to be viral on the Internet. I didn’t spin you hard. You let punk-ass physics take you. Together forever, I thought. But you had to be a pumpkin. You had to smush your dumbshit head.</p><p>Even a monkey can make money. That’s what my mother always told me, but I think she undersold herself. She was a remarkable woman. That’s why I’m remarking on her now. She was also the only person who ever seemed like a person to me.</p><p>She started out like everybody else, if everybody else started out as a half-cultured girl from Connecticut who reckoned that all she had to do was sustain an aura of dazzling freshness and a husband would arrive to keep her in cozy bondage. She’d raise some love-starved children, and the husband would bring home the bacon and, with any luck, not spend many waking hours at home, eating it.</p><p>This is exactly how it went for a while, but then her particular bacon-procurer drove home from the city dead drunk and died. So she went out and made her own, well, let’s just call it money, again. My mother became a successful Realtor, and invested in many soon-to-be-lucrative areas early. But her stock-market strategies aren’t the point. The fact that here was a woman, a nearly destitute widow, in a very sexist America, who ventured out into a man’s world and amazed is the point. I grew up rich, and she sent me to top-shelf schools. I took art history, and some art-theory classes that puzzled and intrigued me. There was the funny lingo. Everybody was always “interrogating hegemonic discourse” and so forth. I hung out with kids who were really fascinated by this crap. They were also really into cocaine and sex. I was bound for an M.B.A. after college, but I liked to sit around the table late at night, drunk and high, smoking cigarettes and arguing points that I had barely grasped in seminar. I usually brought the cocaine, and I was often rewarded with sex.</p><p>I forgot most of this for many years. I went into banking and made mad cake. I managed a hedge fund and made madder cake, or, rather, money. I became one of those guys you never see and have never heard of but who are the sick-ass kings of certain sectors of the market, employing instruments you could never in your math-illiterate lifetime comprehend. I know this tone, my tone, is insufferable. But that’s the thing that nobody understands. If you want to make money, you have to be smart and an asshole and also work harder than anyone else. Most people can’t manage all three. But I could, and I prospered, as my mother had.</p><p>Then my mother died. It sucked in the ways you’d be familiar with if your mother (assuming she was a decent mother) died. But then a cruel thought came to me, like some microscopic killer drone sent by the National Security Agency into my mind via my ear canal. I could picture it swooping down and firing a withering notion into that seething cauldron of ideation commonly known as the human mind / brain: What if I’m not really grieving for my mother, the thought detonation went, but, without my conscious knowledge, faking it? This would not be for appearances’ sake, obviously, but to maintain sanity. What if I had managed to trick myself into feeling / experiencing the normal emotions of a normal person stricken with grief to avoid the realization that I was a frozen freak, unmoved by the death of my mother?</p><p>Hell, I know I’m not the first person to question the authenticity of his emotions, but I’m quite possibly the wealthiest, and the question lingered, first as a mild irritant, later as a wet, burning sensation. I couldn’t shake it.</p><p>I checked my finances and realized I had enough money to live on until the end of time.</p><p>I quit my job, which wasn’t really a job, but more a jobstyle, and set off on a quest to interrogate the discourse of authenticity. I called up an old professor of mine. He’d become quite famous as a television pundit but retained a shred of academic credibility and nearly all his hair. He murmured something as I explained my project.</p><p>“Excuse me?” I said.</p><p>“We don’t say ‘interrogate’ anymore,” the professor said. “You know, Guantánamo. For the same reason, we don’t suggest that anybody has ‘tortured’ a theme or that a term paper will be satisfactory once the student ‘waterboards’ the conclusion a little. Language betrays us, uses us. Language goes through us the way a young onanist goes through a dust-sheathed pocket pack of Kleenex found on his family’s basement crafts shelf.”</p><p>“Sure,” I said. “But what about my project?”</p><p>“It seems retrograde and silly,” the professor said, “but for five hundred large I will endorse certain strains of your proposal, without getting behind the thing completely.”</p><p>“Done and done,” I said.</p><p>“What does the second done refer to?”</p><p>“The cementing of my distaste for you.”</p><p>Not long<span data-page="page_5"></span> after this, at a Hot &amp; Crusty on upper Broadway, I met the painter Gregory. He was scraping all the seeds and salt and burned onion shavings off an everything bagel with a plastic fork. In other words, he was transforming an everything bagel into a nothing bagel. Typical of an artist, to make conceptual work of his breakfast. I told him I admired his concept. He told me to fuck off, that they had given him the bagel by mistake, and he was afraid to ask for another, because even though he was an ex-cop he was frightened of the old woman behind the counter. I winked in complicity with his ruse and he told me to fuck off again. Then I went to the counter and bought him a plain bagel. He relented. He told me everything about his life, his police career, his son, who somewhere along the way had stopped being his son and become the shadow self of an edgy young-adult-novel narrator from the eighties, his cancer, and how he, Gregory, had come out of the closet at the “ripe, but not old” age of forty-seven, his first encounter having been with an angular, large-penised boy named Ronko. Finally, Gregory told me about his work as a painter for fictional painters. I felt like I’d struck gold vis-à-vis my quest not to interrogate but simply to explore questions of authenticity.</p><p>The rest is not quite accepted history.

The Visitor	<p>The <span data-page="page_1"></span>new boy was three-quarters gone. Both legs below the knee and the left arm at the shoulder. Candy spent her lunch hour lying on the lawn outside the V.A. hospital, sending nicotine clouds into the cloudless sky, wondering whether it would be better to have one leg and no arms—or, if you were lucky enough to have an arm and a leg left, whether it would be better to have them on opposite sides, for balance. In her six months as a nurse’s aide, she had become thoughtful about the subtle hierarchy of human disintegration. Blind versus deaf—that was a no-brainer, no brain being perhaps the one wound in her personal calculus that could not be traded in for something worse.</p><p>It was sad. Of course it was sad. But she didn’t feel sad. Sad was what people said they were in the face of tragedies as serious as suicide bombings or as minor as a lost earring. It was a word that people used to tidy up and put the problem out of sight.</p><p>The grass was making needle-like pricks through the thin material of her maroon scrubs, and she sat up, smoothing her matching V-neck over her chest and belly, feeling the familiar stab of self-consciousness as her hand rode over the unfashionable lumps. In photographs, Candy’s mother, Sylvie, at twentytwo—Candy’s age now—was as skinny as dripping water, but that could have been a result of the drugs. Candy had her grandmother’s build, and she knew that with age her shape would settle into the short, hale block that was Marjorie, less body than space-saver.</p><p>Candy glanced at her watch. She still had ten minutes until the end of her break.</p><p>She wasn’t sure when she had last felt sad. She knew that she must have been sad when she was eleven and her mother had gone into the hospital for the last time. But she couldn’t actually recall the feeling. She did remember being happy afterward, sitting at her grandmother’s kitchen table picking walnuts out of their shells with the tines of a fork, while Marjorie made phone calls to let people know that Sylvie had landed on her final and terminal addiction: death. She listened to Marjorie say, “My baby <em>diiihd</em>,” the last vestiges of her Texas accent breathing so much air into the word that Candy could almost see it flying up toward the ceiling of the kitchen like a helium balloon. Sylvie’s presence in Candy’s life had been birdlike. She had swooped into Marjorie’s apartment from time to time to drop a Big Mac into Candy’s waiting mouth, but the enthusiasm that she’d carried with her usually dissipated quickly, smothered as much by Marjorie’s insistence on behaving as if nothing were out of the ordinary as by Candy’s abject need.</p><p>Candy recalled feeling another sort of happiness, too, when she had crawled over the railing of the hospital bed in order to lie next to her mother one last time. Marjorie had forced Candy to wear a new party dress she’d sewn the day before. The frock, made with leftover material from the flower-girl dress that Marjorie had been working on, was an embarrassing pink affair that grabbed at the tender buds of Candy’s new breasts with tight smocking. What was the point, Candy had whined, as Marjorie finished off the hem, breathing heavily through her nose, her mouth a cactus of pins. But in the hospital, lying beside her mother, Candy had understood why she was so dressed up: she was there to act out the role of daughter in the hope that Sylvie would wake and finally take up her own part in the charade of parenting that Marjorie had insisted on whenever Sylvie showed up at the apartment—as if Sylvie had come back not for food or a shower or money but to French-braid Candy’s hair or to explain menstruation to her. The metal guardrails on the bed had felt cold against Candy’s thighs. The sensation was shocking in a pleasurable way that she couldn’t name then, but it wasn’t long before she discovered that the faucet in her grandmother’s bathtub could be angled to hit her between the legs just so.</p><p>When Candy first started working at the V.A., the other aides had said that it would take her a long time to become “used to it.” They’d told her to look away from the wounds, to focus on the soldiers’ faces as a way to protect the boys from embarrassment and herself from disgust. But she was not disgusted, even when she had to rewrap stumps or sponge gashes that were sewn up like shark bites. She found these molestations frankly interesting, the body deconstructed so that you could see what it really was: just bits and pieces, really, no different from the snatches of fabric that Marjorie wrestled into dresses for Mr. Victor of Paris, the tailor in Burbank who had employed her for thirty-seven years. The nurses praised Candy’s bravery, but when she passed by a group of aides taking their break in the cafeteria one afternoon she knew from their covert glances that they found her strange. She once overheard a girl say that she had no heart.</p><p>Well, no heart was better than no brain, Candy thought, as she sucked on the last of her cigarette and stubbed it out in the<span data-page="page_2"></span> grass, dismissing the notion that she might cause a brushfire in this hottest of seasons. She knew that hers was not a singular life, that she would not be the cause of anything monumental. Recently, the thermometer had topped out at a hundred and nine in the valley. The power had failed in her grandmother’s apartment complex, where Candy had lived all her life. Marjorie, excited by the idea of a disaster that she might have some control over, had instructed Candy to gather her important papers, as if she expected the apartment to burst into spontaneous flames. Candy scanned the top of her dresser, where her community-college diploma sat in its Plexiglas frame, alongside assorted gift-with-purchase tubes of lipstick and miniature eyeshadow compacts. In a gesture that even at the time she regarded as TV-movie maudlin, she had put her mother’s Communion cross around her neck and lain down on her bed. When she was woken by the sudden snap of lights turning on and the sound of her window fan whirring to life, she took off the necklace and placed it back in her dresser drawer. She showered and went to bed naked, letting the fan blow its slow, oscillating wind across her body.</p><p>The new boy’s name was Gregorio Villalobos. Juana, the admitting nurse, told Candy that <em>lobo</em> meant “wolf” in Spanish. Down the hall lay a Putter and a Shooter, boys who clung to their jaunty monikers as though they were one day going to walk out of the hospital and back onto the golf course or the basketball court where they had earned those nicknames. Candy wondered if the new boy had been called El Lobo in the service. She could ask him, but he wouldn’t answer her. He had not yet spoken. He watched her as she moved around the room, his eyes tracking her as if she were a fly and he was waiting for the right moment to bring down his swatter. Most of the boys looked at her when she brought them food or checked on I.V. bags, but their gazes were like those of old dogs: hope combined with the absence of hope. The nurses chattered at the boys as they went about their work, talking about the weather or whatever sports trivia they had picked up from their husbands. In general, the boys went along with this, and Candy often felt as if she were watching a play in which all the actors had agreed to pretend that someone onstage had not just taken a huge shit. Candy knew that the nurses were scared of silence, and perhaps the boys were, too. The truth hid in silence.</p><p>Before she left the room, she looked at El Lobo’s chart. It wasn’t her business to read charts, simply to mark down what he did and didn’t eat, did and didn’t expel. She’d received minimal training, most of which had to do with things that anyone who’d ever cleaned a house would know, and she couldn’t understand much of what was written on the chart. But she did understand the phrase “elective muteness.” She stared at El Lobo, feeling words crawling up inside her, pushing to get past her closed lips—that pathetic human need to communicate when there was nothing to say. She had been this way when her mother was alive. On the occasions when Sylvie was home, Candy had told her anything she could think of to tell: what had happened at school that day, what clothing the popular girls were wearing, how pretty she thought Sylvie looked, with her dark hair parted down the center and hanging on either side of her narrow face like a magician’s cape. She’d talk and talk, and the more she suspected that her mother didn’t care what she was saying, the more she’d fill the apartment with her desperate noise.</p><p>She replaced the chart on the hook at the foot of the bed and glanced at El Lobo once more before leaving the room. She could hold her silence longer than he could. He had no idea who he was dealing with.</p><p>That night, she woke to the sound of her grandmother yelling at the ghost.</p><p>“Get outta here <em>riii-ght</em> this minute!” Marjorie said, her accent always thicker when she was torn from her dreams, as if her unconscious resided in Beaumont, Texas, while the rest of her kept pace in L.A. Water splashed noisily against the porcelain sink in the bathroom between Candy’s and Marjorie’s bedrooms.</p><p>Candy lay in her bed, which had been her mother’s childhood bed, the headboard still bearing the Day-Glo flower stickers her mother had affixed to it. Candy tried to imagine Sylvie as a naïve girl who liked stickers, but it was impossible. What she remembered most about her mother was the patchouli scent of her skin, underneath which hid a more elusive, dirty smell, an odor that Candy yearned to excavate whenever Sylvie was near. But Sylvie did not often let her daughter get that close. Even during the times when she was living at home, when she swore to Marjorie that she was clean, and Marjorie decided, all pinny-eyed, fidgety evidence to the contrary, to believe her, Sylvie kept herself apart. She’d take over her old room, leaving Candy to the fold-out sofa in the living room, and Candy would spend the early-evening<span data-page="page_3"></span> hours inventing reasons to walk past the bedroom door, hoping that it might open, that she might be invited in.</p><p>Candy listened as her grandmother hurried into the bathroom to turn off the faucet.</p><p>“Turn that water on again and I’ll murder you!” Marjorie said, on her way past Candy’s room to the kitchen. “It’s quarter past three, for Lord’s sake.”</p><p>Candy got out of bed and made her way to the kitchen, too. Marjorie wore her quilted bathrobe, and her bulb of short graying hair was lopsided from lying in bed. She had already set the kettle on the stove. “Ah, she woke you up, too,” she said, shaking her head ruefully.</p><p>“<em>You</em> woke me up,” Candy said, sitting down at the table. “You probably woke the whole building.”</p><p>“That ghost is running up my water bill. It has to stop.”</p><p>“Maybe he’s thirsty,” Candy said.</p><p>“He’s a she, and ghosts don’t drink, darlin’. They have no bodies. She just turns on the tap to get my goat. <em>And in a dry season</em>, <em>no less!</em> ” she yelled, shaking her fist in the air, as if the ghost were hiding just outside the kitchen door. The wattle beneath Marjorie’s upper arm wavered and Candy remembered how she had played with that loose skin as a child. Something about her grandmother’s excesses of flesh was comforting. On bad nights, when Candy felt an aching maw open up in her chest, she’d slip into Marjorie’s bed. Her nameless dread was always calmed when her cheeks grazed the loose bags of her grandmother’s nylon-swaddled breasts.</p><p>Marjorie set down two mugs on the kitchen table, then brought over the kettle and poured. “I’ll tell you what, though. I’m tired of waking up in the middle of the night. I’m too old for it.”</p><p>“Maybe we should have an exorcism.”</p><p>“You don’t believe in that foolishness, I hope. Oh, you’re just teasing me, you bad girl,” she added, when she saw Candy’s grin.</p><p>“We got a new boy in,” Candy said, changing the subject. “He’s a mess.”</p><p>“Ahh,” Marjorie said, sympathetically, replacing the kettle on the stove.</p><p>“No one’s come to visit him. It’s been two days.”</p><p>“Maybe he has no one.”</p><p>“They’re usually there at admitting with their balloons and those smiles. You can see them counting the minutes until they can get the hell out of there.”</p><p>“You’re harsh, baby girl. It’s not easy to see something destroyed.”</p><p>Candy looked at her grandmother’s hands. Arthritis was beginning to shape them, like some devious sculptor, and it wouldn’t be long before she could no longer work a sewing machine or hold needle and thread. What then? Could they survive on Marjorie’s Social Security and Candy’s pathetic salary? Candy remembered Marjorie’s younger, stronger hands cupping Sylvie’s cheeks as she tried to wake her, tried to get her to stand up from the living-room floor where she had collapsed sometime during the night. “Time to get your girl to school!” she’d say, her determination fending off the futility of her effort. Candy remembered, too, her grandmother’s calloused grip around her own small hand when they made those hurried journeys to school together, more often than not leaving Sylvie behind, curled up on herself like a pill bug.</p><p>El Lobo was, of course, where Candy had left him the afternoon before, lying in his bed, gazing up at the ceiling. She raised the mattress so that he was facing forward, placed his breakfast tray on the rolling table, and swung it across the bed. She removed the lid of the oatmeal and the canned pears and peeled off the layer of plastic wrap covering the glass of water. The meal’s monochromatic paleness was disheartening, but Candy dug into the oatmeal with a spoon and lifted it to El Lobo’s mouth. He ate dutifully, but without affect, as if some inner computer chip were responsible for the opening and closing of his lips and the gentle modulations of his throat. He made no eye contact with her. Candy took the opportunity to go vacant as well, a state she had perfected as a child. She’d found that she could continue to do what was required of her—clean her room or go through the motions of paying attention in class, even read out loud if the teacher requested it, while her mind wandered. In that peaceful oblivion, she felt swaddled in cotton, divorced from the feelings that usually plagued her, unworried about what she looked like in her homemade clothing or what others thought of the girl with a grandmother for a mother. The sounds of the other children came at her muffled, harmless. Time passed. She disappeared.</p><p>She looked over to find that El Lobo’s chin was covered with syrup where she had missed his mouth. It irked her that he had let this happen without making any sound to alert her to the problem. She wiped him clean, becoming even more irritated when he didn’t seem to register this help, either. She took a last, hard swipe at his mouth. He finally looked at her, and his glance was sharp and full of menace. The ease with which his expression resolved into hatred made it clear that anger was his default position. The nurses talked about the “sweet” boys or the “darling” boys, as if the upside of the physical damage were that it turned<span data-page="page_4"></span> a soldier into a feckless three-year-old, thus ridding the world of one more potentially dangerous man. But Candy knew that this boy was neither sweet nor darling, and probably never had been. She imagined him as a bored high-school shark, moving slow and silent through the halls, heavy with his own power and cravings. She had known boys like this, had fucked boys like this.</p><p>She marked on his chart the amount of solids and liquids he had consumed, rolled the tray away from his bed, and carried the half-eaten breakfast into the hallway. She spent the next seven hours of her shift changing sheets and emptying bedpans, delivering food baskets that would be at the nurses’ station by day’s end, as most of the patients had restricted diets or were fed through tubes. She wheeled one boy to X-ray through the maze of hallways and elevators. Every time the gurney lurched over a transom, the boy winced in pain. The first few times, she apologized, but then she stopped, because she knew that her regret, like a basket of muffins, was, in some way, an affront.</p><p>Later that day, after she had finished her shift, she returned to El Lobo’s room. He was asleep, so she sat in the orange plastic chair in the corner and watched him. As he lay in his bed, covered in blankets, his wounds were invisible; his head, his nutmeg skin, his thick, dark eyebrows and generous, scowling mouth were untouched. A stranger might have thought him one of the lucky ones in this war. Only after his so-called recovery, when he would have to have special clothing made, when he would be assaulted by all the daily acts he could no longer accomplish, would he truly feel the extent of his wounds. She knew about collateral damage, knew that the injuries people saw were never the gravest. After Sylvie died, the school counsellor had brought Candy into her office and handed her a pamphlet called “Teen-Agers and Grief: A Handbook.” She’d told Candy that, although it was against state regulations, she was going to give Candy a hug. She’d had no idea about the hard lump of rage that sat lodged in Candy’s throat like a nut swallowed whole.</p><p>After fifteen minutes, El Lobo’s eyes opened. For a second, his expression was soft and pliable, like that of a child waking from a nap, but then his mind took over and something calcified in his features, his muscles hardening against the invasion of thought. His gaze fell on her. She didn’t move, but continued to stare at him. He stared back, his upper lip trembling in what she thought was the beginning of an insult. She felt a tingling in her gut, and her nerves were on alert, as if he had actually grazed her skin with that leftover hand. The second-shift nurse’s voice cut through the silence as she entered and exited rooms along the hallway, announcing pain-relieving meds in a voice as bright and cutting as a laser. Candy stood and walked over to the bed. She reached under the cover and pinched El Lobo hard on his arm. She heard his sharp intake of breath, and slipped out of the room before she was discovered.</p><p>At 3 <em class="small">A.M</em>., Marjorie tore into the bathroom.</p><p>“You leave me alone!” she yelled. “I’ve done enough for you already.”</p><p>Candy decided to stay in bed. A few times, over the five years since the ghost had announced itself, Candy had tried to stay up all night. She thought that if she could just once catch Marjorie turning on the faucet—perhaps it was sleepwalking, or some early sign of senility—she would stop, and Candy could get some rest. But on those nights either the ghost had not appeared or Candy had dropped off to sleep, despite the cans of Coke littering her bedside table.</p><p>She heard the sound of the sewing machine clattering into action. The machine slowed and quickened, and Candy imagined her grandmother’s bare foot playing the floor pedal. She knew that she had little chance of getting back to sleep. It was too hot to put on her terry-cloth robe, so, wearing only her T-shirt and underwear, she went into the living room, where Marjorie bent to her task.</p><p>“What are you making?” Candy said.</p><p>“Right about now, nothing,” Marjorie said. She lifted the foot of the sewing machine and pulled the material out, snipped the threads with a pair of scissors, and set to ripping out what she had done. “Victor gives me two weeks to do a bride and four bridesmaids. Two weeks! The man is losing whatever brains he had to begin with.”</p><p>Candy watched her grandmother’s hands shake as she pulled out the tiny stitches with her seam ripper. Marjorie was no longer as adept as she had been when she was younger and able to unroll a bolt of cloth and see every seam and dart, every buttonhole and facing, when she could tell, even before putting one pin into the cloth, how it would all fall together. A dress form stood beside the sewing machine, draped in the raw ivory silk that Marjorie was working with. Headless and armless, the figure tilted slightly on its stand, as if leaning over to tell a secret.</p><p>“Expensive,” Candy said, fingering the cloth.</p><p>“Hands off!” Marjorie ordered,<span data-page="page_5"></span> batting Candy’s hands away lightly, as she had done when Candy was young. “Spend all this money on silk and then give me next to no time to do my job. This missy will be lucky if the whole thing doesn’t come flying apart the minute she starts down the aisle.”</p><p>“Where’s the ghost?”</p><p>“Gone, that wretched thing. She’ll be back, though. What I ever did to deserve a hauntin’, I’ll never know.”</p><p>“Maybe she lived here. Before us. Maybe she wants her place back.”</p><p>“And it’s taken her thirty-five years to show up? Uh-uh.”</p><p>“What, then?”</p><p>“Honey, I’m still trying to figure out the reason people do what they do when they’re alive.” She finished ripping out the stitches, sighed audibly, and fit the material into the machine again.</p><p>Candy went to the window and looked out over the apartment courtyard. The management had recently overhauled the space, taking out the grass and flowers that had required watering and replacing them with decorative pebbles. Only the concrete path that had wound through the garden remained. As a child, Candy had ridden her bike between clumps of impatiens and begonia and stands of banana trees, clumsy with their thick, waxy leaves. She knew every turn and straightaway by heart, but, still, there had been danger inherent in each corner, the thrill of heading into the unseen. She’d been eight when she’d made a turn around a bushel of bamboo and seen her mother lying asleep, across the doormat of Marjorie’s apartment. Candy had parked her bike against the wall and squatted down next to Sylvie. She looked pretty lying there, like the illustration of Sleeping Beauty in one of Candy’s library books. Candy watched her for a while, as if studying an insect, noting the little flutters of her eyelids and lips, her long, corded neck, the muscles of which seemed tense, even in sleep. Finally, she stepped over her mother and went inside.</p><p>“Mommy’s back,” she told Marjorie, who was hunched over her machine.</p><p>Together, they carried an incoherent and moaning Sylvie into the bathroom. Candy sat on the lid of the toilet while Marjorie ran the bath, undressed her daughter, and coaxed her into the water. Sylvie cursed her mother, calling her a bitch and a cunt, but Marjorie didn’t react, only shushed her the way she shushed Candy when she was crying over a scraped knee, as if silence trumped pain. Once Sylvie was in the bath, she lay with her eyes closed, head back against the edge of the tub, while Marjorie gently soaped her body, lifting her arms one by one, cleaning between her small breasts and her legs. “Beautiful girl,” she sang in an errant, unidentifiable tune. “Beautiful baby girl.” Later, the three ate chicken with mushroom-soup sauce at the kitchen table and watched MTV on the twenty-one-inch Sony. In the morning, Sylvie was gone, along with the television.</p><p>The apartment was reduced bit by bit over the following years. The microwave followed the television, and then some of Marjorie’s jewelry disappeared. Each time Candy came back to the apartment after school, she entered with trepidation, waiting to see what was missing. The relief she felt when she realized that Sylvie had not stolen anything new was always tempered by disappointment. When she and Marjorie arrived home from church one Sunday to find the space where the stereo had sat looking as vacant as a missing tooth, Candy had felt a rush of elation. Her mother had been in the apartment. Her breath, her dirty, pretty smell still hung in the air. Marjorie never got angry about the thefts. She’d just stand, hands on hips, facing the emptiness, and inhale deeply as if acquainting herself with the new geography of her life.</p><p>But when Candy was ten, and she and Marjorie returned from the grocery store to find that Marjorie’s black Singer Featherweight, the hand-me-down from her mother and grandmother that she had oiled and massaged and kept going for years, was gone, she went to her bedroom and didn’t come out until the following morning. Candy poured herself a bowl of Frosted Flakes and sat on the couch waiting for Marjorie to show her, as she always did, how to skirt this new boulder in her life, but she didn’t open her door.</p><p>“Are you mad?” Candy asked the next morning, when Marjorie finally came out of her room, her face blotchy.</p><p>Marjorie fingered the thin pages of the phone book, looking for the number of a locksmith. “I’m just tired,” she said softly. Two weeks later, Marjorie held Candy’s hand at the kitchen table as they listened to Sylvie struggle to turn her key in the front-door lock.</p><p>“I know you’re in there!” Sylvie yelled, pounding on the door.</p><p>Candy looked at Marjorie, who held her finger to her lips, and the two sat in rigid silence. Giving up on the door, Sylvie came to the kitchen window. She pressed her pallid and wild-eyed face up to the glass so that her nose and lips flattened and distorted.</p><p>“Let her in, Grandma. Please,” Candy said.</p><p>“We don’t want any visitors just now,” Marjorie said.</p><p>For the next year, until her mother’s death, Candy often had the feeling of being shadowed, as if a huge prehistoric bird were passing over her, but when she looked up there was nothing there.</p><p>El Lobo<span data-page="page_6"></span> had his eyes closed when Candy brought in his breakfast the next day, but she knew he wasn’t asleep—there was something too effortful about his breathing. Noisily, she set up the tray table and dragged her chair to the side of his bed. When he finally opened his eyes, he stared, again, at the opposite wall. This time, she did not feed him but simply sat and waited for him to say something. He did not move or shift his gaze. The air in the room stiffened with tension, but neither one gave in. After ten minutes, she rolled the table away from the bed and took the uneaten food from the room. In the hallway, she met up with Tammy, the floor nurse.</p><p>“What happened?” Tammy said, eying the uneaten food.</p><p>“He’s not hungry.”</p><p>“He said this?” Tammy said, warily.</p><p>“He made it clear.”</p><p>“He spoke?”</p><p>“He wasn’t hungry,” Candy repeated. “I’m not supposed to force-feed.”</p><p>“Well,” Tammy said, considering, “did you mark it down?”</p><p>Candy nodded. “Zero in. Zero out.”</p><p>“It’s bath time, anyway. Give me some help.”</p><p>After gathering supplies and filling a small bowl with warm water, Candy came back into El Lobo’s room. Tammy leaned over the bed and pulled El Lobo toward her. “Candy, get the tie,” she said.</p><p>Candy put down her supplies and came around the bed. She saw El Lobo’s dark skin where the hospital gown split open in the back. A fine down feathered away from his spine. She resisted the urge to touch that fur. She undid the tie and watched while Tammy gently laid El Lobo back against his pillows, then drew the gown down past his shoulders and chest. The dressing covering the wound where his arm had been was secured by white bandages that stretched across his breastbone, contrasting with his dark skin and his nearly black nipples.</p><p>“We’re just going to do a little spa treatment!” Tammy said loudly. “How’s that?”</p><p>El Lobo said nothing and Tammy chattered on, explaining that they would not be taking off his dressing but would just wash around it to freshen him up, and that the doctor would be in later to see how he was doing, and wasn’t he doing well, Candy? Good color in his face. Like he’d been to the beach! Have you been sneaking out of here and hitting the beach? Ha-ha-ha. All the while she sponged his chest, neck, and face, and then, reaching down under the blanket with the warm cloth, her head turned to the side as if to control her urge to look, Tammy cleaned him off below. Candy doled out fresh, damp cloths and took away the used ones, then held a bowl under El Lobo’s mouth while Tammy brushed his teeth. Spit! Good one! Spit again! They dressed him in a clean gown. Hello, gorgeous!</p><p>Candy knew just what El Lobo, with his pliant body and immobile gaze, was up to. She felt a warm rush of anger start in her stomach and rise into her throat. She wanted to hit him. She wanted to hear him react.</p><p>“Candy. We have a situation here.”</p><p>Candy looked over and watched as a stain spread across the sheet covering El Lobo’s lower half.</p><p>“That’s just a normal thing, honey,” Tammy said to El Lobo. “You get that warm water down there and it makes you want to go, right?”</p><p>She began to remove the wet sheet covering El Lobo, but her beeper went off. She checked the readout and handed the sheet to Candy. “I’ll call for an orderly,” she said, and left the room.</p><p>Candy looked at El Lobo, whose head was turned away. She left the room, threw the dirty sheet in the laundry chute, and got a clean gown and fresh bedding from the supply closet. She looked down the hall for the orderly, but no one was coming. She waited next to El Lobo’s door. After a few minutes, the orderly still had not come, and Candy was angry. Angry at the hospital for making her take care of this when it was not part of her job, angry because El Lobo had to lie there in his own piss and stink. She moved to the bed, thinking that she would change his tunic first. That would be easy enough to do alone, and by the time she was done the orderly would have arrived. But then she realized that if she did not change the bottom sheet first, his new gown would become wet, and she’d have to do the whole thing over again. So carefully, as if handling something breakable, she rolled El Lobo onto his good side. He was heavier than she expected a person with most of his body missing to be, and he did nothing to help her. When she stopped pushing, he fell back rather than staying on his side. Her frustration with him and his intransigence welled up and she was thinking of leaving, letting him lie in his own mess until the orderly arrived, when she noticed that his eyes were not simply closed but squeezed shut, like those of a child playing hide-and-seek.</p><p>Carefully, she pushed him onto his side again, this time bracing herself against his back as she inched the sheet out from under him. It was hard work, but she was careful not to make<span data-page="page_7"></span> any sounds that would allow him to sense her frustration. She reached for a wet towel and quickly swiped it across the mattress, then shook out a clean sheet and managed to slip it underneath him just as he was becoming too heavy for her to hold where he was. She laid him back down and walked around the bed, working the sheet until it lay reasonably flat. Next, she undid his tunic and pulled it from his body. She plunged a washcloth into the bowl of now lukewarm water and gently cleaned him off. She wiped around his belly and his groin, reached under him to get at his backside. His soft, pale penis lay against his thigh, as bald as a newborn puppy, but she did not take her eyes away. This was his body. It deserved to be seen. She dressed him in a fresh gown, holding him against her chest as she tied the strings. She knew that she could not hold him by the shoulders to lay him back against his pillows because of his pain there, so she kept her arms around his ribs and leaned him all the way down as if she were embracing him. When she pulled away, his eyes were open, and she saw, for a brief second, the arrow of his hatred for her and for everything that had happened to him bending back on itself and aiming straight into his own heart.</p><p>Marjorie was sewing at the machine when the power went out. It was ten o’clock at night, and the darkness was sudden and blinding. For a moment, both Candy and Marjorie froze where they were in the living room.</p><p>“Oh, shoot. I’m just in the middle of something, too,” Marjorie said, finally. “Get the flashlights.”</p><p>Candy felt her way down the hall and into the kitchen, struck by how frightening real darkness was. For a brief moment, she felt panic rise up in her. What if the power never cameback on? What if they all had to grope around in this darkness forever? She turned on the flashlights and brought them into the living room, glad to be near her grandmother again.</p><p>“It’s getting hotter already,” Marjorie said.</p><p>Candy opened the windows to the courtyard, but when she went to the other side of the room to open the street windows for a cross breeze Marjorie stopped her.</p><p>“Thieves,” she said. “They just wait for times like this.”</p><p>Candy could already feel sweat forming in the creases of her underarms and beneath her breasts. She took one of the flashlights and trained it on the thermostat.</p><p>“It’s already eighty in here.”</p><p>Marjorie went to her machine and slid the material out from under the foot. “I guess I’ll have to do this by hand if I’m gonna be finished in time. Shine that light over here.”</p><p>Candy stood above Marjorie and trained her flashlight onto the pearly white material. She watched as her grandmother struggled to thread a needle with fingers that were beginning to bend at odd angles, like old trees.</p><p>“I need glasses,” Marjorie said, missing the eye of the needle and wetting the tip of the thread between her lips.</p><p>“Want me to do it?” Candy offered.</p><p>“I can thread my own needle, thank you. Been doing it half my lifetime.”</p><p>She was successful on the next try, drew the thread out, and tied a knot at the bottom. She adjusted the material on her lap. Candy watched as Marjorie attempted to work the needle through the material in the seed-size stitches required for the seam she was sewing. The stitches were uneven, and Candy waited for Marjorie to stop, or get out her seam ripper, but she continued, her breath coming hard out of her nose as she pursed her lips. Candy felt heat rise in her face as she watched her grandmother’s awkward, determined work.</p><p>“The power will probably come back on soon,” Candy said, trying to keep her voice neutral.</p><p>“And if it doesn’t? I’ve got a bride here who’s not gonna care about my excuses if her dress isn’t ready in time.”</p><p>Candy tried to imagine the bride that her grandmother could see in this material bunched up on her lap. Was she short, tall? Full-breasted or flat? Was her grandmother conjuring up a beauty when the reality was far different?</p><p>“What’s she like?”</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>“The bride.”</p><p>“They’re all the same, you know. Just girls. They don’t know what’s happening to them. Oh! Oh!”</p><p>Candy saw the spot of red and snatched the cloth off her grandmother’s lap before the blood could spread any farther on the material. She reached for her grandmother’s hand. “Don’t move,” she said. “I’ll get a Band-Aid.”</p><p>When she returned from the bathroom, Marjorie was standing and holding the wedding dress out in front of her with her good hand so that it fell into its bodiless shape.</p><p>“It’s pretty,” Candy said.</p><p>“It’s beyond repair.”</p><p>It was impossible to sleep. Even with the windows open, the bedroom was close, the heat making it almost hard to breathe. Candy lay on top of her covers, her arms and legs spread out so that her skin didn’t chafe. Marjorie’s bedroom door opened, and Candy listened as her grandmother went into the bathroom, then she got up quickly. If she was quiet, perhaps she could<span data-page="page_final"></span> catch her grandmother turning on the water. But as her hand touched the doorknob she stopped herself and sat back down on her bed.</p><p>“Get out! Get out! <em>Come on</em>, <em>now!</em> ” she heard her grandmother say, in the gentle, forgiving tone she’d used when she bathed Sylvie or when Candy touched her material with dirty hands, as if their transgressions didn’t really bother her at all, as if she were grateful for the intrusion. ♦</p>	Marisa Silver	December 3, 2007 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/12/03/the-visitor-7	Amputees	Anger	Arthritis	Death	Drug Addicts	Ghosts	Candy	Third	Death
Thirteen Hundred Rats	<p>There <span data-page="page_1"></span>was a man in our village who never in his life had a pet of any kind until his wife died. By my calculation, Gerard Loomis was in his mid-fifties when Marietta was taken from him, but at the ceremony in the chapel he looked so scorched and stricken that people mistook him for a man ten or twenty years older. He sat collapsed in the front pew, his clothes mismatched and his limbs splayed in the extremity of his grief, looking as if he’d been dropped there from a great height, like a bird stripped of its feathers in some aerial catastrophe. Once the funeral was over and we’d all offered up our condolences and gone back to our respective homes, rumors began to circulate. Gerard wasn’t eating. He wouldn’t leave the house or change his clothes. He’d been seen bent over a trash barrel in the front yard, burning patent-leather pumps, brassieres, skirts, wigs, even the mink stole with its head and feet still attached that his late wife had worn with pride on Christmas, Easter, and Columbus Day.</p><p>People began to worry about him, and understandably so. Ours is a fairly close-knit community of a hundred and twenty souls, give or take a few, distributed among some fifty-two stone-and-timber houses that were erected nearly a century ago in what the industrialist B. P. Newhouse hoped would be a model of utopian living. We are not utopians, at least not in this generation, but our village, set as it is in the midst of six hundred acres of dense forest at the end of a consummately discreet road some forty miles from the city, has fostered, we like to think, a closeness and uniformity of outlook that you wouldn’t find in some of the newer developments built right up to the edges of the malls, gallerias, and factory outlets that surround them.</p><p>He should have a dog, people said. That sounded perfectly reasonable to me. My wife and I have a pair of shelties (as well as two lorikeets, whose chatter provides a tranquil backdrop to our evenings by the fireplace, and one very fat angelfish in a tank all his own, on a stand in my study). One evening at dinner, my wife glanced at me over her reading glasses and said, “Do you know that, according to this article in the paper, ninety-seven per cent of pet owners say their pets make them smile at least once a day?” The shelties—Tim and Tim II—gazed up from beneath the table with wondering eyes as I fed scraps of meat into their mobile and receptive mouths.</p><p>“You think I ought to speak with him?” I said. “Gerard, I mean?”</p><p>“It couldn’t hurt,” my wife said. And then, the corners of her mouth sinking toward her chin, she added, “The poor man.”</p><p>I went to visit him the next day—a Saturday, as it happened. The dogs needed walking, so I took them both with me, by way of example, I suppose, and because when I’m home—and not away on the business that takes me all over the world, sometimes for weeks or even months at a time—I like to give them as much attention as I can. Gerard’s cottage was half a mile or so from our house, and I enjoyed the briskness of the season—it was early December, the holidays coming on, a fresh breeze spanking my cheeks. I let the dogs run free ahead of me and admired the way the pine forest that B. P. Newhouse had planted all those years ago framed and sculpted the sky. The first thing I noticed on coming up the walk was that Gerard hadn’t bothered to rake the leaves from his lawn or cover any of his shrubs against the frost. There were other signs of neglect: the storm windows weren’t up yet, garbage overspilled the two cans in the driveway, and a pine bough, a casualty of the last storm, lay across the roof of the house like the severed hand of a giant. I rang the bell.</p><p>Gerard was a long time answering. When he did finally come to the door, he held it open just a crack and gazed out at me as if I were a stranger. (I was nothing of the sort—our parents had known each other, we’d played couples bridge for years and had once taken a road trip to Hyannis Port together, not to mention the fact that we saw each other at the lake nearly every day in the summer, shared cocktails at the clubhouse, and basked in an air of mutual congratulation over our separate decisions not to complicate our lives with the burden of children.)</p><p>“Gerard,” I said. “Hello. How are you feeling?”</p><p>He said nothing. He looked thinner than usual, haggard. I wondered if the rumors were true—that he wasn’t eating, wasn’t taking care of himself, that he’d given way to despair.</p><p>“I was just passing by and thought I’d stop in,” I said, working up a grin, though I didn’t feel much in the mood for levity and had begun to wish I’d stayed home and let my neighbor suffer in peace. “And look,” I said, “I’ve brought Tim and Tim II with me.” The dogs, hearing their names, drew themselves up out of the frost-blighted bushes and pranced across the doormat, inserting the long<span data-page="page_2"></span> damp tubes of their snouts into the crack of the door.</p><p>Gerard’s voice was hoarse. “I’m allergic to dogs,” he said.</p><p>Ten minutes later, after we’d gone through the preliminaries and I was seated on the cluttered couch in front of the dead fireplace while Tim and Tim II whined from the front porch, I said, “Well, what about a cat?” And then, because I was mortified at the state to which he’d sunk—his clothes were grubby; he smelled; the house was like the lounge in a transient hotel—I found myself quoting my wife’s statistic about smiling pet owners.</p><p>“I’m allergic to cats, too,” he said. He was perched uncomfortably on the canted edge of a rocker and his eyes couldn’t seem to find my face. “But I understand your concern, and I appreciate it. And you’re not the first. Half a dozen people have been by, pushing one thing or another on me—pasta salad, a baked ham, profiteroles, and pets, too. Siamese fighting fish, hamsters, kittens. Mary Martinson caught me at the post office the other day, took hold of my arm, and lectured me for fifteen minutes on the virtues of emus. Can you believe it?”</p><p>“I feel foolish,” I said.</p><p>“No, don’t. You’re right, all of you—I need to snap out of it. And you’re right about a pet, too.” He rose from the chair, which rocked crazily behind him. He was wearing a stained pair of white corduroy shorts and a sweatshirt that made him look as gaunt as the Masai my wife and I had photographed on our safari to Kenya the previous spring. “Let me show you,” he said, and he wound his way through the tumbling stacks of magazines and newspapers scattered around the room and disappeared into the back hall. I sat there, feeling awkward—was this what it would be like if my wife should die before me?—but curious, too. And, in a strange way, validated. Gerard Loomis had a pet to keep him company: mission accomplished.</p><p>When he came back into the room, I thought at first that he’d slipped into some sort of garish jacket or cardigan, but then I saw, with a little jolt of surprise, that he was wearing a snake. Or, that is, a snake was draped over his shoulders, its extremities dangling beyond the length of his arms. “It’s a python,” he said. “Burmese. They get to be twenty-five feet long, though this one’s just a baby.”</p><p>I must have said something, but I can’t really recall now what it was. I wasn’t a herpetophobe or anything like that. It was just that a snake wasn’t what we’d had in mind. Snakes didn’t play fetch, didn’t bound into the car panting their joy, didn’t speak when you held a rawhide bone just above shoulder level and twitched it invitingly. As far as I knew, they didn’t do much of anything, except exist. And bite.</p><p>“So what do you think?” he said. His voice lacked enthusiasm, as if he were trying to convince himself.</p><p>“Nice,” I said.</p><p>I don’t know why I’m telling this story—perhaps because what happened to Gerard could happen to any of us, I suppose, especially as we age and our spouses age and we’re increasingly set adrift. But the thing is, the next part of what I’m going to relate here is a kind of fiction, really, or a fictive reconstruction of actual events, because two days after I was introduced to Gerard’s python—he was thinking then of naming it either Jason or Siddhartha—my wife and I went off to Switzerland for an account I was overseeing there and didn’t return for more than four months. In the interval, here’s what happened.</p><p>There was a heavy snowfall the week before Christmas that year, and for the space of nearly two days the power lines were down. Gerard woke the first morning to a preternaturally cold house, and his first thought was for the snake. The man in the pet shop at the mall had given him a long lecture before he bought the animal. “They make great pets,” he’d said. “You can let them roam the house if you want, and they’ll find the places where they’re comfortable. And the nice thing is they’ll come to you and curl up on the couch or wherever, because of your body heat, you understand.” The man—he wore a name tag that read “Bozeman” and he looked to be in his forties, with a gray-flecked goatee and his hair drawn back in a patchily dyed ponytail—clearly enjoyed dispensing advice. As well he should, seeing that he was charging some four hundred dollars for a single reptile that must have been as common as a garden worm in its own country. “But most of all, especially in this weather, you’ve got to keep him warm. This is a tropical animal we’re talking about here, you understand? Never—and I mean never—let the temperature fall below eighty.”</p><p>Gerard tried the light on the nightstand, but it was out. Ditto the light in the hall. Outside, the snow fell in clumps, as if it had been preformed into snowballs somewhere high in the troposphere. In the living room, the thermostat read sixty-three degrees, and when he tried to click the heat on nothing happened. The next thing he knew he was crumpling newspaper and stacking kindling in the fireplace,<span data-page="page_3"></span> and where were the matches? A quick search around the house, everything a mess (and here the absence of Marietta bit into him, down deep, like a parasitical set of teeth), the drawers stuffed with refuse, dishes piled high, nothing where it was supposed to be. Finally, he retrieved an old lighter from a pair of paint-stained jeans on the floor in the back of the closet and he had the fire going. Then he went looking for Siddhartha. He found the snake curled up under the kitchen sink where the hot-water pipe fed into the faucet and dishwasher, but it was all but inanimate, as cold and slick as a garden hose left out in the frost.</p><p>It was surprisingly heavy, especially for an animal that hadn’t eaten in the two weeks it had been in the house, but he dragged it, stiff and frigid, from its <em>cachette</em> and laid it before the fireplace. While he was making coffee in the kitchen, he gazed out the window on the tumble of the day and thought of all those years that he’d gone to work in weather like this, in all weathers, actually, and felt a stab of nostalgia. Maybe he should go back to work—if not in his old capacity, from which he was gratefully retired, then on a part-time basis, just to keep his hand in, just to get out of the house and do something useful. On impulse he picked up the phone, thinking to call Alex, his old boss, and sound him out, but the line was down, too.</p><p>Back in the living room, he sank into the couch with his coffee and watched the snake as it came slowly back to itself, its muscles shivering in slow waves from head to tail, like a soft breeze trailing over a still body of water. By the time he’d had a second cup of coffee and fixed himself an egg on the gas range, the crisis—if that was what it was—had passed. Siddhartha seemed fine. He never moved much even in the best of times, with the heat on high and the electric blanket that Gerard had bought for him draped across the big Plexiglas terrarium he liked to curl up in, so it was difficult to say. Gerard sat there a long while, stoking the fire, watching the snake unfurl its muscles and flick the dark fork of its tongue, until a thought came to him: Maybe Siddhartha was hungry. When Gerard had asked the pet-shop proprietor what to feed him, Bozeman had answered, “Rats.” Gerard must have looked dubious, because the man had added, “Oh, I mean, you can give him rabbits when he gets bigger, and that’s a savings, really, in time and energy, because you won’t have to feed him as often, but you’d be surprised—snakes, reptiles in general, are a lot more efficient than we are. They don’t have to stoke the internal furnace all the time with filet mignon and hot-fudge sundaes, and they don’t need clothes or fur coats, either.” He paused to gaze down at the snake, where it lay in its terrarium, basking under a heat lamp. “I just fed this guy his rat yesterday. You shouldn’t have to give him anything for a week or two, anyway. He’ll let you know.”</p><p>“How?” Gerard had asked.</p><p>A shrug. “Could be a color thing, where you notice his pattern isn’t as bright, maybe. Or he’s just, I don’t know, what you’d call lethargic.”</p><p>They’d both looked down at the snake then, its eyes like two pebbles, its body all but indistinguishable from the length of rough wood it was stretched out on. It was no more animate than the glass walls of the terrarium, and Gerard wondered how anyone, even an expert, could tell if the thing was alive or dead. Then he wrote the check.</p><p>But now he found himself chafing at an idea: the snake needed to be fed. Of course it did. It had been two weeks—why hadn’t he thought of it before? He was neglecting the animal, and that wasn’t right. He got up from the couch to close off the room and build up the fire, then went out to shovel the driveway and take the car down the long, winding community road to the highway and on into Newhouse and the mall. It was a harrowing journey. Trucks threw blankets of slush over the windshield, and the beating of the wipers made him dizzy. When he arrived, he was relieved to see that the mall had electricity, the whole place lit up like a Las Vegas parade for the marketing and selling of all things Christmas, and with a little deft maneuvering he was able to wedge his car between a plowed drift and the handicapped space in front of the pet store.</p><p>Inside, Pets &amp; Company smelled of nature in the raw, every creature in every cage and glassed-in compartment having defecated simultaneously, just to greet him, or so he imagined. The place was superheated. He was the only customer. Bozeman was up on a footstool, cleaning one of the aquariums with a vacuum tube. “Hey, man,” he said, his voice a high singsong. “Gerard, right? Don’t tell me.” He reached back in a practiced gesture to smooth down his ponytail, as if he were petting a cat or a ferret. “You<span data-page="page_4"></span> need a rat. Am I right?”</p><p>The rat—he didn’t see it; Bozeman had gone into the back room to fetch it—came in a cardboard container with a molded carrying handle on top, the sort of thing you got if you asked for a doggie bag at a restaurant. The animal was heavier than Gerard had expected, shifting its weight mysteriously from one corner of the box to another as he carried it out into the snow and set it on the seat beside him. He turned on the fan after he’d started up the engine, to give it some heat—but then it was a mammal, he figured, with fur, and it could warm itself. And, in any case, it was dinner, or soon to be. The roads were slick. Visibility was practically zero. He crawled behind a snowplow all the way back to Newhouse Gardens, and when he came in the door he was pleased to see that the fire was still going strong.</p><p>All right. He set down the box and then dragged the python’s terrarium across the floor from the bedroom to the living room and set it to one side of the fireplace. Then he lifted the snake—it was noticeably warm to the touch on the side that had been closest to the fire—and laid it gently in the terrarium. For a moment, it came to life, the long run of muscles tensing, the great flat slab of the head gearing around to regard him out of its stony eyes, and then it was inert again, dead weight against the Plexiglas floor. Gerard bent cautiously to the rat’s box—would it spring out, bite him, then scurry away across the floor to live behind the baseboard forever, like some cartoon incarnation?—and, with his heart pounding, lowered the box into the terrarium and opened the lid.</p><p>The rat—it was white, with pink eyes, like the lab rats he’d seen arrayed in their cages in the biology building when he was a student—slid from the box like a lump of gristle, then sat up on its haunches and began cleaning itself, as if it were the most natural thing in the world to be transported in a doggie bag and dumped into a glass-walled cavern in the presence of a tongue-flicking reptile. Which might or might not be hungry.</p><p>For a long while, nothing happened. Snow ticked at the windows, the fire sparked and settled. And then the snake moved ever so slightly, the faintest shifting of the bright tube of its scales, energy percolating from the deepest core of its musculature, and suddenly the rat stiffened. All at once it was aware of the danger it was in. It seemed to shrink into itself, as if by doing so it could somehow become invisible. Gerard watched, fascinated, wondering how the rat—reared in some drowsy pet warehouse, slick and pink and suckling at its mother’s teats in a warm gregarious pack of its pink siblings, generations removed from the wild and any knowledge of a thing like this snake and its shining elongate bulk—could recognize the threat. Very slowly, by almost imperceptible degrees, the snake lifted its head from the Plexiglas floor, levelling on the rat like a sculpture come to life. Then it struck, so quickly that Gerard nearly missed it, but the rat, as if it had trained all its life for just this moment, was equal to it. It sprang over the snake’s head in a single frantic leap and shot to the farthest corner of the terrarium, where it began to emit a series of birdlike cries, all the while fastening its inflamed eyes on the white hovering face of Gerard. And what did he feel? He felt like a god, like a Roman emperor with the power of fatality in his thumb. The rat scrabbled at the Plexiglas. The snake shifted to close in on it.</p><p>And then, because he was a god, Gerard reached into the terrarium and lifted the rat up out of the range of his python. He was surprised at how warm the animal was, and how quickly it accommodated itself to his hand. It didn’t struggle or try to escape but simply pressed itself against his wrist and the trailing sleeve of his sweater as if it understood, as if it were grateful. In the next moment he was cradling the rat against his chest, the pulse of its heart already slowing. He went to the couch and sank into it, uncertain what to do next. The rat gazed up at him, shivered the length of its body, and promptly fell asleep.</p><p>The situation was novel, to say the least. Gerard had never touched a rat in his life, let alone allowed one to curl up and sleep in the weave of his sweater. He watched its miniature chest rise and fall, studied the intricacy of its naked feet that were like hands, saw the spray of etiolated whiskers, and felt the suppleness of the tail as it lay between his fingers like the suède fringe of the jacket he’d worn as a boy. The fire faltered, but he didn’t rise to feed it. When finally he got up to open a can of soup, the rat came with him, awake now and discovering its natural perch on his shoulder. He felt its fur like a<span data-page="page_5"></span> caress on the side of his neck, and then the touch of its whiskers and fevered nose. It stood on its hind legs and stretched from Gerard’s lap to the edge of the table as he spooned up his soup by candlelight, and he couldn’t resist the experiment of extracting a cube of potato from the rich golden broth and feeding it into the eager, mincing mouth. And then another. And another. When he went to bed, the rat came with him, and if he woke in the dark of the night—and he did, twice, three times—he felt its presence beside him, its spirit, its heart, its heat, and it was no reptile, no cold thankless thing with a flicking tongue and two dead eyes, but a creature radiant with life.</p><p>The house was very cold when he woke to the seeping light of morning. He sat up in bed and looked around him. The face of the clock radio was blank, so the electricity must still have been down. He wondered about that, but when he pushed himself up and set his bare feet on the floor it was the rat he was thinking about—and there it was, nestled in a fold of the blankets. It opened its eyes, stretched, and then climbed into the palm he offered it, working its way up inside the sleeve of his pajamas until it was balanced on his shoulder again. In the kitchen, he turned on all four gas burners and the oven, too, and shut off the room to trap the heat. It wasn’t until the kettle began to boil that he thought about the fireplace—and the snake stretched out in its terrarium—but by then it was too late.</p><p>He returned to the pet store that afternoon, reasoning that he might as well convert the snake’s lair into a rat’s nest. Or no, that didn’t sound right—that was what his mother used to call his boyhood room. He’d call it a rat apartment. A rat hostel. A rat— Bozeman grinned when he saw him. “Not another rat?” he said, something quizzical in his eyes. “He can’t want another one already, can he? But then with Burms you’ve got to watch for obesity—they’ll eat anytime, whether they’re hungry or not.”</p><p>Even under the best of conditions, Gerard was not the sort to confide in people he barely knew. “Yes” was all he said, in answer to both questions. And then he added, “I may as well take a couple of them while I’m here.” He looked away. “To save me the trip.”</p><p>Bozeman wiped his hands on the khaki apron he wore over his jeans and came out from behind the cash register. “Sure,” he said. “Good idea. How many you want? They’re five ninety-nine each.”</p><p>Gerard shrugged. He thought of the rat at home, the snugness of it, the way it sprang across the carpet in a series of little leaps or shot along the baseboard as if blown by a hurricane wind, how it would take a nut in its hands and sit up to gnaw at it, how it loved to play with anything he gave it—a paper clip, an eraser, the ridged plastic top of an Evian bottle. In a moment of inspiration, he decided to call it Robbie, after his brother in Tulsa. Robbie. Robbie the Rat. And Robbie needed company, needed playmates, just like any other creature. Before he could think, he said, “Ten?”</p><p>“Ten? Whoa, man, that is going to be one fat snake.”</p><p>“Is that too many?”</p><p>Bozeman slicked back his ponytail and gave him a good, long look. “Hell, no—I mean, I’ll sell you all I’ve got if that’s what you want, and everything else, too. You want gerbils? Parakeets? Albino toads? I’m in business, you know—pets for sale. This is a pet shop, <em>comprende</em>? But I tell you, if that Burm doesn’t eat them P.D.Q., you’re going to see how fast these things breed. . . . I mean, the females can go into heat, or whatever you want to call it, at five weeks old. Five weeks.” He shifted his weight and moved past Gerard, gesturing for him to follow. They stopped in front of a display of packaged food and bright-colored sacks of litter. “You’re going to want Rat Chow,” he said, handing him a ten-pound sack, “and a bag or two of these wood shavings.” Another look. “You got a place to keep them?”</p><p>By the time he left the store, Gerard had two wire cages (with cedar-plank flooring so the rats wouldn’t contract bumblefoot, whatever that was), twenty pounds of rat food, three bags of litter, and two super-sized doggie bags with five rats in each. Then he was home and shutting the door to keep out the cold even as Robbie, emerging from beneath the pillows of the couch, humped across the floor to greet him and all the lights flashed on simultaneously.</p><p>It was mid-April by the time my wife and I returned from Switzerland. Tim and Tim II, who’d been cared for in our absence by our housekeeper, Florencia, were there to greet us, acting out their ecstasy on the doorstep and then carrying it into the living room with such an excess of animation that it was all but impossible to get our bags in the door before giving them their treats,<span data-page="page_6"></span> a thorough back-scratching, and a cooed rehearsal of the little endearments they were used to. It was good to be home, back to a real community, after all that time spent living in a sterile apartment in Basel, and, what with making the rounds of the neighbors and settling in both at home and at work, it wasn’t till some weeks later that I thought of Gerard. No one had seen him, save for Mary Martinson, who’d run into him in the parking lot at the mall, and he’d refused all invitations to dinner, casual get-togethers, ice-skating on the lake, even the annual Rites of Spring fund-raiser at the clubhouse. Mary said that he’d seemed distracted and that she’d tried to engage him in conversation, thinking he was still locked in that first stage of grieving and just needed a little nudge to get him on track again, but he’d been abrupt with her. And she didn’t like to mention it but he was unkempt—and he smelled worse than ever. It was startling, she said. Even outdoors, standing over the open trunk of his car, which was entirely filled, she couldn’t help noticing, with something called Rat Chow, even with the wind blowing and a lingering chill in the air, he gave off a powerful reek of sadness and body odor. Someone needed to look in on him, that was her opinion.</p><p>I waited till the weekend, and then, as I’d done back in December, I took the dogs down the wide, amicable streets, through the greening woods, and over the rise to Gerard’s cottage. The day was glorious, the sun climbing toward its zenith, moths and butterflies spangling the flower gardens, the breeze sweetened with a scent of the South. My neighbors slowed their cars to wave as they passed, and a few people stopped to chat, their engines rumbling idly. Carolyn Porterhouse thrust a bouquet of tulips at me and a mysterious wedge-shaped package wrapped in butcher paper, which proved to be an Emmentaler—“Welcome home,” she said, her grin anchored by a layer of magenta lipstick—and Ed Saperstein stopped right in the middle of the road to tell me about a trip to the Bahamas that he and his wife had taken on a chartered yacht. It was past one by the time I got to Gerard’s.</p><p>I noticed right off that not much had changed. The windows were streaked with dirt, and the yard, sprouting weeds along the margins of the unmowed lawn, looked as neglected as ever. The dogs bolted off after something in the deep grass, and I shifted the bouquet under one arm, figuring I’d hand it to Gerard, to cheer him up a bit, and rang the bell. There was no answer. I tried a second time, then made my way along the side of the house, thinking to peer in the windows—for all anyone knew, he could be ill, or even, God forbid, dead.</p><p>The windows were nearly opaque, with a scrim of some sort of pale fluff or dander. I rapped at the glass and thought I saw movement within, a kaleidoscopic shifting of shadowy forms, but couldn’t be sure. It was then that I noticed the odor, saturated and bottom-heavy with ammonia, like the smell of a poorly run kennel. I mounted the back steps through a heavy accounting of discarded microwave-dinner trays and a tidal drift of feed bags and knocked uselessly at the door. The wind stirred. I looked down at the refuse at my feet and saw the legend “Rat Chow” replicated over and over in neon-orange letters, and that should have been all the information I needed. Yet how was I to guess? How was anyone?</p><p>Later, after I’d presented the bouquet and the cheese to my wife, I tried Gerard’s phone and, to my surprise, he answered on the fourth or fifth ring. “Hello, Gerard,” I said, trying to work as much heartiness into my voice as I could. “It’s me, Roger, back from the embrace of the Swiss. I stopped by today to say hello, but—”</p><p>He cut me off then, his voice husky and low, almost a whisper. “Yes, I know,” he said. “Robbie told me.”</p><p>If I wondered who Robbie was—a roommate? a female?—I didn’t linger over it. “Well,” I said, “how’re things? Looking up?” He didn’t answer. I listened to the sound of his breathing for a moment, then added, “Would you like to get together? Maybe come over for dinner?”</p><p>There was another long pause. Finally, he said, “I can’t do that.”</p><p>I wasn’t going to let him off so lightly. We were friends. I had a responsibility. We lived in a community where people cared about one another and where the loss of a single individual was a loss to us all. I tried to inject a little jocularity into my voice: “Well, why not? Too far to travel? I’ll grill you a nice steak and open a bottle of Côtes du Rhône.”</p><p>“Too busy,” he said. And then he said something I couldn’t quite get hold of at the time. “It’s nature,” he said. “The force of nature.”</p><p>“What are you talking about?”</p><p>“I’m overwhelmed,” he said, so softly that I could barely hear him, and then his breathing trailed off and the phone went dead.</p><p>They found him a week later. The next-door neighbors, Paul and<span data-page="page_final"></span> Peggy Bartlett, noticed the smell, which seemed to intensify as the days went on, and when there was no answer at the door they called the Fire Department. I’m told that when the firemen broke down the front door a sea of rodents flooded out into the yard, fleeing in every direction. Inside, the floors were gummy with waste, and everything, from the furniture to the plasterboard walls and the oak beams of the living-room ceiling, had been gnawed and whittled till the place was all but unrecognizable. In addition to the free-roaming animals, there were hundreds more rats stacked in cages, most of them starving and many cannibalized or displaying truncated limbs. A spokeswoman for the local A.S.P.C.A. estimated that there were upward of thirteen hundred rats in the house, most of which had to be euthanized at the shelter because they were in no condition to be sent out for adoption.</p><p>As for Gerard, he’d apparently succumbed to pneumonia, though there were rumors of hantavirus, which really put a chill into the community, especially with so many of the rodents still at large. We all felt bad for him, of course, I more than anyone else. If only I’d been home through the winter, I kept thinking, if only I’d persisted when I’d stood outside his window and caught the odor of decay, perhaps I could have saved him. But then I kept coming back to the idea that there must have been some deep character flaw in him that none of us had recognized—he’d chosen a snake for a pet, for God’s sake, and that low animal had somehow morphed into this horde of creatures that could only be described as pests, as vermin, as enemies of mankind that should be exterminated, not nurtured. And that was another thing that neither my wife nor I could understand: how could he allow even a single one of them to come near him, to fall under the caress of his hand, to sleep with him, eat with him, breathe the same air?</p><p>For the first two nights, I could barely sleep, playing over that horrific scene in my mind. How could Gerard have sunk so far? How could anyone?</p><p>The ceremony was brief, the casket closed (and there wasn’t one of us who wanted to speculate on the reason, though it didn’t take an especially active imagination to picture Gerard’s final moments). I was very tender with my wife afterward. We went out to lunch with some of the others, and when we got home I pressed her to me and held her for a long while. And though I was exhausted, I took the dogs out on the lawn to throw them their ball and watch the way the sun struck their rollicking fur as they streaked after the rumor of it, only to bring it back, again and again, and lay it in my palm, still warm from the embrace of their jaws. ♦</p>	T.

Total Solar	<p>I was staring at a brown sky. Just moments earlier, a researcher from the United Nations Ornithological Department had told me that fecal particulate from the city’s open sewage system made up an alarming proportion of the atmosphere in Kabul. The researcher was the sort of person who would say, “If you really want something to write about . . .” or “You’re looking for a story? What if I were to tell you . . . ,” as if, before meeting him, you had lived in darkness, scribbling claptrap of zero consequence to anybody. He’d invited me to lunch because he had some urgent information regarding birds. Something to do with the great migrations above the Hindu Kush, the desertification of Iranian wetlands, mass extinction. “Have you ever seen a Siberian crane?” he asked me. “No, you haven’t. No one in Afghanistan has seen a Siberian crane in the past twenty years.”</p><p>I pretended to take notes. My notepad, back then, was mostly pretend notes. Many of the pages featured detailed sketches of me killing myself by various means. One especially tedious interview—with a mullah, another fucking mullah holding forth from behind a vertical index finger—had yielded a kind of comic strip of me leaping from a skyscraper, shooting myself midair, and landing in front of a bus.</p><p>A waiter appeared and asked whether we wanted any coffee. He wore an anachronistic tribal costume and a prayer cap adorned with sequins. The garb complemented the restaurant’s verdant rose garden, the pleasantly burbling fountain, and the private gazebo in which we sat, surrounded by paisley tapestries.</p><p>“I already told you I don’t drink coffee,” the researcher said. “I wanted pomegranate juice.”</p><p>“One pomegranate juice?” the waiter asked.</p><p>“Not now. Now it’s too late.” The researcher pointed at his plate. “Now I’ve eaten.”</p><p>“No pomegranate juice?” the waiter asked.</p><p>“No pomegranate juice,” the researcher said. “Bring me a green tea. Can you manage a green tea?”</p><p>“One Afghan chai.”</p><p>“I’ll have one as well,” I said.</p><p>“Two Afghan chai.”</p><p>As soon as the waiter turned his back, the researcher rolled his eyes. “<em>Afghan chai.</em> It’s Lipton, for Christ’s sake. I’m sorry, what was I saying? Ah, yes, you’ve never seen a Siberian crane . . .”</p><p>I returned to my sketch. A few days before, I’d posted a minor Web item about a contractor who’d got himself decapitated down in Kandahar. There was a new technique, it seemed. Rather than a knife, they used wire. They looped the wire around your neck, stepped on your back, and pulled up with a rapid sawing motion. Picture a bowler polishing a bowling ball. Anyway, I was trying to draw the researcher doing this to me (while, at the same time, I double-fisted a bottle of rat poison and a bottle of arsenic), but I was distracted by the gardener, a bearded man dressed in the same traditional clothes as the waiter, roaming the grounds with a pair of clippers. Every couple of steps, the gardener would pause, seat the stem of a rose between the two blades, begin to squeeze, think better, release the stem, and continue on his way. I watched him do this maybe half a dozen times.</p><p>My failure to sympathize with the birds—which, thanks to the drones and the Arabs and the fecal particulate, appeared to be suffering an unprecedented genocide—was no doubt attributable in part to my hangover. The night before, I’d stayed too long at the Norwegian Embassy. I’d been trying to get into the pants suit of a consultant for the World Bank. She was new to Kabul and, I sensed, typically stimulated by the proximity of violence and privation. (Not the reality, never the reality—the <em>proximity</em>.) Hours of careful effort had been undermined by a brief, emasculating incident at the snacks table. We were loading up our paper napkins when a drunk Frenchman stumbled over and began dipping pieces of bruschetta into the bowl of tomato salad. I knew this Frenchman. He was into gemstones or helicopter parts or the like, and he was a dangerous, erratic alcoholic. Therefore, although the Frenchman was polluting the tomato salad with his dirty French fingernails and even his hairy French knuckles, I pretended not to notice. Not so my consultant. The thing to do was to use a fork, she communicated to the Frenchman by offering him one. The Frenchman smiled at us, took the fork, and stabbed it in the wall, where it stuck like a dart. Then he sank his fist into the bowl of tomato salad, all the way to the wrist, and turned it like a pestle before lifting out a dripping handful. This the Frenchman brutally flung onto the bruschetta, which, when he offered it to me, I somehow lacked the courage to decline.</p><p>“Coffee?” the waiter said. I looked up to see him placing two steaming mugs on our table. The researcher drew a breath.</p><p>I was staring at a brown sky. I sat up. The first thing I noticed was a leg. It stood a yard from me, still socked and shoed, as if it had come detached midstride. Next I saw the hole in the wall. It looked as if a wrecking ball had been swung through. Cinder blocks and sandbags and concertina wire all lay in a dusty heap. A<span data-page="page_2"></span> dog sat on top of the heap. The dog—one of those Kabuli street hounds glistening with bald patches, a tumor the size of a cantaloupe hanging between its haunches, and no doubt an ear infection that caused it to list and wander in psychotic circles—was barking mutely. I realized I was deaf. All I could detect was a high-pitched tone, like a test of the emergency broadcast system. The emergency broadcast system? I thought. Jesus, I was getting old. Then I wondered: <em>Tinnitus</em>—rhymes with “hit us” or “smite us”?</p><p>Maybe this was only a test.</p><p>I was watching a woman pull a long splinter out of her cheek. It kept coming out, like a magic trick.</p><p>“Sue?” I said.</p><p>It was Sue Kwan, from Human Rights Watch. She’d been at the Norwegian Embassy, too. I’d bluntly propositioned her after abasing myself in front of the World Bank consultant. Kwan had rebuffed me so gently, with such pity. I’d responded by calling her latest report biased and confusingly structured.</p><p>Now she looked at me, wide-eyed, unable to answer on account of the splinter.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Sue,” I said.</p><p>I can only imagine how absurd it sounded. Sue, though, seemed not to have heard me, either. I followed her gaze back to the hole in the wall. Several men with rifles were climbing over the rubble, into the garden.</p><p>Sue Kwan was a good source. She always gave me early drafts of her reports, despite her organization’s rules against doing so. Furthermore, her motives, unlike those of most of us, weren’t really suspect. She was not stimulated by the proximity of violence and privation. A genuine person, Kwan: she was there to help. Of course, I often went around deriding her for being stupid and naïve.</p><p>I remember this one time, we were sharing a taxi, sitting in traffic after a party at the Dutch Embassy, when a street urchin carrying a crate of eggs collapsed on the sidewalk and began convulsing and foaming at the mouth. The old fake-a-seizure gimmick—but Sue fell for it. She got out of the taxi and crouched over the boy.</p><p>“Sue, get back in the car!” I shouted.</p><p>“He needs help,” she said.</p><p>“It’s a trick,” I told her. “It’s fake.”</p><p>And here Sue turned on me a look that I recognized immediately. It was the look I’d always imagined God would have were I ever forced to meet Him.</p><p>“So what?” she said.</p><p>So what!</p><p>Maybe she wasn’t so stupid, naïve. But, then, why had she raised her hand? Why was she waving at the men with guns climbing through the wall? Did she actually think they were there to help? Or could it be that Sue was offering herself, at last making the sacrifice she’d been put on earth to make?</p><p>“No, Sue,” I said.</p><p>She paid no heed. She kept waving. One of the men lifted his rifle and shot her in the stomach. Sue slumped forward, and the man walked up and shot her in the head. That was the end of Sue Kwan. That was the death of one of the few genuine, unsuspect people I encountered during all my time over there.</p><p>Or one of the stupidest, the most naïve.</p><p>The gunmen were clean-shaven, clad in normal city attire. There were four of them. Each had a Kalashnikov with a banana clip duct-taped upside down to another banana clip. This way, when the first banana clip was empty, the gunman could simply eject it and flip it over, rather than having to fumble around in his pocket or what have you, wasting precious shooting time.</p><p>One of them wore an opalescent vest that seemed to shimmer and undulate in the sunlight. What was opalescent and seemed to shimmer and undulate in the sunlight? Pearls, I thought.</p><p>Then I thought: ball bearings.</p><p>They did not dally, these four. They got right down to killing. The gunman who’d shot Kwan appeared to be the leader. He yelled instructions to his comrades, who fanned out and started finishing off the survivors of the blast. I watched one execute a fat American who looked vaguely familiar. Yes, he was D.E.A., an adviser or analyst working on the poppy problem. He was down among the roses, bloody and weeping. When the gunman loomed over him, pointing the muzzle at his face, this fellow did the most peculiar thing. He grasped the travel wallet that hung around his neck—a transparent window on the front displaying his security-clearance badge—and held it up.</p><p>It was around this time that I lay back down in the grass. I don’t know how long I lay there. My eyes were shut. There was the tone, was all there was—the tone and, somewhere beyond the tone, the faint pop of rifles like I was underwater, I was underground. Tinnitus or tinnitus? Smite us or hit us? Years before, I’d made the mistake of doing a live piece-to-camera for CNN. While reading the cue card I’d written for myself, I’d pronounced “misled” as if it rhymed with “guy’s old.” On the progress of the war in Afghanistan, the successes of the surge, the President had <em>myzled</em> the public. The YouTube video had been viewed many, many times—many more times, certainly, than any story I’d ever reported. That fucking YouTube video was going to be my legacy.</p><p>Imagine: the<span data-page="page_3"></span> vanity, the <em>inanity</em>, of these final meditations. YouTube! Well, Sue Kwan wasn’t the only one who would die as she had lived.</p><p>I felt a kind of <em>thwump</em> reverberate from the earth into my body, and a hot cushion of air lifted me off the ground. It lifted me and transported me somewhere else and set me down.</p><p>I sat up. I opened my eyes.</p><p>It was difficult to see in all the dust and debris. It felt like nighttime. But not exactly nighttime—more like an eclipse, a total solar. Dark figures, silhouettes, flitted about. As the air began to clear, I saw that they were pouring into the garden through the hole in the wall. Most of them wore uniforms—they were soldiers, police. The shooting seemed to have stopped. I got to my feet. I was a little wobbly, a little wobbly. I tried a couple of steps, then a couple more. I tripped on something and fell to the ground. When I looked back to see what it was, I discovered an arm. First the leg—now this, an arm. I knew there must be heads around. For once, I didn’t want to see them; just knowing they were around was enough.</p><p>The arm looked as if it had been sprayed with buckshot. Silver was embedded in the flesh. I thought of pearls in a mollusk. (Not pearls, though, I thought.) A tactical-looking watch was still strapped around the wrist. I knew that watch. It belonged to the researcher from the United Nations Ornithological Department.</p><p>O.K., stop looking at the arm.</p><p>I got up again. No one seemed to notice me. I scaled the rubble pile. I walked right past the soldiers and the police, through the hole in the wall, and into the street.</p><p>There were vehicles everywhere: mostly Toyota HiLuxes, but also up-armored Humvees with machine-gun turrets, Mine Resistant Ambush Protected personnel carriers, and S.U.V.s whose tinted windows were decorated with portraits of illustrious war criminals. Commanders screamed into their radios, subordinates rushed around, limp corpses were loaded into trucks. The first TV crews had already arrived—a few local teams and the BBC. They were prepping their gear, jostling for position. One of the screaming commanders spotted them, holstered his radio, took a comb out of his breast pocket, and headed over, combing his hair.</p><p>I’d avoided the TV crowd ever since the whole CNN episode, and now I turned away, hoping they hadn’t seen me. There was something else, too. I was, for some reason, embarrassed. Not misled/myzled embarrassed—more naked-in-a-dream embarrassed. The source of my naked-in-a-dream embarrassment was never the nakedness. It was always the fact that I alone had managed to get myself into such a situation while everyone else on the submarine or whatever had managed to avoid it. What did it say about me, the sort of person I was?</p><p>I had arrived at the end of the block. I stood there, unsure what to do next. Walk back to the TV crews and the commanders and the subordinates? Tap one of them on the shoulder and explain that I had been in the garden, I had survived the attack, I came from the other side of the wall? After a while, it struck me that my only option was to keep going.</p><p>It was starting to get dark. I passed men fanning coals at kebab stands, fruit venders, toy stores, cobblers repairing sandals on the sidewalk outside the mosque. I experienced the drug-and-urine fragrance of the park, and the fryer fragrance of the Chief Burger. Amid the gridlocked traffic, boys swung cannisters of holy smoke, and older men hawked wares. One of the wares was dolls. The dollmonger carried dozens of them, a towering bouquet of dolls, each blue-eyed and blond-haired, dressed in pink and affecting an erotically ruminative expression. I followed him until he vanished into the fecal particulate hanging in the headlights like a fog.</p><p>Soon I reached the river, the bazaar. Here I felt as I often had: that I could move among the buyers and sellers, the teen-agers perusing defunct American military gear, without attracting their attention. But, then, you always felt you could, didn’t you, until you discovered that no, actually, you never could? A friend of mine, a local reporter, was once hired by a visiting documentarian as a fixer and translator. This documentarian was enchanted by Afghanistan—within a week, enchanted. One day, she told my friend that she wanted to film some B-roll at the bazaar. She needed happy, normal Afghans, she explained, living happy, normal lives. My friend was busy and could not accompany her. Against his emphatic advice, the documentarian went alone. She went, she filmed, she laughed with the venders, she ate the mangoes, and she drank the juice. Then, when her memory sticks were full, her bag laden with textiles, she returned to her guesthouse, triumphant. “See?” she said to my friend.</p><p>It was not until a month later, while my friend was transcribing her footage, that he came to the B-roll from that day and saw a man talking on a cell phone. He appeared in almost every frame, following the documentarian from stall to stall. He held the cell phone to his ear, yelling over the din of the crowd. “Yes, she’s here alone,” the man yelled. “Yes, she’s American,” he yelled. “No, no one is with<span data-page="page_4"></span> her, I can easily grab her, no problem. Fine, I’ll wait. Call me back when they decide.”</p><p>By the time I reached the end of the bazaar, several children were tugging on my sleeve. Although I still couldn’t hear, I knew what they were saying. They were saying, “One dollar!” and “Hey, fuck you!” I tried to shoo them. A boy in a soiled tracksuit flopped to the ground. His legs flailed; spit bubbled on his lips. I increased my pace, practically jogging into the lightless neighborhoods below the mountain.</p><p>The labyrinth of alleys sloped up the foothills, and the mud-mortar homes became denser, muddier, as the grade grew steeper. I found myself at the bottom of an earthen staircase hacked into the cliffside. The stairs ascended precipitously, disappearing into more crowded dwellings. Several steps above me, a dog squatted. I knew that dog. It had the same glistening bald patches, the same cantaloupe-size tumor hanging down between its haunches. Well, they all did. The tumor was so large that it bumped against the steps as the dog limped painfully up them.</p><p>I followed. In places, the stairs more nearly resembled a ladder. The boulders and crags through which they had been carved were marked with paint by de-miners. But “clear” or “not clear”? The marks were illegible—to me, in any case. Homes of I.D.P.s stood improbably amid the sheer escarpments, and their sullage trickled down the stairs, making them slippery. At some point the air changed. I felt the difference in my lungs, which welcomed rather than cringed at each inhalation. I looked back. The dim city lay far below. I was gazing down on that foul soup, putrefying in the basin of the Hindu Kush.</p><p>I suppose that that must have been when I saw them, the birds. They banked in unison, right at eye level, perfectly synchronized, showing the white undersides of their wings, the dark tops. They swooped down the mountain, over the hovels, the city, the bazaar. Then they came soaring back, riding an updraft with an exquisite minimum of effort. As the flock passed overhead, I realized that my hearing had returned. I detected what I thought were bells: yes, bells—a tinny music that seemed to harmonize with the flight of the birds.</p><p>I don’t know how long I watched and listened to them. It was a while, anyway, before I spotted the elderly man standing on the roof of a house, conducting them. There’s no other word for it: he was conducting those birds. He even had a baton-like instrument—a horsewhip or something—with tassels hanging from its tip. He flourished the instrument, and to each movement the birds responded, banking toward him, or away. When, in a crisp, martial motion, he brought the tassels down against his thigh, the flock collapsed upon the roof, as if sucked down a drain.</p><p>The man’s house stood across the moonscape mountainside. I scrabbled over the painted boulders and the loose, eroding shale. When I arrived, I found that the house, too, was constructed of boulders and loose, eroding shale. I knocked on the door. It opened. The man held a bird in each fist. They were pigeons, I saw, and attached with wire to their ankles were miniature silver bells.</p><p>The man possessed magnificent eyebrows, which projected straight out of his face and then curved upward, like saplings that sprout from a bluff and yearn for the sun. He spoke to me. My hearing was almost entirely restored—but of course, like the documentarian, I was deaf. I always had been.</p><p>The old man seemed to get that I was in some sort of trouble. He stepped back into his house and gestured with one of the pigeons for me to enter. I removed my shoes and followed him into a small room filled with cushions. The sole illumination came from a vase of flowers plugged into an electrical outlet. The flowers were a lamp. At the end of each artificial stem, translucent petals enveloped a magenta light. The man opened his hands, and the pigeons fluttered loose, beating their wings across the small, magenta room and out the door, returning to their coop.</p><p>The man was staring at my chest. I looked and saw that my shirt had blood on it. Quite a lot of blood. The man’s eyebrows professed concern.</p><p>“There was an attack,” I said. I pointed down the mountain. “Down there.” I pressed my hands together, as if in prayer, and pulled them apart in a reverse clap. “Boom,” I said.</p><p>“Boom?” the man said.</p><p>“Boom,” I said. Finally, we understood each other.</p><p>The old man invited me to lie down on one of the cushions, and as soon as I did fatigue overtook me. I don’t know how long I was out. It felt like seconds; it might have been centuries. Anyway, enough time passed for everything to have changed. When I woke, I saw right away that I never should have gone to sleep; I’d made a terrible mistake in trusting the old man.</p><p>The agents stood over me, whispering to one another. Two of them had on the black paramilitary uniforms and combat boots of the National Directorate of Security, and between them towered a third man, in slacks, a blue blazer, and a white oxford shirt. Under the blazer he wore a<span data-page="page_5"></span> leather shoulder holster with the handgrip of a pistol sticking out.</p><p>When they saw that I was awake they stopped talking. The two uniformed agents bent down, each grabbing me under an arm, and roughly hauled me to my feet. The plainclothes agent regarded me.</p><p>“Passport,” he said.</p><p>I reached into the pocket where I normally kept it. I smiled apologetically. “I’m very sorry,” I said, “I seem to have—”</p><p>“No passport?” the agent said.</p><p>He took a deep breath through his nose, such a breath that he seemed to increase in height by several inches. Then he grabbed a handful of my shirt, violently twisted it around his fist, and held it up before my eyes, showing me the blood. He shouted furiously into my face words I couldn’t understand but whose meaning I could guess.</p><p>I started to explain. Before I got very far, the agent reared back and with the hand that was not wrapped in my shirt slapped me so hard that I could taste his palm, a mixture of sweat and Purell, in the back of my throat.</p><p>“If you’ll allow me to—”</p><p>Again he slapped me. This time the tone returned, accompanied by lights. I slackened my jaw, trying to pop my ears. When my vision cleared I glimpsed, for the first time, the old man standing behind the agents. I looked at him imploringly, silently entreating him to intervene. To my horror, however, I discovered that the eyebrows did not in fact profess concern, that they had never professed concern, that that had just been wishful thinking on my part.</p><p>It turned out that there was a road behind the house. A HiLux was parked on it. The two uniformed agents handcuffed me and stuffed me in the back. We headed down the mountain. The uniformed agents rode in the bed while the plainclothes agent drove. In the city, there were a lot of checkpoints, more than usual. Each time we approached one, a policeman would peer into the cab of the HiLux, recognize the plainclothes agent, stiffen, and wave us through.</p><p>We turned onto a narrow lane hemmed in on both sides by sandbags and blast wall. Toward the end of the lane, we had to zig and zag to maneuver past staggered barriers. At a gate, a policeman peered into the HiLux, recognized the plainclothes agent, stiffened, and waved us through.</p><p>I was guided by the uniformed agents into a bleak institutional tower, down a hall, down a flight of stairs, down another hall, and into a poorly lit room. The door slammed and a bolt clacked into place. The room was square, concrete, furnished with a metal table and two metal chairs. I knew this room. No, I’d never actually been inside it—I had never dreamed that I would!—but I knew it.</p><p>“I’m an American,” I heard myself say. The words echoed: <em>I’m an American, I’m an American.</em> Later, in a feebler voice, trying to avoid the echo, I heard myself add, “I’m a journalist.”</p><p>The door opened, and the plainclothes agent strode in. He carried a bulky accordion folder under his arm. He set the folder on the table, undid the elastic band, and reached inside. He extracted a Ziploc bag pinched between his thumb and forefinger, opened it, and withdrew a U.S. passport. He slid the passport across the table, inviting me, I gathered, to have a look.</p><p>It was mine, of course. They must have found it at the restaurant. I began to explain. The agent walked around the table and slapped me in the face.</p><p>The next thing he pulled out of the accordion folder and slid across the table was a document too thick for staples, in Dari or Pashto, I had no idea which. Then he pulled out a fountain pen, unscrewed the top, and slid that over, too.</p><p>I flipped to the last page of the document and signed it. The agent wasn’t satisfied. He leaned forward and tapped the bottom right corner of the top page. Then he turned to the second page and did the same. I understood that he wished me to initial each one. It took a long time. First I had trouble getting the hang of the fountain pen; then, midway through, my hand began to cramp. I had to set the pen down and try to shake out the cramp, which was awkward with the handcuffs. The agent grew impatient. When he stood up and walked over to my side of the table, I flinched and cowered, anticipating the blow. Instead of slapping me, however, he took my hand in both of his and gently but firmly massaged my palm with his callused thumbs. That helped a lot, and soon I was initialling again.</p><p>How I wish I could say that it felt good to confess! I’d taken so much from these people, their country, this war. I’d taken and taken. Still, it didn’t feel good. It felt false.</p><p>Once I’d initialled all the pages, the agent picked up the stack, shuffled it into line, and returned it to the folder. He left the room without a word, and his two colleagues entered. They escorted me down the hall, up the flight of stairs, down the other hall, and out of the building. One of them removed my handcuffs and gave me my passport. The<span data-page="page_final"></span> other pointed at the gate.</p><p>I was so exhausted and demoralized that I paid little attention to where I was going. I stumbled through the park, past the Chief Burger and the toy stores. At one point, I crossed paths with a pack of street kids. I must not have looked too hot: they regarded me dubiously, uncertain whether to beg.</p><p>When I reached the mosque, one of the cobblers sitting on the sidewalk pointed at my feet. I’d been barefoot ever since the agents had whisked me away from the pigeon conductor. With the cobbler pointing and laughing and his fellow-cobblers starting to join in and pedestrians stopping to see and cars slowing down and mullahs and would-be mullahs frowning at me from the ablution area, I was visited by a familiar embarrassment.</p><p>The cobbler held up a pair of sandals, offering them to me. I pulled my pockets inside out to show him that they were empty. He waved the sandals, insisting that I take them anyway. I was choked with gratitude; I nearly wept. I struggled to summon the words while the cobbler waited to receive them.</p><p>That’s when I saw the man talking on his cell phone.</p><p>“No, no one is with him, I can easily grab him,” the man was saying.</p><p>Or was he? I didn’t know. I still don’t. ♦</p>	Luke Mogelson	February 29, 2016 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/02/29/total-solar	Afghanistan	Books	Cranes	Death	Journalists	Middle East	Unnamed	First	Death
You Are Happy?	<p>“Break her arms, break her legs,” Lakshman’s grandmother would say about her daughter-in-law, “then see how she crawls to her bottle.” What she said made sense. Lakshman’s father refused to beat his wife, though. “This is America,” he said. “I will go to jail and you will be sitting in India eating warm pakoras.” To Lakshman, it seemed unmanly of his father not to take charge.</p><p>It happened every time the family went to a party. Before they left the house, his father would wipe down his comb. He would tuck a handkerchief into his pants pocket. He would get out the notebook in which he had written down the lyrics of movie songs, because he liked to sing and hoped that somebody would ask him to.</p><p>The parties were segregated: there was the kitchen, where the women gathered, and there was the living room, where the men stood and talked about politics, investments. Lakshman’s mother was thirty-two, short, stocky, curly-haired. She would stir up trouble. Even when she said ordinary things, she sounded as if she doubted they were true. “You are happy?” she’d say to a woman as if the woman were overlooking something. The surprised person would then feel that she had to defend her happiness. The other women in the kitchen were not used to this kind of behavior. They would grow quiet and look at Lakshman’s mother as she stood silently, appearing pleased, and sipping her Scotch. The fact that his mother drank was itself unusual. Perhaps she did it to be different from the other women; perhaps she wanted to be like a man and therefore more important. When she’d got a little bit drunk, she’d go into the living room and stand among the men, drinking from a small glass and talking about stocks and the World Bank. The men treated her with condescension and irritation, not so much because she was a woman as because she was a woman pretending to know things that she did not know, and vanity and foolishness, which were tolerable in a man, were not tolerable in a woman.</p><p>Lakshman’s mother had begun drinking when he was eight. This was around the time that they’d been sent to America by his father’s parents, to expand the family’s export business. From the very start, she had behaved differently with alcohol than other people did. At most parties, tea and juice were offered first and alcohol was an afterthought. At Lakshman’s parents’ parties, his mother was the one who offered drinks. She pressed alcohol on whoever entered the house. “Whiskey, bourbon, wine,” she’d say, smoothing each word. “Tea, Coca-Cola is also there.” Sometimes the men who came over would praise her for her drinking or talk about their own, how it was only during the third drink that they began to feel happy. Whenever a man praised his mother for her drinking, Lakshman became anxious. Because of the movies he’d seen, he sensed danger when he spotted his drunken mother talking to a man. Instead of joining the other children in the basement, boys and girls his age who were running and playing and shrieking, delighted to be allowed to stay up late, he’d follow his mother around the house. Keeping an eye on her made him feel safer but also prolonged his anxiety. By the end of the night he’d be so exhausted that he wanted to cry.</p><p>The drinking overtook her quickly. By the time Lakshman was nine, she was drinking during dinner. His father, who rarely drank, protested. “Every night you have to drink?”</p><p>“I can’t have a little happiness? Is there something wrong with me that I must suffer?”</p><p>When Lakshman was eleven, she started drinking during the day. His parents’ marriage had been arranged by their parents, who did business together, and his mother and father had never really liked each other. Around that time, they stopped sleeping in the same room. To the extent that they spoke at all, it was either in shouts or in sarcasm. “Do you know what kind of people drink during the day?” his father said, shaking a finger at her. “Drunkards. You are a drunkard.”</p><p>Lakshman, coming home from school, would sniff the air near his mother to confirm what he could tell with his eyes. If she was drunk, she seemed hollow, as if she were directing her body from afar.</p><p>Lakshman’s family’s life seemed strange to him, his father mostly ignoring his mother, often refusing to be with her, getting up from the kitchen table and leaving the room when she came in.</p><p>When Lakshman was thirteen and about to graduate from eighth grade, his mother’s kidneys began to hurt. He would come home and find her standing in the kitchen, holding an ice pack against her side. The fact that she cared so little about herself seemed to indicate that she cared nothing for him or his father. He wanted to mock her and shout at her, but he was afraid that she would hit him.</p><p>His mother did occasionally try to change. Once, she went to a doctor, and though she probably lied about how much she drank, the doctor still urged her to go to Alcoholics Anonymous. She went to A.A. meetings for a week or two, then stopped.</p><p>In the past, Lakshman’s<span data-page="page_2"></span> father had travelled to India four or five times a year. As Lakshman’s mother’s drinking worsened, he began going more often. Lakshman felt strange being alone at home with his mother, sitting at the kitchen table, doing his homework, while his mother drank upstairs. The silence in the house was so intense it hummed.</p><p>When Lakshman was fourteen and his father was in India on one of his business trips, his mother decided that she was going to stay in bed and drink.</p><p>Her room was large and had a cream-colored carpet and a king-size bed. There was a picture window behind the bed and, to the side of the room, another window, which looked out onto a neighbor’s roof. Lakshman stood in the doorway and watched his mother’s preparations. She seemed cheerful as she moved around the room. She opened the windows completely, although it was winter. She put two cases of wine on the carpeted floor beside the bed. She put several jugs of water on the carpet, too, and, by the head of the bed, a white plastic bucket to vomit into.</p><p>“Daddy won’t like this,” Lakshman murmured.</p><p>“Let him die,” she replied happily. She put some large bags of potato chips on the nightstand. Lakshman, watching his mother, felt that what she was planning was so bizarre that it could not possibly happen. With the windows open, the room quickly became icy. His mother got under the quilt and picked up a glass of white wine.</p><p>The next day, Lakshman telephoned India. He gripped the phone and spoke in a soft, tight voice. “Mommy says she is going to stay in bed and drink.” Even as he was speaking, he knew that his father would find some way to make light of what was happening. His father said, “What else does she do anyway?” Lakshman repeated what he had said, that his mother had got into bed and had been drinking for twenty-four hours. He felt detached from himself, like when he was taking a difficult math test and he was frightened but his pencil began to hop over the sheet of paper on its own, writing numbers.</p><p>His father didn’t say anything. Lakshman knew the silence meant that his father could later pretend that what he had said had not been said. He repeated it for a third time. “What can be done?” his father answered in irritation.</p><p>For her first day or two in bed, Lakshman’s mother sipped from a wineglass and ate potato chips and smiled confusedly at the TV playing in a corner. When she had to, she got up and stumbled to the bathroom at the end of the hall near his father’s room. After a few days, though, she began shitting and pissing in the bucket.</p><p>Because of Lakshman’s calls, his father flew back. He stood in the bedroom doorway and screamed, “Die! At last there is nothing else to do!” He shouted this, but he also phoned the county’s central A.A. office.</p><p>Two women came to the front door of the house and rang the bell. One was blond and short and looked to be in her early twenties. The other was much older and had very white, dusty-looking skin. Lakshman’s father, unshaven, exhausted from the eleven-hour flight from Delhi, and so dazed that he had a slipper on one foot while the other was bare, asked them to come in. Before entering, the women stood on the cement porch in front of the open door and prayed. They held hands and bowed their heads.</p><p>The older woman walked in first. As she passed Lakshman and his father, she mentioned that she liked Indian food. They went up the stairs. His mother’s room was at the end of the hall and its white wooden door was closed.</p><p>When they pushed it open, the room was freezing and full of light. To Lakshman, the light seemed unearthly, as if they were all above the clouds, where it wasn’t possible to survive. There was the light and there was the stench. The smell of vomit, urine, and shit was such that it seemed unthinkable that a human being ate there, slept there.</p><p>“You want to go to a detox?” the older woman asked Lakshman’s mother. His mother was half-sitting, with her head against the headboard. She appeared stupefied. On her chin and down the front of her purple kameez were strings of dried vomit. It was embarrassing to have strangers see his mother this way. But he also felt a thin, eager hope that these two women could fix her, that they were capable of doing something simple that would suddenly make everything all right.</p><p>The young woman picked up the bucket. Leaning to one side, she passed Lakshman and his father by the doorway and took it down the hall to the bathroom.</p><p>“If you don’t go to a detox, you are going to die,” the older woman said. She spoke loudly and clearly.</p><p>The two women helped his mother stand. They held her on both sides and walked her down the hall. She was not wearing the pajama bottom under her long shirt, and to see her yellow, hairy legs was awful. In the bathroom, she stepped into the tub with her kameez still on.</p><p>The women had come in a blue minivan and they drove her to a<span data-page="page_3"></span> detox center. Lakshman and his father followed in the family’s Toyota, with Lakshman clutching his mother’s passport and insurance card. He wondered what a detox facility looked like. He imagined that it resembled a grand bank.</p><p>It was a bright Sunday morning. They took surface roads so that the two vehicles wouldn’t lose track of each other. The stores they passed were closed and their windows flashed sun. Lakshman began to feel relief. The flashes of light were like blasts of music. The occasional person crossing a road seemed like a sign that life was going on, that life was always going to go on, and so somewhere there was the possibility of things being different and happiness existing.</p><p>In India, on farms, pretty young women are as common as rabbits. It is easy to have sex with girls who are fifteen, sixteen, seventeen. These girls have nothing to trade other than sex and physical labor, and often they are raped. On farms, if a girl goes into the fields in the early morning to defecate there is a strong chance that she will be assaulted.</p><p>Lakshman had been going back to India every summer since he came to America. When he was there, he went with his uncles to the farm that his father’s family owned. He liked the farm, liked throwing rocks into a field, causing grasshoppers to shoot up by the dozen. He liked the step well, walking down it to take a bath, the temperature dropping, the air turning sweet, and then squatting on the bottom step and splashing a bucket in the water to clear the tadpoles and weeds, before beginning to soap himself.</p><p>On the farm, each uncle had his favorite girl. The girls would bring his uncles tea in the morning and then disappear into their rooms for a half hour or more. Usually, only the men of the family went to the farm. A few times a year, for religious events at particular temples, the women of the family also came. These wives, aunts, and daughters screamed at the girls and chased them with sticks, and the farm girls urinated in the buckets of water used to wash the family temples. Lakshman did not think about this much. It seemed funny to him, like a television sitcom.</p><p>One summer evening when he was still fourteen, after his mother had gone to the detox center and come back and started drinking again, Lakshman was standing by a sugarcane press near an irrigation channel. A girl who was perhaps nineteen came up to him. She was tall for a villager and barefoot, with a long skirt that had fingernail-size silver bells sewn onto it. Attaching a “<em>ji</em>” to his name, as though he were the older one, she asked him in their regional dialect what months it rained in America. She asked this almost as if she had already heard the answer and wanted to confirm that she wasn’t being lied to. “Every month,” Lakshman said. “Every month it rains.”</p><p>“Does ice fall, too?”</p><p>“In winter.”</p><p>“I had heard that,” the girl said mysteriously and then stood there for a moment as if she wanted to be remembered. She had a beautiful oval face and small breasts, and she appeared very confident.</p><p>The next day the girl came up to Lakshman again. This time it was early morning and his father’s oldest brother, bald and with a mustache, was standing nearby chewing a tooth-cleaning twig. She thrust a little knotted rag into Lakshman’s hand. “Some sweets,” she said and stared at him again. “How many air-conditioners does your house have?”</p><p>“Run, girl,” his uncle said quietly. “There is nobody here for you.”</p><p>Later, Lakshman would think that it was probably falling in love with this girl that had caused his father to decide to have Lakshman’s mother murdered. There was nothing else to explain the change. His mother was no different from how she had been for years, drunk—quietly drunk sometimes, alarmingly erratic at others. So there must have been something about falling in love that had made his father think that life was short and he should not stay with this woman who appeared to care about no one.</p><p>At the time, though, all Lakshman knew was that something had changed for his father. His father’s room was next to his. Sometimes Lakshman would be awakened at two or three in the morning by the sound of his father on the phone. His father would be laughing in a cheerful, relaxed way, and when he spoke he used their regional dialect. Lakshman’s uncles in India gave their girls phones, and he guessed that his father had done the same. Now, during the day, his father was more laid-back. The anger that had lived beneath his voice vanished. This was a relief, but his not being unhappy also felt like a betrayal to Lakshman.</p><p>One fall afternoon when everything smelled wet, Lakshman came home from school and had to turn on the kitchen lights, although it was only four o’clock. The house was quiet, except for the soft sound of the TV in his mother’s room, where she was probably drinking. He saw that the answering-machine light was blinking red. He pressed Play and there it was, the young woman’s voice. “Listen,” she said, and then there was<span data-page="page_4"></span> some splashing. “That is my feet in water.” She laughed and hung up. Lakshman was furious. It was vulgar for her to leave a message. And she was a farm girl. She should know her place. He deleted the message. As soon as he did, he became scared that his father would find out.</p><p>To have an alcoholic woman murdered, her husband must send her to her parents and tell them that she is a drunkard and not to be trusted and that he does not want her back. Until he does this, she is under his protection and she won’t be killed, because she belongs to his family and not to her father’s. But, once she is returned in this way, her family will kill her, because the shame of having a daughter or a sister who’s an alcoholic is staggering. It is even worse than having one who is promiscuous. With a promiscuous woman, you know to kill her right away; with an alcoholic, the shame lasts longer because you hesitate.</p><p>Lakshman did not understand what was going on, other than that his father seemed to be in love with a farm girl and was complaining more than usual. He started calling Lakshman’s grandmother. “What kind of life is this?” he would ask. “What did you do to me when you got me a wife like this?” Much later, Lakshman understood that his grandmother had to be consulted because, since his mother belonged to a family with which his father’s family did business, there would be financial consequences if his mother was sent back.</p><p>He sensed that there was a crisis building. His mother rarely went to India. Nobody wanted her there, and so she went only if a close relative was getting married and even then only for a week or two. But now his other grandmother, the one on his mother’s side, began calling, too. She wheedled Lakshman’s mother, pressing her to visit, even though there was no wedding coming up.</p><p>It was strange to hear his grandmother’s voice on the phone. “Baby boy, go get your mother,” his grandmother would say when he picked up. Calls and more calls added to a sense of eeriness. It seemed to Lakshman that something was being worked out but that his mother was too drunk to realize that the situation around her was changing.</p><p>Talking to her mother made Lakshman’s mother giddy. Sometimes, after a call, she would stay downstairs and eat regular food, instead of going back to her room and drinking wine and eating potato chips. Lakshman would then get nostalgic for the time when she drank only at parties.</p><p>About two months after Lakshman’s maternal grandmother began calling, his mother left for India. Three days after that, barely enough time for her to land in Delhi, take the plane to Jaipur, and unpack, Lakshman was standing at the stove making tea when his father came into the kitchen and said, “Your mother has died of dengue. She died in a hospital last night.”</p><p>Lakshman felt as if he were dreaming. He didn’t turn off the stove, as tradition required after a death. Instead, he continued making tea. His father had a round, dark face and he stared at Lakshman nervously, as if waiting to see if he would be believed.</p><p>“Your mother died last night,” he repeated.</p><p>“In reality?” Lakshman asked.</p><p>“Yes. In reality.” His father opened the refrigerator and took out a carton of eggs.</p><p>Lakshman felt a sense of relief. It was as if he had come into a room that had been crowded with furniture but now stood empty. The space seemed smaller and plainer, but also less stressful. He didn’t feel sadness, at first, because a part of him didn’t believe that his mother was dead. If she were dead, he thought, they wouldn’t be preparing food. It would be improper to do so.</p><p>He went to school. He didn’t tell anyone what his father had said. After classes, he attended track practice. Running in the cold moist air, he remembered when his mother had come back from her first detox, the one that the two women from A.A. had taken her to. She had been gone for four weeks. She returned home at eleven in the morning, and that afternoon she and he and his father went for a walk. Their street did not have sidewalks, so they walked on the road itself, the snow squeaking under their feet, the trees in the yards dark with moisture. “Manuji,” his mother said to his father with a bashful half smile. “I am not going to drink. I don’t know why, but I am certain.” Her eyes were inwardly focussed, as if she were looking at something within that comforted her and gave her confidence. His father listened but did not speak. He walked with his head down, and he appeared frustrated, as if he knew he was being lied to and yet could not protest the lie.</p><p>Lakshman remembered this and remembered when his mother had had two black eyes because she had fallen down the stairs. The black eyes made her look vulnerable and young. He remembered also when his mother had taken his father around the house and shown him where she had hidden bottles of alcohol. She had stood watching as his father<span data-page="page_5"></span> put the bottles in a trash can and she had shaken her hands as if they were on fire and she was trying to put them out. As Lakshman ran, tears slid down his face.</p><p>That night he lay awake listening, but his father did not talk on the phone to his lover. The next night he did, quietly. And the third night he was laughing as he always had. Lakshman was revolted by him.</p><p>Weeks passed. The door to his mother’s room remained closed. They told no one of her death. By this time in America they had stopped socializing, so people knew them only tangentially and there were few to tell. Finally, his father informed an acquaintance or two and somehow the news got to school. There Lakshman was pulled out of class by his guidance counsellor and asked how he was doing. Talking to a white person in authority was frightening, and Lakshman said he was fine.</p><p>After perhaps a month, his father opened the door to his mother’s room. In keeping with tradition, all the linens and clothes were going to be thrown away. Lakshman stood in his mother’s room as his father opened the drawers and dumped the red, gold, and peacock saris into black garbage bags. “I miss Mommy,” Lakshman said.</p><p>“You should. She was your mother.” His father studied him for a moment before returning to work.</p><p>“Do you miss her?”</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>Later, the garbage bags sat slumped at the end of the driveway. It rained before the garbagemen came, and the creases on the bags filled with water.</p><p>When Lakshman went to India the summer after his mother’s death, his father’s family complained regularly about not receiving help from his mother’s relatives. He still did not understand that his mother had been murdered and, to him, her family’s no longer helping meant a fraying of relations and reminded him that his mother was dead.</p><p>“Just because Aarti is gone shouldn’t mean the relationship is finished,” his grandmother said. “These relationships go from generation to generation.”</p><p>“What can one do with a family that raises a drunk?” his father’s second-oldest brother, skinny and with a scraggly beard, answered. “They are all crazy.”</p><p>“They are not so crazy when it comes to their own interests,” his grandmother spat in the weird conspiratorial way that she sometimes spoke.</p><p>Often, these conversations occurred in the afternoon, after the family woke from the midday nap. They would all be groggy and irritable, and their words were like the bitterness in their mouths.</p><p>For a while, Lakshman’s uncle, the second-oldest brother, tried hinting at what had happened. “They are scary people. Nobody owns seventy trucks without committing crimes,” he told Lakshman. Late in the summer, Lakshman realized what his uncle was suggesting. But his grandmother and his uncle often said strange accusatory things. They complained that the local milkman diluted his milk with water, and that once there had been a fish in the milk. It was hard, therefore, to take what his uncle said seriously.</p><p>“Who dies from dengue after one day?” his uncle insisted one afternoon.</p><p>“Keep quiet, idiot,” Lakshman’s grandmother said.</p><p>In Jaipur at the start of summer, he had visited his mother’s family, and his grandmother on that side had grabbed him and hugged him tightly and sobbed. He could recall the exact sensation of his grandmother’s arms around him, the boniness of her chest, the sharpness of her arms. All this seemed to cut through his uncle’s hinted accusations.</p><p>But slowly, as the weeks passed and the monsoon came and people ran laughing through the streets and then God Krishna’s birthday arrived, a nervousness overtook Lakshman. He started to have a hard time sleeping at night. The street dogs barking at two or three in the morning would wake him and he would become wild with panic. His grandmother’s sighing as she made her way to the toilet through the darkened house would pitch him into misery.</p><p>He went to the farm as he always did. Some Gypsies were passing through the area, and at night there were puppet shows and men singing in front of the main house. In the morning, there were the girls visiting his uncles. Once, he was walking through a field and he thought he saw the girl his father loved, sitting beneath a tree talking to another girl. He walked toward her in the shimmering heat. As he did, the girl got up quickly and hurried away. Later that day, he asked the farm manager about the girl and the man said that he would have her called. Lakshman told the man no and headed back to the house. As he did, as he crossed the yellowed grass, sadness filled him. It seemed awful that his mother had died, that his father seemed to have forgotten her, that this girl was still living her life.</p><p>That night, he couldn’t sleep at all. The crickets were screaming, and he sat up in bed and thought of his mother and how on her nightstand she sometimes had books from A.A., how when she was going into a detox center she’d become frightened at the thought of being away from home and start crying, how for a while she had continued to phone the old white woman with the dusty skin who had taken her to the first<span data-page="page_final"></span> detox.</p><p>Around four, the crows started cawing, and soon the smaller birds were chattering, as if they had dreams they were eager to share. At five, the girls arrived on the veranda, their bare feet going past his room and teacups rattling on saucers. Lakshman sat and listened and felt certain that he would never come back to the farm again, that whatever happened he could never come back. ♦</p>	Akhil Sharma	April 17, 2017 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/17/you-are-happy	Death	India					Lakshman	Third	Death
The Secret Goldfish	<p>He <span data-page="page_1"></span>had a weird growth along his dorsal fin, and that gape-mouth grimace you see in older fish. Way too big for his tank, too, having outgrown the standard goldfish age limit. Which is what? About one month? He was six years old—outlandishly old for a fish. One afternoon, Teddy, as he was called then, now just Ted, took notice of the condition of Fish’s tank: a wedge of sunlight plunged through the window of his bedroom and struck the water’s surface, disappearing. The water was so clotted it had become a solid mass, a putty within which Fish was presumably swimming, or dead. Most likely dead. Where’s Fish? Where’s Fish? Teddy yelled to his mom. She came into his room, caught sight of the tank, and gave a small yelp. Once again, a fish had been neglected.</p><p>Everyone knows the story. The kids beg and plead: Please, please get us a fish (or a dog), we’ll feed it, we will, honest, we’ll take care of it and you won’t have to do a single thing. We’ll clean the tank walls with the brush and make sure the filter charcoal is replaced regularly and refill the water when it evaporates. Please, please, we can handle it, we’re old enough now, we are, it’ll be so much fun, it will, so much fun. But in the end they don’t. They dump too much food in no matter how often they’re told to be careful, to use just a pinch, and even after they’ve read Biblical-sounding fables about the fish who ate too much and grew too large for its bowl, shattering the sides, they watch gleefully while he consumes like mad, unable to stop. It’s fun to watch him eat, to witness the physical manifestation of a fact: the level of Fish’s hunger is permanently set to high. In the metaphysics of the fish universe, gluttony is not a sin. The delicate wafers of food fall lightly onto the water, linger on the surface tension, and are broken apart on infinitely eager lips. She overfeeds, too (on the days when she’s pretty sure the kids haven’t fed him). Her shaking mechanics are sloppy. The light flakes become moist, collude, collect their inertia, and all too often fall out of the can in a large clump. Really, she hasn’t neglected the poor fish. “Neglect” seems a word too heavy with submerged intent. Something was bound to slip to the side amid the chaos of the domestic arena. But Fish has sustained himself in terrible conditions. He is the king of all goldfish survivors.</p><p>Her own childhood goldfish—named Fred—ended his days in Grayling Pond, a hole near her house in northern Michigan, dug out by the state D.N.R. on a pond-production grant. (Why the Great Lakes state needed more ponds is anyone’s guess.) Garnished with a wide band of lily pads, the water a pale yellow, speckled with skeeter-bug ripples, the pond was close to becoming a marsh. Hope you survive, Fred, her father had said as he slopped the fish out of the pail and into the pond. She did not forget the sight of her beloved fish as he slipped from the lip of the bucket and rode the glassine tube of water into the pond. The rest of the summer she imagined his orange form—brilliantly bright and fluorescent against the glimmer of water—in a kind of slow-motion replay. Dumbest animals on earth, she remembered her father adding. Nothing dumber than a carp. Except maybe a catfish, or your goddam mother.</p><p>Not long after that afternoon at Grayling Pond, her father left the house in a fit of rage. Gone for good, her mother said. Thank Christ. Then, a few months later, he was killed in a freak accident, crushed between hunks of ice and the hull of a container ship in Duluth. Superior’s slush ice was temperamental that winter, chewing up the coastline, damaging bulkheads. Her father had signed on as one of the men who went down with poles and gave furtive pokes and prods, in the tradition of those Michigan rivermen who had once dislodged logjams with their peaveys and pike poles, standing atop the timber in their spiked boots, sparring with magnificent forces. Accounts varied, but the basic story was that the ice shifted, some kind of crevasse formed, and he slipped in. Then the lake gave a heave and his legs were crushed, clamped in the jaw of God’s stupid justice. As she liked to imagine it, he had just enough time to piece together a little prayer asking for forgiveness for being a failure of a father (“Dear Heavenly Father, forgive me for my huge failings as a father to my dear daughter and even more for my gaping failure as a husband to my wife”) and for dumping Fred (“and for getting rid of that fish my daughter loved more than me”), and then to watch as the pale winter sun slipped quickly away while the other men urged him to remain calm and told him that he’d be fine and they’d have him out in a minute or so, while knowing for certain that they wouldn’t.</p><p>Long after her father was gone, she imagined Fred lurking in the lower reaches of Grayling Pond, in the coolest pockets, trying to conserve his energy. Sometimes, when she was cleaning upstairs and dusting<span data-page="page_2"></span> Teddy’s room, she would pause in the deep, warm, silent heart of a suburban afternoon and watch Fish as he dangled asleep, wide-eyed, unmoving, just fluffing his fins softly on occasion. One time she even tried it herself, standing still, suspended in the dense fluid of an unending array of demanding tasks—cleaning, cooking, washing, grocery shopping, snack-getting—while outside the birds chirped and the traffic hissed past on the parkway.</p><p>The marriage had fallen apart abruptly. Her husband—who worked in the city as a corporate banker and left the house each morning at dawn with the <em>Times</em>, still wrapped in its bright-blue delivery bag, tucked beneath his arm—had betrayed his vows. One evening, he’d arrived home from work with what seemed to be a new face: his teeth were abnormally white. He’d had them bleached in the city. (In retrospect, she saw that his bright teeth were the first hint of his infidelity.) He had found a dentist on Park Avenue. Soon he was coming home late on some nights and not at all on others, under the vague pretense of work obligations. In Japan, he explained, people sleep overnight in town as a sign of their dedication to business; they rent cubicles just wide enough for a body, like coffins, he said, and for days when he did not return she thought of those small compartments and she chose to believe him. (Of course I know about the Japanese, she had said, emphatically.) Then one night she found him in the bathroom with a bar of soap, rubbing it gently against his wedding ring. It’s too tight, he said. I’m just trying to loosen it. When others were perplexed by the fact that she had not deduced his infidelity, picked up on the clues, during those fall months, she felt compelled (though she never did) to describe the marriage in all of its long complexity—fifteen years—starting with the honeymoon in Spain: the parador in Chinchón, outside Madrid, that had once been a monastery, standing naked with him at the balcony door in the dusky night air listening to the sounds of the village and the splash of the pool. She had given up her career for the relationship, for the family. She had given up plenty in order to stay home for Teddy’s and Annie’s formative years, to make sure those brain synapses formed correctly, to be assured that the right connections were fused. (Because studies had made it clear that a kid’s success depends on the first few years. It was important to develop the fine motor skills, to have the appropriate hand play, not to mention critical reasoning skills, before the age of four!) So, yes, she guessed the whole decision to give herself over to the domestic job had been an act of free will, but now it felt as though the act itself had been carried out in the conditions of betrayal that would eventually unfold before her.</p><p>Fish had come into the family fold in a plastic Baggie of water, bulging dangerously, knotted at the top, with a mate, Sammy, who would end up a floater two days later. Pet Universe had given free goldfish to all the kids on a preschool field trip. In less than a year, Fish had grown too big for his starter bowl and begun to tighten his spiralled laps, restricted in his movements by his gathering bulk and the glass walls of the bowl. Then he graduated to a classic five-gallon bowl, where, in the course of the next few years, he grew, until one afternoon, still deep in what seemed to be a stable domestic situation, with the kids off at school, she went out to Pet Universe and found a large tank and some water-prep drops and a filter unit, one that sat on the rim and produced a sleek, fountainlike curl of water, and some turquoise gravel and a small figurine to keep the fish company: a cartoonish pirate galleon—a combination of Mark Twain riverboat and man-of-war—with an exaggerated bow and an orange plastic paddle wheel that spun around in the tank’s currents until it gobbed up and stuck. The figurine, which was meant to please the eyes of children, had that confused mix of design that put commercial viability ahead of the truth. Teddy and Annie hated it. Ultimately, the figure served one purpose. It rearranged the conceptual space of the tank and gave the illusion that Fish now had something to do, something to work around, during his languorous afternoon laps, and she found herself going in to watch him, giving deep philosophical consideration to his actions: Did Fish remember that he had passed that way before? Was he aware of his eternal hell, caught in the tank’s glass grip? Or did he feel wondrously free, swimming—for all he knew—in Lake Superior, an abundant, wide field of water, with some glass obstructions here and there? Was he basically free of wants, needs, and everything else? Did he wonder at the food miraculously appearing atop the surface tension, food to be approached with parted lips?</p><p>One evening, after observing Fish, when she was at the sink looking out the window at the yard, she saw her husband there, along the south side, holding his phone to his ear and lifting his free hand up and down from his waist in a slight flapping<span data-page="page_3"></span> gesture that she knew indicated that he was emotionally agitated.</p><p>Shortly after that, the tank began to murk up. Through the dim months of January and February, the filter clotted, the flow stopped, and stringy green silk grew on the lip of the waterfall. The murk thickened. In the center of the darkness, Fish swam in random patterns and became a sad, hopeless entity curled into his plight. He was no longer fooled by his short-term memory into thinking that he was eternally free. Nor was he bored by the repetitive nature of his laps, going around the stupid ship figurine, sinking down into the gravel, picking—typical bottom-feeder—for scraps. Instead, he was lost in the eternal roar of an isotropic universe, flinging himself wildly within the expanding big bang of tank murk. On occasion, he found his way to the light and rubbed his eye against the glass, peering out in a judgmental way. But no one was there to see him. No one seemed available to witness these outward glances. Until the day when Teddy, now just Ted, noticed and said, Mom, Mom, the tank, and she went and cleaned it, but only after she had knocked her knuckle a few times on the glass and seen that he was alive, consumed in the dark but moving and seemingly healthy. Then she felt awe at the fact that life was sustainable even under the most abhorrent conditions. She felt a fleeting connection between this awe and the possibility that God exists. But then she reminded herself that it was only Fish. Just frickin’ Fish, she thought. Here I am so weepy and sad, trying to make sense of my horrible situation, that something like this will give me hope. Of course, she was probably also thinking back to that afternoon, watching her father sluice Fred down into the warm waters of the shallow pond in Michigan. Her memory of it was profoundly clear. The vision of the fish itself—pristine and orange—travelling through the water as it spilled from the bucket was exact and perfect.</p><p>She set to work scooping out the water with an old Tupperware bowl, replacing it in increments so the chlorine would evaporate, driving to Pet Universe to get another cotton filter, some water-clarifying drops, and a pound sack of activated charcoal nuggets. She disassembled the pump mechanism—a small magnet attached to a ring of plastic that hovered, embraced by a larger magnet. Somehow the larger magnet coöperated with the magnet on the plastic device and used physical laws of some sort to suck the water up and through the filter, where it cascaded over the wide lip and twisted as it approached the surface. It seemed to her as her fingers cleaned the device that it was not only a thing of great simplicity and beauty but also something much deeper, a tool meant to sustain Fish’s life and, in turn, his place in the family. The afternoon was clear, blue-skied, wintry bright—and out the kitchen window she saw the uncut lawn, dark straw brown, matted down in van Gogh swirls, frosted with cold. Past the lawn, the woods, through which she could see the cars moving on the parkway, stood stark and brittle in the direct implications of the winter light. It was a fine scene, embarrassingly suburban, but certainly fine. Back upstairs, she saw Fish swimming jauntily in his new conditions and she was pretty sure that he was delighted, moving with swift strokes from one end of the tank to the other, skirting the figurine professionally, wagging his back fin—what was that called? was it the caudal fin?—fashionably, like a cabaret dancer working her fan. A beautiful tail, unfurling in a windswept motion in the clearing water. When she leaned down for a closer look, it became apparent that the fin was much, much larger than it seemed when it was in action and twining in on itself. When Fish paused, it swayed open beautifully—a fine, healthy, wide carp tail. Along his sides, he had the usual scars of an abused fish, a wound or two, a missing scale, a new, smaller growth of some kind down near his anal fin. But otherwise he seemed big, brutally healthy, still blinking off the shock of the sudden glare.</p><p>Then the tank fell back into its murk, got worse, stank up, and became, well, completely, utterly, fantastically murky. Here one might note tangentially: if, as Aristotle claims, poetry is something of graver import than history—partly because of the naturalness of its statements—then Fish was more important than any domestic history, because Fish was poetic, in that he had succumbed to the darkness that had formed around him, and yet he was unwilling to die—or, rather, he <em>did not</em> die. He kept himself alive. He kept at it. Somehow he gathered enough oxygen from the water—perhaps by staying directly under the trickle that made its way over the lip of the filter. Of course, by nature he was a bottom-feeder, a mudfish, accustomed to slime and algae and to an environment that, for other fish, would be insufferable. No trout could sustain itself in these conditions. Not even close. A good brookie would’ve gone belly up long ago. A brookie would want cool pockets of a fast-moving stream, sweet riffles, bubbling swirls, to live a good life. But Fish stood in his cave of<span data-page="page_4"></span> slime, graver than the history of the household into which his glass enclave had been placed: Dad packing his suitcases, folding and refolding his trousers and taking his ties off the electric tie rack and carefully folding them inside sheets of tissue, and then taking his shoes and putting each pair, highly glossed oxfords (he was one of the few to make regular use of the shoeshine stand at Grand Central), into cotton drawstring sacks, and then emptying his top dresser drawer, taking his cufflinks, his old wallets, and a few other items. All of this stuff, the history of the house, the legal papers signed and sealed and the attendant separation agreement and, of course, the divorce that left her the house—all this historical material was transpiring outside the gist of Fish. He could chart his course and touch each corner of the tank and still not know shit. But he understood something. That much was clear. The world is a mucky mess. It gets clotted up, submerged in its own gunk. End of story.</p><p>He brushed softly against the beard of algae that hung from the filter device, worked his way over to the figurine, leaned his flank against her side, and felt the shift of temperature as night fell—Teddy liked to sleep with the window cracked a bit—and the oxygen content increased slightly as the water cooled. During the day, the sun cranked through the window, the tank grew warm, and he didn’t move at all, unless someone came into the room and knocked on the tank or the floor, and then he jerked forward slightly before quickly settling down. A few times the downstairs door slammed hard enough to jolt him awake. Or there was a smashing sound from the kitchen. Or voices. “What in the world should we do?” “I would most certainly like this to be amicable, for the sake of the kids.” Or a shoe striking the wall in the adjacent master bedroom. At times he felt a kinship with the figurine, as if another carp were there alongside him, waiting, hovering. Other times he felt a slight kinship with the sides of the tank, which touched his gill flaps when he went in search of light. God, if only he knew that he, Fish, was at the very center of the domestic arena, holding court with his own desire to live. He might have died happily right there! But he was not a symbolic fish. He seemed to have no desire to stand as the tragic hero in this drama.</p><p>Sent out, told to stay out, the kids were playing together down in the yard so that, inside, the two central figures, Dad and Mom, might have one final talk. The kids were standing by the playhouse—which itself was falling to decrepitude, dark-gray smears of mildew growing on its fake logs—pretending to be a mom and a dad themselves, although they were a bit too old and self-conscious for playacting. Perhaps they were old enough to know that they were faking it on two levels, regressing to a secondary level of playacting they’d pretty much rejected but playing Mom and Dad anyway, Teddy saying, I’m gonna call my lawyer if you don’t settle with me, and Annie responding, in her high sweet voice, I knew you’d lawyer up on me, I just knew it, and then both kids giggling in that secretive, all-knowing way they have. Overhead, the tree branches were fuzzed with the first buds of spring, but it was still a bit cold, and words hovered in vapor from their mouths and darkness was falling fast over the trees, and beyond the trees the commuter traffic hissed unnoticed.</p><p>If you were heading south on the Merritt Parkway on the afternoon of April 3rd, and you happened to look to your right through the trees after Exit 35, you might’ve seen them, back beyond the old stone piles, the farm fences that no longer held significance except maybe as a reminder of the Robert Frost poem about good fences and good neighbors and all of that: two kids leaning against an old playhouse while the house behind them appeared cozy, warm, and, clearly, expensive. A fleeting tableau without much meaning to the commuting folk aside from the formulaic economics of the matter: near the parkway = reduced value, but an expensive area + buffer of stone walls + old trees + trendiness of area = more value.</p><p>There is something romantic and heartening about seeing those homes through the trees from the vantage of the parkway—those safe, confided Connecticut lives. Inside the house, the secret goldfish is going about his deeply moving predicament, holding his life close to the gills, subdued by the dark but unwilling to relinquish his cellular activities, the Krebs cycle still spinning its carbohydrate breakdown. The secret goldfish draws close to the center of the cosmos. In the black hole of familial carelessness, he awaits the graceful moment when the mother, spurred on by Teddy, will give yet another soft shriek. She’ll lean close to the glass and put her eye there to search for Fish. Fish will be there, of course, hiding in the core of the murk near the figurine, playing possum, so that she will, when she sees him, feel the pitiful sinking in her gut—remembering the preschool field trip to Pet Universe—and<span data-page="page_final"></span> a sorrow so deep it will send her to her knees to weep. She’ll think of the sad little pet funeral she hoped to perform when Fish died (when Fish’s sidekick died, Dad flushed him away): a small but deeply meaningful moment in the back yard, with the trowel, digging a shoebox-size hole, putting the fish in, performing a small rite (“Dear Lord, dear Heavenly Father, dear Fish God, God of Fish, in Fish’s name we gather here to put our dear fish to rest”), and then placing atop the burial mound a big rock painted with the word “<em class="small">fish</em>.” It would be a moment designed to teach the children the ways of loss, and the soft intricacies of seeing something that was once alive now dead, and to clarify that sharp defining difference, to smooth it over a bit, so that they will remember the moment and know, later, recalling it, that she was a good mother, the kind who would hold pet funerals.</p><p>But Fish is alive. His big old carp gills clutch and lick every tiny trace of oxygen from the froth of depravity in the inexplicably determinate manner that only animals have. He will have nothing to do with this household. And later that evening, once Dad is gone, they’ll hold a small party to celebrate his resurrection, because they had assumed—as was natural in these circumstances—that he was dead, or near enough death to be called dead, having near-death visions, as the dead are wont: that small pinpoint of light at the end of the tunnel and visions of an existence as a fish in some other ethery world, a better world for a fish, with fresh clear water bursting with oxygen and other carp large and small in communal bliss and just enough muck and mud for good pickings. After the celebration, before bedtime, they’ll cover the top of the clean tank in plastic wrap and, working together, moving slowly with the unison of pallbearers, being careful not to slosh the water, carry it down the stairs to the family room, where with a soft patter of congratulatory applause they’ll present Fish with a new home, right next to the television set. ♦</p>	David Means	May 31, 2004 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/05/31/the-secret-goldfish	Adultery	Aquariums	Children	Death	Divorce	Families	Unnamed	Third	Death
The Use of Poetry	<p>It <span data-page="page_1"></span>surprised no one to learn that Michael Beard had been an only child, and he would have been the first to concede that he’d never quite got the hang of brotherly feeling. His mother, Angela, was an angular beauty who doted on him, and the medium of her love was food. She bottle-fed him with passion, surplus to demand. Some four decades before he won the Nobel Prize in Physics, he came top in the Cold Norton and District Baby Competition, birth-to-six-months class. In those harsh postwar years, ideals of infant beauty resided chiefly in fat, in Churchillian multiple chins, in dreams of an end to rationing and of the reign of plenty to come. Babies were exhibited and judged like prize marrows, and, in 1947, the five-month-old Michael, bloated and jolly, swept all before him. However, it was unusual at a village fête for a middle-class woman, a stockbroker’s wife, to abandon the cake-and-chutney stall and enter her child for such a gaudy event. She must have known that he was bound to win, just as she later claimed always to have known that he would get a scholarship to Oxford. Once he was on solids, and for the rest of her life, she cooked for him with the same commitment with which she had held the bottle, sending herself in the mid-sixties, despite her illness, on a Cordon Bleu cookery course so that she could try new meals during his occasional visits home. Her husband, Henry, was a meat-and-two-veg man, who despised garlic and the smell of olive oil. Early in the marriage, for reasons that remained private, Angela withdrew her love from him. She lived for her son, and her legacy was clear: a fat man who restlessly craved the attentions of beautiful women who could cook.</p><p>Henry Beard was a lean sort with a drooping mustache and slicked-back brown hair, whose dark suits and brown tweeds seemed a cut too large, especially around the neck. He provided for his miniature family well and, in the fashion of the time, loved his son sternly and with little physical contact. Though he never embraced Michael, and rarely laid an affectionate hand on his shoulder, he supplied all the right kinds of present—Meccano and chemistry sets, a build-it-yourself wireless, encyclopedias, model airplanes, and books about military history, geology, and the lives of great men. He had had a long war, serving as a junior officer in the infantry in Dunkirk, North Africa, and Sicily, and then, as a lieutenant colonel, in the D Day landings, where he won a medal. He had arrived at the concentration camp of Belsen a week after it was liberated, and was stationed in Berlin for eight months after the war ended. Like many men of his generation, he did not speak about his experiences and he relished the ordinariness of postwar life, its tranquil routines, its tidiness and rising material well-being, and, above all, its lack of danger—everything that would later appear stifling to those born in the first years of the peace.</p><p>In 1952, when Michael was five, the forty-year-old Henry Beard gave up his job at a merchant bank in the City and returned to his first love, which was the law. He became a partner in an old firm in nearby Chelmsford and stayed there for the rest of his working life. To celebrate the momentous change and his liberation from the daily commute to Liverpool Street, he bought himself a secondhand Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud. This pale-blue machine lasted him thirty-three years, until his death. From the vantage of adulthood, and with some retrospective guilt, his son loved him for this grand gesture. But the life of a small-town solicitor, absorbed by matters of conveyancing and probate, settled on Henry Beard an even greater tranquillity. At weekends, he mostly cared for his roses, or his car, or golf with fellow-Rotarians. He stolidly accepted his loveless marriage as the price he must pay for his gains.</p><p>It was about this time that Angela Beard began a series of affairs that stretched over eleven years. Young Michael registered no outward hostilities or silent tensions in the home, but, then, he was neither observant nor sensitive, and was often in his room after school, building, reading, gluing, and later took up pornography and masturbation full time, and then girls. Nor, at the age of seventeen, did he notice that his mother had retreated, exhausted, to the sanctuary of her marriage. He heard of her adventures only when she was dying of breast cancer, in her early fifties. She seemed to want his forgiveness for ruining his childhood. By then he was nearing the end of his second year at Oxford and his head was full of maths and girlfriends, physics and drinking, and at first he could not take in what she was telling him. She lay propped up on pillows in her private room on the nineteenth floor of a tower-block hospital, with views toward the industrialized salt marshes by Canvey Island and the south shore of the Thames. He was grownup enough to know that it would have insulted her to say that he had noticed nothing. Or that she was apologizing to the wrong person. Or that he could not imagine anyone over thirty having sex. He held her hand and squeezed it to signal his warm feelings,<span data-page="page_2"></span> and said that there was nothing to forgive.</p><p>It was only after he had driven home, and drunk three nightcap Scotches with his father, then gone to his old room and lain on the bed fully dressed and considered what she had told him, that he grasped the extent of her achievement. Seventeen lovers in eleven years. Lieutenant Colonel Beard had had all the excitement and danger he could stand by the age of thirty-three. Angela had to have hers. Her lovers were her desert campaign against Rommel, her D Day, and her Berlin. Without them, she had told Michael from her hospital pillows, she would have hated herself and gone mad. But she hated herself anyway, for what she thought she had done to her only child. He went back to the hospital the next day and, while she sweatily clung to his hand, told her that his childhood had been the happiest and most secure imaginable, that he had never felt neglected or doubted her love or eaten so well, and that he was proud of what he called her appetite for life and hoped to emulate it. It was the first time that he had ever given a speech. These half and quarter truths were the best words he had ever spoken. Six weeks later, she was dead. Naturally, her love life was a closed subject between father and son, but for years afterward Michael could not drive through Chelmsford or the surrounding villages without wondering whether this or that old fellow tottering along the pavement or slumped near a bus stop was one of the seventeen.</p><p>By the standards of the day, he was a precocious lad when he arrived at Oxford. He had already made love to two girls, he owned a car, a split-screen Morris Minor, which he kept in a lockup garage off the Cowley Road, and he had an allowance from his father that was far in excess of what other grammar-school boys received. He was clever, sociable, opinionated, unimpressed by and even a little scornful of boys from famous schools. He was one of those types, infuriating and indispensable, who were at the front of every queue, had tickets to key events in London, within days knew strategically important people and all kinds of shortcuts, social as well as topographic. He looked much older than eighteen, and was hardworking, organized, tidy, and actually owned and used a desk diary. People sought him out because he could repair radios and record-players and kept a soldering iron in his room. For these services he never asked for money, of course, but he had the knack of calling in favors.</p><p>Within weeks of settling in, he had a girlfriend, a “bad” girl from Oxford High named Susan Doty. Other boys studying maths and physics tended to be closed, mousy types. Outside of lab work and tutorials, Beard kept well clear of them, and he also avoided the arty sort of people—they intimidated him with literary references he did not understand. He preferred instead the engineers, who gave him access to their workshops, and the geographers, zoologists, and anthropologists, especially the ones who had already done field work in strange places. Beard knew many people but had no close friends. He was never exactly popular, but he was well known, talked about, useful to people, and faintly despised.</p><p>At the end of his second year, while he was trying to accustom himself to the idea that his mother would soon die, Beard overheard someone in a pub refer to a student at Lady Margaret Hall named Maisie Farmer as a “dirty girl.” The phrase was used approvingly, as though it were a well-established category of some clinical accuracy. Her bucolic name in this connection intrigued him. He thought of a generous strapping lass, manure-streaked, astride a tractor—and then did not think about her again. The term ended, he went home, his mother died, and the summer was lost to grief and boredom and numbing, inarticulate silences at home with his father. They had never discussed feelings before, and had no language for them now. Once, when he saw from the house his father at the bottom of the garden, examining the roses too closely, he was embarrassed, no, horrified, to realize from the tremors of his father’s shoulders that he was weeping. It did not occur to Michael to go out to him. Knowing about his mother’s lovers, and not knowing whether his father knew—he guessed he did not—was another impossible obstacle.</p><p>He returned to Oxford in September and took a third-floor room in Park Town, a down-at-heel mid-Victorian crescent arranged around a central garden. His walk to the physics buildings each day took him past the front gates of the “dirty girl” ’s college, by the narrow passageway to University Parks. One morning, on impulse, he wandered in and established at the porter’s lodge that a student by the name of Maisie Farmer indeed existed. He discovered later in the same week that she was in her third year, doing English, but he did not let that put him off. For a day or two he wondered about her, and then work and other matters took over and he forgot all about her again, and it was not until late October that a friend introduced him to her and another girl outside the<span data-page="page_3"></span> Museum of Natural History.</p><p>She was not as he had imagined, and at first he was disappointed. She was small, almost frail, intensely pretty, with dark eyes and scant eyebrows and a musical voice with a surprising accent, a hint of Cockney, which was unusual in a woman at university in those days. When, in answer to her question, he told her what his subject was, her face went blank and soon she walked on with her friend. He bumped into her alone two days later and asked her to come for a drink and she said no, and said it immediately, before he had quite finished his sentence. It was a measure of Beard’s self-confidence that he was surprised. But what did she see in front of her? A stout fellow with an accountant’s look and an earnest manner, wearing a tie (in 1967!), with short hair, side-parted, and, the damning detail, a pen clipped into the breast pocket of his jacket. And he was studying science, a non-subject for fools. She said goodbye politely enough and went on her way, but Beard walked after her and asked if she was free the next day, or the day after that, or at the weekend. No, no, and no. Then he said brightly, “How about ever?,” and she laughed pleasantly, genuinely amused by his persistence, and seemed on the point of changing her mind. But she said, “There’s always never? Can you make never?,” to which he replied, “I’m not free,” and she laughed again and made a sweet little mock punch to his lapel with a child-size fist and walked off, leaving him with the impression that he still had a chance, that she had a sense of humor, that he might wear her down.</p><p>He did. He researched her. Someone told him that she had a special interest in John Milton. It did not take long to discover the century to which this man belonged. A third-year literature student in Beard’s college who owed him a favor (for procuring tickets to a Cream concert) gave him an hour on Milton, what to read, what to think. He read “Comus” and was astounded by its silliness. He read through “Lycidas,” “Samson Agonistes,” and “Il Penseroso”— stilted and rather prissy in parts, he thought. He fared better with “Paradise Lost” and, like many before him, preferred Satan’s party to God’s. He, Beard, that is, memorized passages that appeared to him intelligent and especially sonorous. He read a biography, and four essays that he had been told were pivotal. The reading took him one long week. He came close to being thrown out of an antiquarian bookshop in the Turl when he casually asked for a first edition of “Paradise Lost.” He tracked down a kindly tutor who knew about buying old books and confided to him that he wanted to impress a girl with a certain kind of present, and was directed to a bookshop in Covent Garden where he spent half a term’s money on an eighteenth-century edition of “Areopagitica.” When he speed-read it on the train back to Oxford, one of the pages cracked in two. He repaired it with Sellotape.</p><p>Then, naturally enough, he bumped into her again, this time by the gates of her college, where he had been waiting for two and a half hours. He asked if he could at least walk with her across the Parks. She didn’t say no. She was wearing an Army-surplus greatcoat, over a yellow cardigan, and a black pleated skirt and patent-leather shoes with strange silver buckles. She was even more beautiful than he had thought. As they went along he politely inquired about her work, and she explained, as though to a village idiot, that she was writing about Milton, a well-known English poet of the seventeenth century. He asked her to be more precise about her essay. She was. He ventured an informed opinion. Surprised, she spoke at greater length. To elucidate some point of hers, he quoted the lines “from morn / To noon he fell,” and she breathily completed them: “from noon to dewy eve.” Making sure to keep his tone tentative, he spoke of Milton’s childhood, and then of the Civil War. There were things she did not know and was interested to learn. She knew little of the poet’s life, and, amazingly, it seemed that it was not part of her studies, to consider the circumstances of his times. Beard steered her back onto familiar ground. They quoted more of their favorite lines. He asked her which Milton scholars she had read. He had read some of them, too, and gently proved it. He had glanced over a bibliography, and his conversation far outran his reading. She disliked “Comus” even more than he did, so he ventured a mild defense and allowed himself to be demolished.</p><p>Then he spoke of “Areopagitica” and its relevance to modern politics. At this she stopped on the path and asked significantly what a scientist was doing, knowing so much about Milton, and he thought he had been rumbled. He pretended to be just a little insulted. All knowledge interested him, he said; the demarcations between subjects were mere conveniences or historical accidents or the inertia of tradition. To illustrate his point, he drew on tidbits that he had picked up from his<span data-page="page_4"></span> anthropologist and zoologist friends. With a first touch of warmth in her voice, she began to ask him questions about himself, though she did not care to hear about physics. And where was he from? Essex, he said. But so was she! From Chingford! That was his lucky break, and he seized his chance. He asked her to dinner. She said yes.</p><p>He was to count that misty, sunny November afternoon, along the Cherwell river by the Rainbow Bridge, as the point at which the first of his marriages began. Three days later he took her to dinner at the Randolph Hotel, by which time he had completed another whole day of Milton. It was already clear that his own special study would be the physics of light, and he was naturally drawn to the poem of that name, and learned its last dozen lines by heart. Over the second bottle of wine, he talked to her of its pathos, a blind man lamenting what he would never see, then celebrating the redeeming power of the imagination. Over the starched tablecloth, wineglass in hand, he recited it to her, ending, “thou Celestial light / Shine inward, and the mind through all her powers / Irradiate, there plant eyes, all mist from thence / Purge and disperse, that I may see and tell / Of things invisible to mortal sight.” At these lines he saw the tears well in Maisie’s eyes, and reached under his chair to produce his gift, “Areopagitica,” bound in calf leather in 1738. She was stunned. A week later, illicitly in her room, to the sound of “Sgt. Pepper’s” playing on the Dansette record-player he had repaired for her that afternoon with smoking soldering iron, they were lovers at last. The term “dirty girl,” with its suggestion that she was general property, was now obnoxious to him. Still, she was far bolder and wilder, more experimental and generous in lovemaking, than any girl he had known. She also cooked a fine steak-and-kidney pie. He decided he was in love.</p><p>Going after Maisie was a relentless, highly organized pursuit, and it gave him great satisfaction, and it was a turning point in his development, for he knew that no third-year arts person, however bright, could have passed himself off, after a week’s study, among the undergraduate mathematicians and physicists who were Beard’s colleagues. The traffic was one way. His Milton week made him suspect a monstrous bluff. The reading was a slog, but he encountered nothing that could remotely be construed as an intellectual challenge, nothing on the scale of difficulty he encountered daily in his course. That very week of the Randolph dinner, he had studied the Ricci scalar and finally understood its use in general relativity. At least, he thought he could grasp these extraordinary equations. The theory was no longer an abstraction; it was sensual. He could <em>feel</em> the way the seamless fabric of space-time might be warped by matter, and how this fabric influenced the movement of objects, how gravity was conjured by its curvature. He could spend half an hour staring at the handful of terms and subscripts of the crux of the field equations and understand why Einstein himself had spoken of its “incomparable beauty,” and why Max Born had said that it was “the greatest feat of human thinking about nature.”</p><p>This understanding was the mental equivalent of lifting very heavy weights—not possible at first attempt. He and his lot were at lectures and lab work nine till five every day, attempting to grasp some of the hardest things ever thought. The arts people fell out of bed at midday for their two tutorials a week. He suspected that there was nothing they talked about at those meetings that anyone with half a brain could fail to understand. He had read four of the best essays on Milton. He <em>knew</em>. And yet they passed themselves off as his superiors, these lie-abeds, and he had let them intimidate him. No longer. From the moment he won Maisie, he was intellectually free.</p><p>Many years later, Beard told this story and his conclusions to an English professor in Hong Kong, who said, “But, Michael, you’ve missed the point. If you had seduced ninety girls with ninety poets, one a week in a course of three academic years, and remembered them all at the end—the poets, I mean—and synthesized your reading into some kind of aesthetic overview, then you would have earned yourself a degree in English literature. But don’t pretend that it’s easy.”</p><p>But it seemed so at the time, and he was far happier during his final year, and so was Maisie. She persuaded him to grow his hair, to wear jeans instead of flannels, and to stop <em>repairing</em> things. It wasn’t cool. And they became cool, even though they were both rather short. He gave up Park Town and found a tiny flat in Jericho, where they set up together. Her friends, all literature and history students, became his. They were wittier than his other friends, and lazier, of course, and had a developed sense of pleasure, as though they felt they were owed. He cultivated new opinions—on the distribution of wealth, Vietnam, the events in Paris, the coming revolution, and LSD, which he declared to be important, though he refused to take it. When he heard himself sounding off, he was<span data-page="page_5"></span> not at all convinced, and was amazed that no one took him for a fraud. He tried pot and disliked it intensely for the way it interfered with his memory. Despite the usual parties, with howling music and terrible wine in sodden paper cups, he and Maisie never stopped working. Summer came, and finals, and then, to their stupid surprise, it was all over and everyone dispersed.</p><p>They both got firsts. Beard was offered the place he wanted at the University of Sussex, to do a Ph.D. They went to Brighton together and found a fine place to move into in September, an old rectory in an outlying village on the Sussex Downs. The rent was beyond them and so, before returning to Oxford, they agreed to share with a couple studying theology, who had newborn identical twins. The Chingford newspaper ran a story about the local working-class girl who had “soared to the heights,” and it was from these heights, and to hold together their disintegrating milieu, that they decided to get married—not because it was the conventional thing to do but precisely because it was the opposite, it was exotic, it was hilarious and camp and harmlessly old-fashioned, like the tasselled military uniforms the Beatles wore in promotional pictures for their sensational LP. For that reason, the couple did not invite or even inform their parents. They were married in the Oxford registry office, and got drunk on Port Meadow with a handful of friends who came for the day. The new age dawned, the arrogant, shameless, spoiled generation turned its back on the fathers who had fought the war, dismissing them for their short hair and tidy ways and their indifference to rock and roll. Lieutenant Colonel (retired) Henry Beard D.S.O., living alone in the old house at Cold Norton, did not learn of his son’s marriage until after the divorce.</p><p>The name of the married theology students was Gibson, Charlie and Amanda, and they were devout and intellectual, against the fashion of the time, and studied at an institute in Lewes. Their god, by way of mysterious love, or an urge to punish, had conferred on them two babies of a giant size and type who would easily have snatched the prize from Beard in ’47, twins who never slept and rarely ceased their identical piercing wails, who set each other off if they ever failed to start up in step, and who jointly propelled a miasma through the elegant house, as penetrative as a curry on the stove, a prawn vindaloo, but rank like sea swamp, as though they were confined for reasons of religion to a diet of guano and mussels.</p><p>Young Beard, working in the bedroom on the early calculations that would lead him to his life’s work—his life’s free ride—stuffed wads of blotting paper in his ears and kept the windows open, even in midwinter. When he went downstairs to make himself coffee, he would encounter the couple in the kitchen, in some aspect of their private hell, dark-eyed and irritable from lack of sleep and mutual loathing, as they divvied up their awful tasks, which included prayer and meditation. The generous hallway and living spaces of the Georgian rectory were rendered charmless by the hundred protruding metal and plastic tools and devices of modern child care. Neither adult nor infant Gibsons expressed any pleasure in their own or one another’s existence. Why would they? Beard privately swore to himself that he would never become a father.</p><p>And Maisie? She changed her mind about a doctorate on Aphra Behn; she turned down a job in the university library and signed on instead for social-security benefits. In another century she would have been considered a woman of leisure, but in the twentieth she was “active.” She read up on social theory, attended a group run by a collective of Californian women, and started up a “workshop” herself, a new concept at the time, and though, in conventional terms, she no longer soared, her consciousness was raised, and within a short time she confronted the blatant fact of patriarchy and her husband’s role in a network of oppression that extended from the institutions that sustained him as a man, even though he could not acknowledge the fact, to the nuances of his small talk.</p><p>It was, as she said at the time, like stepping through a mirror. Everything looked different, and it was no longer possible to be innocently content, not for her, and, therefore, not for him. Certain matters were settled after serious discussion. He was too much of a rationalist to think of many good reasons that he should not help out around the house. He believed that it bored him more than it did her, but he did not say so. And washing a few dishes was the least of it. There were profoundly entrenched attitudes that he needed to examine and change, there were unconscious assumptions of his own “centrality,” his alienation from his own feelings, his failure to listen, to hear, really <em>hear</em> what she was saying, and to understand how the system that worked in his favor in both trivial and important ways always worked against her. One example was this: he could go to the village pub for a pleasant pint on his own, while she could not do so without being stared at by the<span data-page="page_final"></span> locals and made to feel like a whore. There was his unexamined belief in the importance of his work, in his objectivity, and in rationality itself. He failed to grasp that knowing himself was a vital undertaking. There were other ways of knowing the world, women’s ways, which he treated dismissively. Though he pretended not to be, he was squeamish about her menstrual blood, which was an insult to the core of her womanhood. Their lovemaking, blindly enacting postures of dominance and submission, was an imitation of rape and was fundamentally corrupt.</p><p>Months passed, and many evening sessions, during which Beard mostly listened and, in the pauses, thought about work. During that period, he was thinking a good deal about photons, from a radically different angle. Then, one night, he and Maisie were woken, by the twins as usual, and lay side by side on their backs in the dark while she broke the news that she was leaving him. She had thought this through and did not want an argument. There was a commune forming in the sodden hills of mid-Wales and she intended to join it and did not think she would ever return. She knew, in ways that he could never understand, that this must be her course now. There were issues of her self-realization, her past, and her identity as a woman that she felt bound to follow through. It was her duty. At this point, Beard felt himself overtaken by a powerful and unfamiliar emotion that tightened his throat and forced from his chest a sob that he was powerless to contain. It was a sound that surely all the Gibsons heard through the wall. It could easily have been confused with a shout. What he experienced was a compound of joy and relief, followed by a floating, expansive sensation of lightness, as if he were about to drift free of the sheets and bump against the ceiling. Suddenly, it was all before him, the prospect of freedom, of working whenever he wanted, of inviting home some of the women he had seen on the Falmer campus, lolling on the steps outside the library, of returning to his unexamined self and being guiltlessly shot of Maisie. All this caused a tear of gratitude to roll down his cheek. He also felt fierce impatience for her to be gone. It crossed his mind to offer to drive her to the station now, but there were no trains from Lewes at 3 <em class="small">A.M.</em>, and she had not packed. Hearing his sob, she reached for the bedside light and, leaning over to look into his face, saw the dampness around his eyes. Firmly and deliberately she whispered, “I will not be blackmailed, Michael. I will not, repeat <em>not</em>, be emotionally manipulated by you into staying.”</p><p>Was ever a marriage dissolved so painlessly? Within a week she had left for the hill farm in Powys. In the course of a year they exchanged a couple of postcards. Then one came from an ashram in India, where she remained for three years and from where she sent one day her cheery acceptance of a divorce, all papers duly signed. He did not see her until his twenty-sixth birthday, at which she appeared with a shaved head and a jewel in her nose. Many years later, he spoke at her funeral. Perhaps it was the ease of their parting in the old rectory that made him so incautious about marrying again, and again. ♦</p>	Ian McEwan	December 7, 2009 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/12/07/the-use-of-poetry	Adultery	Childhood	Death	Divorce	England	Fathers	Michael Beard	Third	Death
The Yellow	<p>With <span data-page="page_1"></span>his mother and father out of town for the weekend, Roy was left to forage for food in their nearly empty refrigerator. Was he physically or mentally unable to go grocery shopping? To order takeout from a restaurant? No, he wasn’t.</p><p>Roy nibbled on a raw-onion-and-Cheddar sandwich, but the rattling house unnerved him and the sandwich was too strong. He felt exposed in the kitchen. What made a house rattle? He couldn’t say. He abandoned his meal on the countertop and switched on the living-room TV. He sat through the evening sitcoms, the late news, the late shows, and the start of a movie he’d not seen since 1985, telling himself that the noises he’d heard were cable wires scraping against the siding in the wind. Even if they weren’t.</p><p>At forty-two, he was living in his parents’ house again, eating their food, driving their car from job interview to job interview.</p><p>“A pity,” his grandmother had decided.</p><p>Near two in the morning, sick from so much TV, his grandmother’s pronouncement in his head, Roy riled himself into a fury of determined self-improvement. He spent the early-morning hours in his bedroom tearing down homemade Bevis Frond posters and a paper chain he’d fashioned from gum wrappers. He moved all the furniture—except his bed and his dresser—up to the attic. In the basement, Roy found a half-full can of paint his father had used to mark the curb out front as a no-parking zone. Roy carefully began to paint his walls bright yellow.</p><p>He went without sleep. What was sleep to him? And by eleven the next morning his work was done. He sat cross-legged on the floor inhaling heady fumes. Yellow was everywhere. Yellow and calm. Fear and confusion left. Possibility and sunshine became his friends. In the yellow, he felt himself the newborn child of Patti Smith and Jacques Cousteau. Roy rolled a cigarette and visualized foreign, gentler lands: India, Morocco, Florida.</p><p>Eventually, late Sunday evening, his parents returned. His father, registering the new color of the walls, asked, “Son, did you turn faggot over the weekend?”</p><p>Roy offered no comeback. He held on to the color. He picked a flake of tobacco from his tongue and admired his father’s use of the verb “turn.” Turn was precisely what Roy had done after three days of ripening in silence. He’d turned. He’d fermented into something wonderful and open, something porous and bright yellow.</p><p>Susanne’s turning, on the other hand, had been far more subtle. Perhaps she didn’t even realize she had turned, or maybe turning comes easier to women, acclimated as they are to miracles and pregnancies. Of which, by the age of thirty-nine, she’d had three. Roy walked out on his father without answering. He grabbed the car keys from the kitchen table. He drove. And while he drove he tangled with the scan button on the car radio. “Don’t Do Me Like That.” “Don’t Bring Me Down.” “Love Is a Rose.” “Straight Tequila Night.” He liked all those songs, but that didn’t stop him from continuing to seek. There had to be something more—his itchy finger was sure. And there was. “Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain.” The song made him forget that his much younger sister would be getting married next month. He drove, open, porous, and yellow, his tires floating above the asphalt. He drove, threading together seams and streets, all his ideas, until, quite suddenly, the night became rigid. In one moment, there was nothing—no music, no thoughts, just a pure electric shock of adrenaline. Something black and furry had darted out into the road, frozen in Roy’s headlights, and tumbled out of view. Squeals, brakes, and wrong-sounding mechanical thumpings followed. He had hit a dog. Roy had hit someone’s dog.</p><p>Pulling off onto the soft shoulder, he felt a certain resistance from the undercarriage. The vehicle and the animal had been joined in a terrible union. He sat without moving. Perhaps it wasn’t a dog. Perhaps it was some other creature, a beast unnamed and unknown. The thought gave him pause. It had been a strange weekend. He sat. Not long but long enough to know that whatever it was was truly dead. There’d be no awful scenes. No watching it limp away into the dark night, no gnashing teeth. He would not have to back the car up and over the creature in an attempt to kill it a second time.</p><p>Eventually Roy got out and the night stayed silent.</p><p>He circled the vehicle two, three times. There was nothing to be seen. Overhead, black branches cut their silhouettes on the navy sky. Roy crouched and there it was. Just a dog. Simple. Its body had been wedged behind a back wheel. Roy grabbed its tail and yanked the broken thing out from under. Something tore like fabric. The neck was soft and floppy, like a harshly used work shirt. The dog was dead for certain. Roy hoisted the animal into his arms and set out for the nearest driveway. He could see it up ahead. An outdoor floodlight spilled onto the road in a narrow swath, most of the light getting trapped in the yard by a line of tall maples. The dog’s body, not yet cold, warmed Roy and kept his arms from shaking.</p><p>Roy rang the bell, but Susanne was vacuuming. He carried the dog<span data-page="page_2"></span> around to the side door. Front doors are for holidays. The dog’s brown eye caught the light. It was no holiday. As Roy waited on the stoop, Susanne, with a vacuum hose in hand—her exhausted life—came into view. His knocking grew more desperate. He couldn’t very well leave the carcass on her doorstep. He’d be forced to carry the dog from house to house until someone was courageous enough to claim it.</p><p>She started when she saw Roy. It wasn’t a busy street but, rather, the sort where too much wealth kept neighbors from dropping by unannounced.</p><p>Earlier, Susanne’s husband had detected a certain ticking in her, a bomb. He’d packed their children into the car and set out for a night of pizza and a double feature at the second-run movie theatre, leaving her alone to explode, splattering the house with a combination of things she’d ingested as a teen-ager, certain films and punk-rock records that confirmed what she’d guessed: one dies alone.</p><p>Best to have her family out of the way. Best to have them hidden in a dark cinema when the desire to chop her hair roughly and live on cigarettes surged. These bursts of freedom, while infrequent, were dangerous. Their self-indulgence could tear holes in evenings, marriages, families.</p><p>She’d been lost in the roar of the vacuum—a device that had the power to put her under a spell, into a trancelike state from which she could most easily contemplate the nature of the universe, the purpose of love, the purpose of death, and a fantasy she sometimes had of being bound nude to a parking meter in the city.</p><p>It was then that she saw Roy. What was he holding? She shut off her vacuum by yanking the plug from the wall. She opened the door.</p><p>“Hello.”</p><p>“Hello.”</p><p>“I’m afraid I’ve killed someone’s dog.”</p><p>“Yes,” she confirmed. “That’s Curtains. He belongs to my children.”</p><p>“Curtains?”</p><p>“It’s an old story.” And then, looking at the animal again, “Oh, dear.” She reached out and took the dog’s body from Roy and, for one moment, like an uninspired actor in the uninspired film her husband and children were just then watching, she brushed the skin of Roy’s forearm. She held his eyes, trying to remember if they’d met before.</p><p>“Poor Curtains.”</p><p>They had never met.</p><p>Roy hoped. Maybe she’d wanted the dog dead for some reason. Maybe she’d grown tired of feeding him or accidentally petting those tumorous lumps that old dogs get.</p><p>“I’m sorry.” Roy shook his chin. “He appeared out of nowhere. I didn’t even have an instant to brake. I’m sorry. Let me give you some money for a new dog.” He reached for his wallet. He was broke. “What does a dog cost?” There was sixteen bucks in his wallet.</p><p>“Two hundred and fifty dollars,” Susanne said. She carried the dog into the living room.</p><p>“Oh.” He fumbled and followed her. Two hundred and fifty seemed like robbery. “Can I write you a check?” He had two hundred and sixty-seven dollars in his bank account. If he wanted, he could go to an A.T.M. tonight and withdraw it all, long before she could cash his check.</p><p>Susanne covered Curtains with an afghan that had been draped across the couch. She crouched in front of the dog, shielding her pet from Roy. Death really was mortifying. What a thing for her dog to do—run out in front of a stranger’s car and open himself up. What desperation. He should have come to her, she thought foolishly. There was blood on Roy’s jacket. Blood on her arm, in her hair. Curtains’s insides made pornographically public.</p><p>“A check is fine. Make it out to Susanne Martin.”</p><p>“Susanne Martin. Certainly.” He found a seat and began to write.</p><p>One surprisingly rigid paw stuck out from beneath the blanket. She knew the paw well, dipped in white fur, claws that alternated black, ivory, black, ivory. A piano on her dog’s foot. She felt the dog lose his heat. She felt his body go cold.</p><p>As Susanne bent to hold his paw to her cheek, Roy saw that she loved the dog and he knew he wouldn’t go to the A.T.M.</p><p>“Oh,” Roy said. “Oh, no. I’m so sorry.” When nervous, he adopted an inflection that was not his own. His voice ratcheted up into a phony British accent, as if British accents were so appropriate, so authoritative that they could make any American dog be not dead. “I’m dreadfully sorry.” There it was. London, England, done very poorly. He joined her on the floor, wrapping a stiff arm around her shoulders. He stowed the check away in his jacket pocket. “Sh-h-h. There, now. There, now.”</p><p>Roy and Susanne sat by the rigid dog. She whimpered. She sounded like a tiny door creaking open. She wept and sniffled, wept and sniffled. Roy studied the wall’s molding, the wall itself, a trace of dust along the molding’s shaped ridge, an electrical outlet. What had he been thinking before the accident? He tapped his free hand against his temple and drew a blank.</p><p>Underneath his hand her shoulder felt cushioned in a way that his wasn’t. There was her skin. There was her muscle. There was her bone, her blood and all the blood’s attendant particles keeping her alive, particles whose names he’d never know. They were total strangers except for this<span data-page="page_3"></span> dead dog. He thought of the yellow and turned toward Susanne, locating her lips with his own—some way of knowing her. Susanne did not flinch and, after a few slow moments with his mouth resting motionless on hers, he inserted a pointed tongue. She accepted it.</p><p>Roy and Susanne lay back on the rug beside the dog’s carcass, beside the coffee table. Beneath the burned odor left by the vacuum, he could smell the dust still in the rug—salt and sand and dried skin from her kids, her husband, her now dead dog. Roy inhaled. And they stayed there locked in a silent trade. It wasn’t a kiss, exactly, but something equally spectacular. The night, for all the species of insects alive in it, barely noticed.</p><p>Eventually, time passed and he buried his fingers in the hair at the nape of her neck. He pulled her closer. His other arm found the small of her back and used this time-tested handle to unlock some ancient pattern; their bodies began to move.</p><p>My dog died for this bit of living, Susanne thought. She did not consider her husband. She brokered no possible connection between her husband and lying on the floor with a stranger.</p><p>Roy’s hands moved to unfasten, unhook, undress their bodies, conducting an urgently time-sensitive experiment. Her face was still damp from crying. In the shock of this unexpected coupling, he pinned her to the floor and she was a bird. He found his way inside and Susanne filled the room with sound, incantations that started with the routine “Oh, yes. God, yes,” and morphed into the unfamiliar “Take it. Take it all,” before winding up at the unnatural “Paint your landscape. Storm. Storm. Storm.” Not sexy, just peculiar. Pleasure remained a far-off cousin to whatever exchange they were having.</p><p>At last, his muscles and eyes trembled. A transfer was completed and the charge between them dimmed. A film of sweat developed some guilt, some old wonder. Both Roy and Susanne began to chill. He didn’t look at her. He was unsure what he’d got in the trade, though he knew that it wasn’t inconsequential. Good for him.</p><p>I should remove myself, he thought, and was about to when he felt something rough and warm, damp and thick.</p><p>Curtains was licking the sweat from his scapula.</p><p>With a scream, both man and woman recoiled. He rolled, boot-camp style, a protected ball, in the shelter of a baby grand, from which he eyed the dog with dread. She jumped to her feet and onto the frantic couch.</p><p>Curtains had come back from the dead.</p><p>The dog raised his brow, wondering why these humans should act so foolishly.</p><p>Susanne lifted her hands in surrender. “The dog was dead.”</p><p>“The dog was dead,” Roy confirmed. And it was true. They’d seen it and felt it. The dog, moments ago, had been ruined, limp, no more.</p><p>“How, Anne?” He used only half her name. Their new physical intimacy had shaved away the Sus. He cradled and rocked himself, a squatting troll: a head, a rounded back, and two feet sticking out from his torso. He looked grotesque underneath the piano.</p><p>Curtains licked the thin, pale fur between his legs.</p><p>“My dog is alive.”</p><p>“But why? Why is your dog alive?”</p><p>Susanne scratched her left buttock. “You must have only knocked Curtains unconscious.”</p><p>Roy looked from the dog to Susanne. “Then how come you don’t want to touch him, either?”</p><p>“Nonsense,” Susanne said, readjusting her position of retreat. “Come here, boy. Here, Curtains.”</p><p>The dog looked up from his lick and made his way over to the waiting hand. Susanne held her arm as far out from her body as possible. Curtains rubbed against it and Susanne immediately snapped her hand to her chest as if burned. She covered herself with a fleece blanket. “Back,” she told the confused dog. “Back.” Curtains, as dumb and happy as any non-dead dog, cocked his head and studied the hunkering humans before meandering into the kitchen to see if, in the time he’d been dead, someone had refilled his dish with kibble.</p><p>Quickly, Roy crawled out from underneath the piano. “What should we do?”</p><p>Susanne nodded. She stood, distancing herself from him. They were not a we. She dressed swiftly. Nodding, nodding, nodding. She tightened a belt around her sweater. “So,” she said, looking into the kitchen where Curtains had gone. “You’ll have to kill it. Again.”</p><p>Roy drew his eyes wide and wider. “What? It?”</p><p>“We’ve opened some sort of door here.” She knelt in front of Roy, resting her hands on his knees as if they really were lovers. “It can’t stay open. I have a good life.” She pinched the meat of Roy’s thighs. “You have to kill the dog.”</p><p>He closed his eyes. Reasons and excuses assembled themselves. He was dealing with an unhinged person. He’d stumbled into a TV show. The dog had simply been knocked out.</p><p>Roy opened his eyes.</p><p>“It won’t work. That’s like stuffing a baby back inside its mother. You think I’ll just forget? I won’t forget.”</p><p>“Yes,” Susanne said. “You will forget.”</p><p>Once, as a girl, Susanne, alone in her grandmother’s empty barn, had heard a voice speaking to her. The voice had said, “Bow at the river,” or, maybe, “Cows at the river.” It didn’t matter what the voice had said, because Susanne, terrorized<span data-page="page_final"></span> and unwilling to confront the unexplainable, had suppressed any memory of it. “You’ll forget.”</p><p>He put his head in his hands.</p><p>“You’ll find some way to explain it. You’ll call me a witch or a crazy person. Turn it into a dream. You’ll forget.” She stood and, searching Roy’s coat, found the check, folded it, and put it in her pocket. “You have to kill him and then you have to leave.”</p><p>Roy pulled his fingers through his hair, like a child having a tantrum. “But I don’t believe in magic.” He barely believed in God. He barely believed in chiropractors.</p><p>She kept her voice calm. “That’s like not believing in car accidents. Just because you don’t want them to happen doesn’t mean they don’t.” She clucked at him, scolding. “It’s not belief. It’s whether or not you’re going to let magic ruin your life. People pretend the world is ordinary every day.” She held her hips. “Because they have to.”</p><p>“Why don’t <em>you</em> kill him?”</p><p>“Come on,” she tsk-tsked. “You started this. You kissed me.”</p><p>“It wasn’t really a kiss,” Roy said. All he’d done was paint his walls yellow. “And I definitely didn’t raise your dog from the dead.”</p><p>“Yeah?” She was leaving the room, matter settled. “Then what did?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” he told her, but Susanne, having plugged the vacuum back in, was no longer listening.</p><p>From the dark behind her house, he saw the warm glow of her windows, her family returning. He leaned on the shovel.</p><p>“Out! Out!” she had said. Once for Roy, once for Curtains. “There’s a shovel in the shed.”</p><p>Roy stood in the night undetected, looking in. Her children and her husband gathered around her, relaying the very thin but fantastically absurd plots of the Hollywood movies they’d seen. A bank heist and a clean getaway. A love that conquers all. A dog that comes back to life. Her young son’s hands shook, his feet stomped, recalling the wonders. How true they’d been. Her daughter’s head spun. Each world had been real enough to betray her by ending neatly after an hour and a half.</p><p>Susanne retracted the vacuum’s cord. Tethered again. And in the dark Roy understood her family’s pact. Work and school, laundry, dinner, the things that happened in their lives were not part of the brightness that she and Roy had glimpsed but were, rather, dull, quite expected, and entirely unastonishing. Nothing strange ever really happened. No, it didn’t.</p><p>The weight of the shovel made Roy’s arms burn. He needed to sit down. He needed to get back in his car, start the engine, drive away from here with his finger on the radio’s scan button, looking for the right song, one that might erase Susanne, the dog, and the shovel she’d wanted him to use to brain and bury Curtains in her back yard.</p><p>The dog looked up at him, tilting its head a bit to one side, waiting for the blow of the shovel’s blade. “No,” Roy told him.</p><p>He would leave soon. He’d drive through the night listening as each song began hot with promise. “More Than a Feeling.” “Don’t Stop Believing.” “Time After Time.” Fine songs. He knew them well. He’d heard them all hundreds of times, as if he’d been driving the Earth forever, killing any and all things that got in the way. None of the songs would ever make him forget and he told Curtains so. “Scram,” he yelled. “Get out of here!”</p><p>Curtains turned and wandered off to pee on some rhododendrons, not at all like an animal running for its life. The dog would be waiting on her doorstep tomorrow morning, gentle, stupid, still undead, still looking for something to eat. In front of her children she’d pretend to forget. She’d hold out her hand to pet the dog’s head and in a while, perhaps a few days or a week, the head would begin to feel like the head of any dog. In the dark it was clear. Susanne sat on the couch, surrounded by her family, while out in the night, partner to the extraordinary, Roy held the shovel. ♦</p>	Samantha Hunt	November 29, 2010 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/11/29/the-yellow	Accidents	Adultery	Automobiles	Cars	Death	Dogs	Roy	Third	Death
