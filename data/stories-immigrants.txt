A Life of Adventure and Delight	<p>The side door of the police van slid open, rattling, and he was shoved inside. There were seven or eight men already sitting on the floor in the dark, their wrists handcuffed behind them. Nobody said anything. The van started with a jerk, then picked up speed. His legs were stretched out in front of him, and he tried to use his cuffed hands to balance himself, but the plastic cuffs tightened, and he and the other men went rolling across the floor like loose bottles.</p><p>This was the first time that Gautama had been arrested. Before calling the prostitute, he had Googled the number in the ad to make sure that it wasn’t being used by the police. In the van, he remembered how, as he was being hurried down the stairs of his building, one of the apartment doors was slightly ajar, a man in an undershirt staring at him as he was led past.</p><p>Gautama was twenty-four, tall, slender, with large brown eyes and longish hair that framed his face. He was a Ph.D. student in chemistry at New York University. He had arrived in America a year earlier, and, like many foreign students in America who are living away from home for the first time, he had immediately begun loitering on Craigslist and Backpage.</p><p>The arrested men stood in a cell on one side of a brightly lit room. It was a little after midnight. A short, stocky policewoman was taking mug shots. When she was done, she came over and, looking bored, her hands on her hips, said, “You know, when you have sex with a prostitute you might as well be having sex with every guy she’s slept with.”</p><p>A bearded Hasidic man sidled up to the front of the cell. “I was just e-mailing the girl,” he said. “I only offered money to help.” He had a high cracking voice, and his eyes were very wide. He spoke so sincerely that he seemed to believe himself. A Latino guy in a blue mechanic’s uniform was crouched in a corner of the cell, speaking tenderly through the bars to an underage prostitute who was seated on a folding chair, her slender wrist handcuffed to a bar. Until he began talking to the girl, the Latino had said only one thing, while being shoved into the van: “Shit, it’s my birthday.”</p><p>Around two in the morning, the men, all chained together, were led shuffling down the precinct steps. Gautama was near the end of the chain. The cold night air felt alien. He saw cars go by, their wheels hissing, and wanted to hide his face in his shoulder. The men ahead of him began climbing into the back of a white van. Gautama waited his turn, and as he did he felt that he and the other men had entered some strange enclosed world—there was a world that was spacious and normal, where people drove home at night, and, next to it, off to the side, was another world, a world so constricted that living in it was like walking a narrow passage between two walls.</p><p>In Central Booking, the men were led one by one into separate cells. The cells had bunk beds and steel toilets. In Gautama’s cell, the wall beside the toilet bore long fingerlike streaks of shit. He lay down on the lower bunk. He was wearing a gray sweatshirt. He hugged himself and pulled his knees to his stomach.</p><p>Gautama was from Gwalior, a small city in Madhya Pradesh, one of those wretched places where the streets are narrow and crowded and where shopkeepers in the central market sell illegal postcards of satis sitting on bonfires. When a merchant sold one to you, he’d touch the card to his forehead as if he wanted a last blessing before letting the goddess leave.</p><p>Gautama was an ordinary middle-class boy. He knew he would have to get married one day, and he hoped to have as much sex as possible before then, but he also believed that any Indian girl who had sex before marriage had something wrong with her, was in some way depraved and foul and also unintelligent. He wished he could have sex with Sunny Leone.</p><p>Gautama rolled over to face the cinder-block wall. From down the hall came the voice of a young man who had been in the holding cell with him. The young man had tried to start up conversations by asking the other men about their jobs. “I have cigarettes,” he now called to whoever might be listening. “You O.K.,” someone answered in fake solidarity.</p><p>Gautama’s favorite thing about hiring prostitutes was negotiating the price. This was because actually having sex with a prostitute seemed so immoral that it was hard to enjoy it. As soon as he’d called a prostitute and left a message with a made-up name, he’d start to feel scared of what he’d set in motion, and a part of him would not want the woman to call back. If she did, he’d get excited. His mouth would go dry. He’d ask whether the hundred and fifty roses that she asked for in her ad could be reduced. Often the woman hung up. Periodically, he and the prostitute would reach an agreement and set a time for her to come over.<span data-page="page_2"></span> Most often then, in a panic, he would hurry out of the apartment. He lived in the Bronx, next to a bodega near the Grand Concourse. He would rush to put some distance between him and his building and then walk for hours, his heart racing. Whenever people glanced at him, he’d feel as if they might grab him and beat him.</p><p>Occasionally, Gautama stayed in his apartment and waited for the woman to arrive. His building was a walkup, and he lived on the fourth floor, in a studio with a single large window, which was divided by metal brackets into many small panes. When the prostitute got to his apartment, she’d be out of breath and look irritated at having had to climb the stairs. He would invite her in and then tell her that she didn’t look like the photos she’d texted and ask her to reduce her price again. As he did this, he was hoping that the woman would just demand cab fare and leave. Usually, she shouted at him. Sometimes, cursing him, she reduced the price by ten or fifteen dollars. The actual sex after all this was almost always wretched: Gautama wearing double condoms, and the woman beneath him looking angry, telling him, “Don’t touch the breasts.”</p><p>As he lay on his side in the cell, a thought came to him: he should just get married. Most of his cousins who were his age were married already. He felt that if he were married he wouldn’t hire prostitutes, he wouldn’t be ridiculous, he wouldn’t do things like call a hooker and ask if the “afternoon delight” rate still applied, even though it was evening.</p><p>At eleven the next morning, Gautama was released.</p><p>For two days, he went to a park and picked up litter while wearing an orange vest. Kids went whizzing by him on bicycles, calling, “What you did, punk?” When he didn’t respond, one of them, emboldened, stopped a few feet from him and shouted, “I’ll make you my bitch!” It seemed to him that this was the world that his actions had brought him into. He picked up garbage and imagined being married, being a father, having a son. He imagined working hard and earning money to take care of his family. Imagining this, he felt comforted, as if he were already living that life.</p><p>Nirmala was a little over five feet tall. She had a round face and a round body and shiny black hair. She liked to gossip and laugh, especially about politicians. She, too, was from a small city, from a family of doctors. She had not been able to get into medical school, so she was getting a Ph.D. in biology. Nirmala was popular among the foreign graduate students. Partly this was because she was cheerful. Partly, also, it was because she was kind. She always remembered people’s birthdays and tried to organize a cake or a dinner or at least a card. When somebody was sick, she visited and brought food. Gautama had spoken to Nirmala only a few times. Since other people respected her, he assumed she was admirable.</p><p>Nirmala worked at the circulation desk in the big atrium at Bobst Library. Gautama began drifting among the shelves of reference books to look at her. Normally, she took her lunch break at twelve-thirty. One day, he walked up to the circulation desk. He felt self-conscious about his face, about his long body, about the fact that his breath might smell of coffee. “Do you want to have lunch?” he asked and giggled.</p><p>“With you?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>The graduate students from India, even when they didn’t know one another well, treated one another with the politeness of neighbors living in the same lane.</p><p>Gautama and Nirmala went to a seminar room to eat. There was a conference table, a whiteboard, a projector on a rolling table. They had brought their lunches in plastic grocery-store bags and, when they sat down, she asked what kind of water his city had. “Hard water,” he said, and she told him that she still found it amazing that in America one could drink from the tap.</p><p>They removed the aluminum foil their rotis were rolled up in. The crinkling of the foil sounded loud to Gautama. At first, they ate in silence, like people travelling together on a bus. Gautama had been imagining what kind of marriage he wanted, and he felt he needed to be as honest as possible in order to have the sort of relationship he was envisioning. He told Nirmala the thing that felt most precious to him.</p><p>“My sister has epilepsy.”</p><p>Gautama’s parents had not told his sister, his only sibling, what condition she had. They had told him, instead, because he was a boy. His sister was four years older than he was, and his relationship with her had always involved his feeling that he’d had good luck while she’d had bad. He was haunted by the image of his sister swallowing pills whose purpose she didn’t understand, standing beside the kitchen sink, taking one pill from their mother’s outstretched palm and then a second and then opening her mouth to show their mother that it was empty.</p><p>In India, public knowledge of his sister’s epilepsy would have marked the whole family as defective. Telling someone about her for<span data-page="page_3"></span> the first time, Gautama felt careless, immature, selfish. “When we began looking for a boy for her, my parents had to tell whoever was considering her about the epilepsy,” he said. Several of the families his parents negotiated with declined to pursue a marriage. One finally agreed to it after his parents promised a house in the city, a farm, and a foreign car. After the dowry had been agreed upon, the groom’s grandfather, feeling that he had not been adequately consulted, forbade the marriage.</p><p>Gautama was seventeen then. He went with his father to the electronics shop that the groom’s family owned. They stood in the parking lot outside the shop, surrounded by scooters. The sun was hot, and the diesel in the air hurt Gautama’s eyes and throat.</p><p>His father pleaded with the grandfather, who was wearing a white kurta pajama. “What is the matter?” his father said, touching the old man’s elbow. “She is a good girl. We have ordered the food for the engagement.”</p><p>“You tried to be smart, didn’t you?” the old man scolded. “Trying to hide your shame with such a large dowry.”</p><p>Because of her epilepsy, his sister, who had a bachelor’s degree, was now married to a laborer who had not finished high school. The man lived in Saudi Arabia doing construction work, and his parents treated Gautama’s sister as a servant.</p><p>As Nirmala listened, she looked concerned. After he’d finished speaking, she was silent for a while. Softly, she said, “When your sister’s children are ready for education, you can pay for it.” She said this because she knew that sometimes the only relief possible is the thought that one day we’ll be able to help in some small way. But Gautama had so much adrenaline in him that he had a hard time understanding what she was saying. She seemed to be talking about something other than what he had just told her.</p><p>Several hours later, sitting in an office chair, looking at a computer screen, in a very cold lab, he began to feel an unclenching. Having told somebody about his sister made the world feel bigger, as if there were more space around him. Simultaneously, the way fresh air can cause a cut to sting, arrived a new sense of horror at the image of his mother standing by his sister, making her swallow pills whose mysteriousness frightened her, and then saying, “Open,” until his sister opened her empty mouth.</p><p>Nirmala and Gautama began having lunch together every day. After a few days, Gautama stopped being nervous about asking her to join him.</p><p>They ate in seminar rooms that had glass walls and whiteboards. When they finished eating, they’d wipe down the table with wet paper towels. Then they’d take the plastic bags they’d brought their lunches in into the hallway and put them in the trash cans there, so that the odor would disperse. They did this because they felt self-conscious about the stereotype of how Indians smell.</p><p>Nirmala was flattered by Gautama’s attention. She saw herself as fat, lumbering. Once, a friend, a white girl who also worked at the circulation desk, gestured with her head toward Gautama as he walked over to them. “Your shadow has arrived,” she said. Nirmala knew that her friend was teasing, but having a shadow pleased her. She thought more often about Gautama, and as she thought more often about him he began to gain in importance for her.</p><p>After his arrest, Gautama had stopped going onto Backpage. Once he started having lunch with Nirmala, he also stopped looking at pornography. He did this because he wanted there to be no shame in his relationship with her.</p><p>As the days went by and they continued having lunch, he told her stories and found himself relieved of old anxieties. His family ran a nuts-and-dried-fruit business, and he told her how, when he was thirteen or fourteen, he had conspired with a family employee to steal money from one of the shops that his family owned. The man had then blackmailed him. After he told Nirmala this, the guilt of having stolen from his family, the sense of self-disgust for being so weak that he could be blackmailed, dissipated almost immediately. It vanished so quickly that it was like waking from a nightmare and within minutes not being able to recall what had happened in the dream.</p><p>One night, a month after they started having lunch, they went out to dinner. An Indian restaurant had opened on crowded Macdougal Street, and Gautama had read in a magazine that the restaurant, for its opening weeks, while it worked out its menu, was allowing guests to pay whatever they thought was fair. Gautama’s plan was to pay nothing. It didn’t occur to him that Nirmala would mind this.</p><p>The restaurant was in a basement. They went down some steps and entered a room with a dozen or so tables with white tablecloths. Only a few of the tables were occupied. Eight young Indians, probably undergraduates, were seated around the largest table, in the middle of the room, and the manager, an Indian man with a mustache, went over to them frequently to see how they were liking the meal. He didn’t go as often to the tables with white customers. Gautama understood that the manager was suspicious that the Indians would try to<span data-page="page_4"></span> get away with paying nothing. He saw this and felt in his stomach that he, too, would not have entered a restaurant with no intention of paying if it were owned by white people.</p><p>The manager came over to Gautama and Nirmala. He explained the pricing: “What would food like this cost in another restaurant? That is one way to think of it.” He spoke in the stretched vowels of an Indian trying to sound American. He left them to look at the menu.</p><p>Nirmala watched him go. “Are you planning not to pay?” she asked.</p><p>“I’ll pay something,” Gautama murmured. He stared down at the menu, which was a single page with a list of items on the left side and nothing on the right.</p><p>“Shrimp is expensive,” Nirmala said. “Fish is expensive. We can’t steal from these people.”</p><p>The fact that she wanted to pay when she didn’t have to surprised him. A part of him couldn’t believe it. He felt that she was showing off.</p><p>“I didn’t bring my purse. You should have told me to bring my wallet,” she said.</p><p>Hearing her frustration, he had the sense that he did not know her, that he had been revealing himself to someone who might have been thinking bad things about him.</p><p>The manager came back with a waiter. He explained again that they should bear in mind what the food might cost in another restaurant.</p><p>Nirmala ordered without looking up. She asked for the lentils, which would probably have been the cheapest item on the menu. “I’ll have the turmeric fish,” Gautama said, “and the seafood biryani.” He ordered two entrées because, despite the fear of embarrassment, he couldn’t pass up something free.</p><p>“It is a lot of food,” the manager said. At his American-sounding accent, Gautama felt even more judged. He kept looking down. The manager stood there for a moment and then left.</p><p>Gautama and Nirmala sat in silence. The food came. They began eating.</p><p>“This isn’t very good,” Gautama said.</p><p>“I don’t want to talk.”</p><p>He continued eating. He wondered what he should pay.</p><p>The meal ended. The manager came to their table and asked how they had enjoyed the food.</p><p>“It was very good,” Nirmala said. “We’ll come back.”</p><p>He put down a printout of all the items they had ordered. Gautama placed seventy dollars on top of it. This was all the money he had.</p><p>Outside, it was a cold February night. There were people waiting in lines to get into restaurants. Some of them were arm in arm. One couple walked in circles, laughing at how cold it was. As Gautama and Nirmala walked down the crowded sidewalk, Nirmala bumped into him. “Sorry,” Gautama said, not looking at her. After a few steps, she bumped into him again. He glanced at her.</p><p>“It’s over,” she said and laughed.</p><p>Gautama felt relieved that he had not embarrassed himself before Nirmala.</p><p>As he got to know her better, Nirmala began to seem more complicated to him. She told him that her father’s younger brother had “bothered” her. She didn’t say what he had done to bother her, but she said that, when her uncle was living with her family, she had begun pulling out her hair. “I get white hair where I used to pull it out,” she said.</p><p>The fact that this had happened to her made Gautama see her as being like any other person, someone with her own past, someone who needed love, who was scared and embarrassed, who had pulled out her own hair and was convinced that it turned white because of this.</p><p>The two started going on walks in the evening in the West Village, near Nirmala’s dorm. One day, they held hands for the first time. It was mid-March. The air was cold and heavy with moisture. They were walking past a pizza parlor, and Nirmala put her hand in his. The first thing Gautama noticed was the calluses on her palms. But, as soon as he had closed his hand around hers, he had the feeling that he would never need anything else. All the other things he worried about—his research, what job he would get, what might happen to his family in India—none of this mattered, because this thing was O.K.</p><p>He looked on YouTube for guidance on kissing. He watched a video in which an old white-haired couple kissed and then told each other what they had liked about the kiss.</p><p>French kissing seemed disrespectful. Kissing with closed lips had the bravery of kissing—a declaration of not caring what society thought—but was also not vulgar.</p><p>Every new thing that he and Nirmala did, such as standing on a street corner, each with a hand in the other’s back pocket, gave him a sense of freedom. They began lying together on her bed in her dorm room, kissing until he stopped being able to think. He would move her hand to his crotch, and she would move it away.</p><p>Gautama began looking at pornography again. He felt that if he did not ejaculate he would go mad. The first time he did this, sitting at his small wooden desk in his apartment, his laptop open before him, he immediately wondered why he had worried so much about doing it.</p><p>He began to find Nirmala incredibly beautiful. Her ears, small<span data-page="page_5"></span> with little diamond studs, appeared both modest and intelligent. When she spoke, her soft insistent voice resounded as if it were inside his own chest.</p><p>In early June, they decided to have sex. They removed their clothes and stood in Nirmala’s dorm room.</p><p>“Don’t look at me,” she said, holding her hands over her stomach.</p><p>He knelt down and kissed her belly.</p><p>“Does it smell bad?” she asked.</p><p>“No. Why?”</p><p>“I don’t know.”</p><p>In the days afterward, in the happiness of someone having chosen to have sex with him, he felt that he was growing more real, more substantial. Before, he had been only thoughts and emotions, and now he was becoming solid.</p><p>He found himself constantly thinking about Nirmala, how he teased her about her nervousness about her weight: “You are so small that you get lost in the bed.” He pictured some of the things they had done, him, half sitting, with her on top of him, telling her that she was not heavy, that she was like a little girl. To be able to be kind to someone you loved seemed a fortunate thing.</p><p>Until then, they had kept their involvement a secret. Once, at a Holi party, a large, dark-skinned woman from Hyderabad had begun praising Nirmala in front of Gautama, as if inviting him to join in. Gautama had immediately become suspicious that the woman might be a gossip, that if he were to say what he felt the woman would then tell others and the information might somehow make its way to India, where it could be used to embarrass Nirmala’s family.</p><p>But now Nirmala began introducing him to people as her boyfriend. This felt dangerous to Gautama, as if they were taking on a problem they could have avoided. He wondered whether Nirmala was doing this so that he could not back out. He decided that he did not want to think such a thing about her, that she was simply declaring her love to the world.</p><p>He and Nirmala began to be treated as a couple. People would ask him what hours she was working. Once, a woman came to him and wanted to know if Nirmala’s aunt in New Jersey was going to be visiting India soon, because she wanted to send a blood-pressure cuff to a relative. There was a strain to being known as a couple. One man advised him to propose in the morning; that way he and Nirmala would have the whole day to enjoy being engaged. At a party, he talked to a woman who was a new Ph.D. student, and one of Nirmala’s friends stood nearby glaring angrily at him.</p><p>Because Nirmala’s parents were bound to learn about him, it seemed important to tell his parents first, so that they might reach out to hers and keep them from feeling shame.</p><p>Gautama sat cross-legged on his futon bed and Skyped with his mother. She started crying. She wiped her eyes with a fold of her sari while his father’s legs paced behind her. They were contemplating the dowry they could have negotiated, Gautama assumed, the elation there would have been in finding a match for a son who was educated in America. “I blame you, not her,” his mother said, and from this he understood that all was not lost. His father shouted, “I blame her, too!”</p><p>Afterward, Gautama went to the refrigerator and stood by it drinking milk to ease his stomach.</p><p>In the next few days, he got calls from his sister, from his favorite cousin, from an uncle whom everybody in the family was scared of because he was a small-time politician and gangster. The tension of this was constant, and Gautama felt that he could not talk about it with Nirmala, because he had had sex with her, and so she had tied her fate to his.</p><p>Weeks went by, and then months. He periodically told his mother that she should talk to Nirmala, that Nirmala was a good girl. “When I have to drink that poison, I will,” she said.</p><p>Some things about Nirmala began to irritate him. If they went to a movie, she would take the tickets from his hand after he had purchased them. When they went to buy groceries, she would check that all the items on their list were in the cart, even though he had already crossed them out on the scrap of paper they were written on. To Gautama, this behavior seemed to come from Nirmala’s belief that if she were not in charge things would go wrong. Sometimes he wondered what he had started.</p><p>What bothered him most about Nirmala was that, if he was incorrect about something, she would point it out immediately. If he did the same to her, she became sullen. Once, he told her that the argument she was making about genetics was probably not correct. When he explained why he’d said this, she became angry and asked why he was in such a bad mood.</p><p>September came, and the university became busy again. The weather was still warm, and every afternoon two young women on Rollerblades performed in Washington Square Park. They wore white shorts and skated around the arch while playing trumpets. Gautama liked looking at these women so much that he would try always to be in Washington Square when they were there.</p><p>One<span data-page="page_final"></span> evening, almost a year after he was arrested, he sat at his desk and opened his laptop and went to Backpage. The screen filled with ads: lines of text, some words in bold, others capitalized, phone numbers written out as words. He felt as if he were floating, as if it were someone else’s finger clicking on an ad. A new screen opened: more text with images below, a Hispanic girl in a bikini, her face hidden by a flash, the picture taken in the bathroom mirror. Gautama recognized the photo from other ads he’d seen, and he suddenly became exhausted at the memory of calling prostitutes and then running away from his apartment. He shut down the computer.</p><p>A few days later, he came home and opened his laptop before he’d finished undressing. He sat on the edge of his futon and browsed through Backpage. He had his jeans at his ankles, and he remained that way for an hour.</p><p>The prostitute who walked into his apartment later that night was nineteen or twenty and black. She had white plastic beads in her hair. It was dark outside, and his studio’s wide window, divided into panes, was like a bank of TV screens in which the girl hung bright and tilted.</p><p>The girl stood at the center of the room, and Gautama’s heart pounded. Before she arrived, he had planned to tell her that she did not look like her photo and give her cab fare home. But she was much more beautiful than her photo, and he thought that the luck of getting someone so lovely might not occur again, and, since he would eventually end up having sex with a prostitute anyway, it was best not to waste this opportunity.</p><p>The girl was wearing a gray dress with thin blue horizontal stripes. Gautama handed her the money. He stepped away from her and again was amazed by her beauty.</p><p>“You’re pretty,” he said.</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>“Could you take off all your clothes?”</p><p>She pulled her dress over her head. She was slender with big breasts. She looked as if she had been Photoshopped. Folding the dress, she put it on his desk, which stood near the head of the bed. She came back to the center of the room.</p><p>“May I hold your breasts while you jump?”</p><p>The girl laughed. “Sure.”</p><p>She was smiling as he put his hands on her breasts. She started jumping. Her hair flew up, and the beads clicked. Her feet made soft thuds when she landed.</p><p>His hands on her breasts, Gautama became happier and happier. He knew that tomorrow he would feel guilt and shame, but he did not care. The girl jumped, and he had the sense that nobody else anywhere could be leading a life of such adventure and delight. ♦</p>	Akhil Sharma	May 16, 2016 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/05/16/a-life-of-adventure-and-delight-by-akhil-sharma	Books	Craigslist	Dating	Flirting	Graduate Students	Immigrants	Gautama 	Third	Immigrants
A Mistake	<p>As <span data-page="page_1"></span>far back as I can remember, my parents have bothered each other.</p><p>In India, we lived in two concrete rooms on the roof of a house. The bathroom stood separate from the living quarters. The sink was attached to one of the exterior walls. Each night, my father would stand before the sink, the sky above him full of stars, and brush his teeth until his gums bled. Then he would spit the blood into the sink and turn to my mother and say, “Death, Shuba, death. No matter what we do, we will all die.”</p><p>“Yes, yes, beat drums,” my mother said once. “Tell the newspapers, too. Make sure everyone knows this thing you have discovered.” Like many people of her generation, those born before Independence, my mother viewed gloom as unpatriotic. To complain was to show that you were not willing to accept difficulties, that you were not willing to do the hard work that was needed to build the country.</p><p>My father was only two years older than my mother. Unlike her, he saw dishonesty and selfishness everywhere. Not only did he see these things but he believed that everybody else did, too, and that people were deliberately not acknowledging what they saw.</p><p>My mother’s irritation at his spitting blood he interpreted as hypocrisy.</p><p>My father was an accountant. He had wanted to immigrate to the West ever since he was in his early twenties, ever since America liberalized its immigration policies in 1965. His wish rose out of self-loathing. Often when he walked down the street in Delhi, he would feel that the buildings he passed were indifferent to him, that he mattered so little to them that he might as well not have been born. Because he attributed this feeling to his circumstances—and not to the fact that he was the sort of person who sensed buildings’ having opinions—he believed that if he were somewhere else, especially somewhere where he was paid in dollars and thus was rich, he would be a different person and one whose life had meaning.</p><p>Another reason he wanted to emigrate was that he saw the West as glamorous with the excitement of science. In India in the fifties, sixties, and seventies, radios, televisions, and cars were not just expensive objects but seen as almost supernatural. I remember that when we turned on the radio in our apartment, as the vacuum tubes warmed up, first the voices would sound far away and then they would rush at us, and this was thrilling, as if the machine were making some special effort for us.</p><p>Of everybody in my family, my father loved science the most. He tried to bring it into his life by going to medical clinics and having his urine tested. He loved clinics and doctors’ offices. Of course, hypochondria had something to do with this; my father suspected that there was something wrong with him and that it might be something physical. Also, sitting in the clinics and talking to doctors in lab coats, he felt that he was close to important things, that what the doctors were doing was the same as what doctors would do in England or Germany or America, that he was already there in those foreign countries.</p><p>My mother had no interest in emigrating for herself. She was a high-school economics teacher, and she liked her job. But she thought that the West would provide me and my brother, Birju, with opportunities.</p><p>Then came the Emergency. Indira Gandhi suspended the Constitution and put thousands of politicians and journalists in jail. My parents, like almost everyone who had seen Independence come, were very loyal; they were the sort of people who looked up at a cloud and thought, That’s an Indian cloud. After the Emergency, however, they began to think that even though they were ordinary and unlikely to get into political trouble, it might still be better to emigrate.</p><p>I used to assume that my father had been assigned to us by the government. This was because he appeared to serve no purpose. When he got home in the evening, all he did was sit in his chair in the living room, drink tea, and read the paper. Often he looked angry. By the time we left for America, when I was eight and Birju was twelve, I knew that the government had not assigned him to live with us. Still, I continued to think that he served no purpose.</p><p>My father, who had gone to America a year before us, was waiting for us in the arrivals hall at the airport. He was leaning against a metal railing and looking irritated. The sight of him made me anxious.</p><p>The apartment he had rented was in a tall, brown brick building in Queens. The gray metal front door swung open into a foyer with a wooden floor. Beyond this was a living room with a reddish-brown carpet that went from wall to wall. I had never seen a carpet, except in movies. Birju and my parents walked across the foyer and into the living room. I went to the carpet’s edge and stopped. A brass strip held the carpet to the floor. I took a step forward, trying not to put my weight down. I felt as if I were stepping onto a painting.</p><p>My father took us to<span data-page="page_2"></span> the bathroom to show us toilet paper and hot water. Whereas my mother was interested in status—in being better educated than others or being considered more respectable—my father was simply interested in having more things. I think this was because while both of my parents had grown up poor, my father’s childhood had been more desperate. At some point, my father’s father had begun to believe that thorns were growing out of his palms. He had taken a razor and picked at his hands until they were shaggy with scraps of skin. Because of my grandfather’s problems, my father had grown up feeling that no matter what he did people would look down on him. As a result, he cared less about trying to convince people of his merits and more about just possessing things.</p><p>The bathroom was narrow. It had a tub, a sink, and a toilet in a row along one wall. My father reached between Birju and me and turned on the tap. Hot water came shaking and steaming into the basin. He stepped back and looked at us to gauge our reaction.</p><p>I had never seen hot water coming from a tap before. In India, in the winter, my mother used to get up early to heat pots of water on the stove so that we could bathe. Watching the hot water spill out, as if there were an endless supply, I had the sense of being in a fairy tale, one of those stories with a jug that is always full of milk or a bag of food that never empties.</p><p>That night, I went to bed on a mattress in the living room—the apartment had one bedroom, where my parents slept. Even in my sleep I was aware that I was in America. As the days passed, the wealth of this new country continued to astonish me. There were programs on television from morning until night. In our shiny brass mailbox in the lobby, we received ads on colored paper. The sliding glass doors of our apartment building would open when we approached. Each time they did this, I felt that we had been mistaken for somebody important.</p><p>My father, who had seemed pointless in India, had brought us to America and now we were rich. The fact that he had achieved this made him seem different, mysterious. All the time now he was saying things that revealed him as knowledgeable. In India, my mother had been the one who made all the decisions concerning Birju and me. Now I realized that my father, too, had opinions about us. This felt both surprising and intrusive, like being touched by a relative you don’t know well.</p><p>My father took Birju and me to a library. I had been in two libraries before then. One, in a small noisy room next to a barbershop, had had newspapers but not books and had been used primarily by people searching the employment ads. The other had been on the second floor of a temple, and had had books, but they were kept locked in glass-fronted cabinets.</p><p>The library in Queens was bigger than either of the ones I had seen. It had several rooms, and thousands of books. The librarian said that we could check out as many as we wanted. I did not believe this at first.</p><p>My father told Birju and me that he would give us fifty cents for each book we read. This bribing struck me as un-Indian and wrong. My mother had told us that Americans were afraid to demand things from their children. She’d said that this was because American parents did not care about their children and were unwilling to do the hard work of disciplining them. If my father wanted us to read, what he should do was threaten to beat us. I wondered whether my father had become too American during the year that he had lived alone.</p><p>I wanted to check out ten picture books. My father said, “You think I am going to give you money for such small books?”</p><p>My mother, Birju, and I had taken everything we could from the airplane: red Air India blankets, pillows with paper pillowcases, headsets, sachets of ketchup, packets of salt and pepper, airsickness bags. Birju and I used the blankets until they frayed and tore. Around that time, we started going to school.</p><p>I had a shy nature. “You are a tiger at home,” my mother said, “and a cat outside.” At school, I sat at the very back of the class, in the row closest to the door. Often I could not understand what my teacher was saying. I had studied English in India, but either my teacher spoke too quickly and used words I did not know or else I was so afraid that her words sounded garbled to my ears.</p><p>It was strange to be among so many whites. They all looked alike. When a boy spoke to me between periods, it would take me a moment to realize that I had talked to him before.</p><p>The school was three stories tall, with hallways that looped on themselves and stairways connecting the floors like a giant game of snakes and ladders. Not only could I not tell white people apart but I often got lost trying to find my classroom. Soon<span data-page="page_3"></span> I became so afraid of getting lost in the vastness of the school that I wouldn’t leave the classroom when I had to use the toilet.</p><p>We had lunch in an asphalt yard surrounded by a high chain-link fence. Wheeled garbage cans were spread around the yard. I was often bullied. Sometimes a little boy would come up to me and tell me that I smelled bad. Then, if I said anything, a bigger boy would appear so suddenly that I couldn’t tell where he had come from. He’d knock me down, then stand over me, fists clenched, and demand, “You want to fight? You want to fight?” Sometimes boys surrounded me and shoved me back and forth, keeping me upright as a kind of game.</p><p>Often, standing in a corner of the asphalt yard, I would think, There has been a mistake. I am good at cricket. I am good at marbles. I am not the sort of boy who is pushed around.</p><p>For me, the two best things about America were television and the library. Every Saturday night, I watched “The Love Boat.” I looked at the women in their one-piece bathing suits and their high heels and imagined what it would be like when I was married. I decided that when I was married I would be very serious, and my silences would lead to misunderstandings between me and my wife. We would have a fight and later make up and kiss. She would be wearing a white swimsuit as we kissed.</p><p>Before coming to America, I had never read a book just to read it. At first, when I began doing so, whatever I read seemed obviously a lie. If a book said that a boy walked into a room, I was immediately aware that there was no boy and there was no room. Still, I read so much that I began to imagine myself in the books I read. I imagined being Pinocchio, swallowed by a whale. I wished to be inside a whale with a candle burning on a wooden crate, as in the illustration. Vanishing into books, I felt held. While I was at school or walking down the street, there seemed no end to the world; when I read a book or watched “The Love Boat,” the world felt simple and understandable.</p><p>Birju liked America much more than I did. In India, he had not been very popular. Here he made friends quickly. He was in seventh grade and his English was better than mine. Also, he was kinder than he had been in India. In India, there had been such competition, so many people offering bribes to get their children slightly better grades, that he was always on edge. Here, doing well seemed as simple as studying.</p><p>My school was on the way to Birju’s and Birju used to walk me there every day. One morning, I started crying and told him about the bullying. He suggested that I talk to our parents. When I did not, he told them himself. My father came to school with me. I had to stand at the front of the class and point at all the boys who had shoved me or threatened me. After this, the bullying stopped. I had been angry that Birju had told our parents. I had not thought that this would make a difference. The fact that it did surprised me.</p><p>My mother took a job in a garment factory. The morning that she was to start, she came into the living room wearing jeans. I had never seen her in something form-fitting before. Birju and I were sitting on a mattress. “Your thighs look like turnips,” Birju said.</p><p>My mother started screaming, “Die, murderer, die!” Birju laughed and I laughed, too.</p><p>In India, when my father said that we should do something, we wouldn’t really start doing it until our mother had decided whether it should be done. In America, our parents had closer to equal authority. My father had all sorts of plans for us. Mostly, these involved ways to assimilate. He made us watch the news every evening. This was incredibly boring. We didn’t care that there were hostages in Iran or that there was a movie called “The Empire Strikes Back.” He also bought us tennis racquets and took us to Flushing Meadows Park. There, he made us hit tennis balls, because he believed that tennis was a sport for rich people.</p><p>My father was still irritable and suspicious, the way he had been in India, but he also had a certain confidence, as if no matter what happened he had done one thing that was uncontestably wonderful. “A green card is worth a million dollars,” he repeatedly told us.</p><p>My relationship with Birju also changed. In India, my mother had come home around the same time that we did. Now Birju was expected to take care of me until she returned from work. He was supposed to boil frozen corn for me and try to make me drink a glass of milk. Then he was supposed to sit with me and watch me do my homework while he did his. Before we came to America, I had not paid much attention to the fact that Birju was older than I was. I had thought that he was bigger,<span data-page="page_4"></span> but not more mature. Now I began to understand that Birju dealt with more complicated things than I did.</p><p>One thing he had to deal with was my father’s desire for him to attend the Bronx High School of Science, where the son of a colleague had been accepted. To get into the Bronx High School of Science, you had to pass a difficult entrance exam. Every evening, after he had finished his homework, Birju sat and went through study guides, preparing for the test. His studying seemed so important that it was as if he were carrying the fate of the entire family.</p><p>Birju and I were sent to spend the summer with our father’s older sister, in Arlington, Virginia. She and our uncle lived in a small white house beside a wide road. The houses in Arlington had yards. The damp air there smelled of earth and greenery. Among the most noticeable things about Arlington was that the television networks were on different channels than in Queens.</p><p>In Arlington, while I got to go out and play whenever I wanted to, Birju was not allowed to leave the house until he had studied for five hours. When we returned to Queens, his studying duties only increased. Instead of two hours every week night, he had to study three. He worked all day on weekends, stopping only when the 8 <em class="small">P.M.</em> TV shows started. Many nights, I fell asleep on my mattress to the sound of his pencil scratching away at our kitchen table.</p><p>Still, my mother felt that Birju was not studying hard enough. Often they fought. Once, she caught him asleep on the foam mattress in the room that my parents shared. He had claimed that he was going in there to study. Instead, she found him rolled onto his side, snoring.</p><p>She began shouting and called him a liar. Birju ran past her into the kitchen and returned with a knife. Standing before her, holding the knife by the handle and pointing it at his stomach, he said, “Kill me. Go ahead, kill me. I know that’s what you want.”</p><p>“Do some work instead of showing drama,” my mother said contemptuously.</p><p>The day of the exam finally came. On the subway to the test, I sat and Birju stood in front of me. I held one of his test-preparation books in my lap and checked his vocabulary. Most of the words I asked him he did not know. I started to panic. Birju, I began to see, was not going to do well. As I asked my questions and our mother and father listened, my voice grew quieter and quieter. I asked Birju what “rapscallion” meant. He guessed that it was a type of onion. When I told him what it was, he looked as if he were going to cry.</p><p>“Keep a calm head,” my father scolded.</p><p>“Don’t worry, baby,” my mother said. “You will remember when you need to.”</p><p>The exam took place in a large white cinder-block building that looked like a parking garage. As the test was going on, my parents and I walked back and forth on a sidewalk by a chain-link fence. The day was cold, gray, damp. Periodically, it drizzled. There were parked cars along the sidewalk, with waiting parents inside, and the windows of these cars grew foggy as we walked.</p><p>My father said, “These tests are for white people. How are we supposed to know what ‘pew’ means?”</p><p>“Don’t give me a headache,” my mother said. “I am worried enough.”</p><p>“Maybe he’ll do so well in the math and science portions that it will make up for the English.”</p><p>My stomach hurt. My chest was heavy. I had wanted Birju’s test day to come so that it would be over. Now that it was here, I wished that Birju had had more time.</p><p>Midway through the exam, there was a break. Birju came out to the sidewalk. He looked frightened. We surrounded him. We began feeding him oranges and almonds, to cool him and to give his brain strength.</p><p>“Just do your best,” my father said. “It is too late for anything else.”</p><p>Birju turned around and walked back toward the building.</p><p>Days went by. It was strange for Birju not to be studying. It was as if something were missing or wrong. Often Birju cried, “Mummy, I know I didn’t pass.”</p><p>A warm day came when I could tie my winter coat around my waist during lunch hour, then another one, like birds out of season. In Delhi, the fountains would be turned on in the evening and crowds would gather to watch.</p><p>Then the results arrived. Because Birju had said it so many times, I knew that an acceptance letter would come in a thick envelope, but the one Birju showed me was thin and white. Tears slid down his cheeks.</p><p>“Maybe you got in,” I murmured, trying to be comforting.</p><p>“Why do you think that?” Birju demanded angrily. He stared at me as if I might know something that he did not.</p><p>Our mother was at work. She had said that we shouldn’t open the envelope until she arrived, that we would take it to the temple and open it there.</p><p>My father arrived home after my mother. As soon as he did, Birju demanded that we<span data-page="page_5"></span> go to the temple.</p><p>Inside the large chamber, my mother put a dollar in the wooden box before God Shiva. Then we went to each of the idols in turn. Normally, we only pressed our hands together before each idol and bowed our heads. This time, we knelt and did a full prayer. After we had prayed before all the idols, we went back and knelt before the family of God Ram. Birju sat between our parents.</p><p>“You open it, Mummy.”</p><p>My mother tore off one side of the envelope. She shook out a sheet of paper. “Congratulations!” the letter began. Birju had made it!</p><p>“See. I told you we should open it at the temple.”</p><p>We all leaped to our feet and hugged.</p><p>With her arms still around Birju, my mother looked at me over his shoulder. “Tomorrow, we start preparing you,” she said.</p><p>We began to be invited to people’s houses for lunch, for dinner, for tea, so that Birju could meet these people’s children. Back then, because immigrants tended to be young, and the Indian immigration to America had only recently begun, there were very few Indian children Birju’s age, and other parents were always looking for role models.</p><p>We took the subway all over Queens, the Bronx, even to Manhattan. We travelled almost every weekend, and being asked to visit made my mother very happy.</p><p>“They have a girl they want you to marry,” she said once, to tease Birju.</p><p>“For me,” my father said, “there is one thing only.” He rubbed his thumb and forefinger together. “Dowry.” The enormous relief of Birju’s success had made my father cheerful as well.</p><p>Birju began to blush. “Leave me alone,” he said.</p><p>“Give me one egg at least, chicken. One egg only.”</p><p>“Don’t say that,” my mother said. “We are vegetarian. Say, ‘Give me some milk, lovely goat.’ ”</p><p>The triumph of getting into his school changed Birju. He sauntered. Entering a room, he appeared to be leaning back. When I spoke to him, he would look at me as if to ask how anyone could say something so foolish. One time when he looked at me this way, I blurted, “You have bad breath.” I felt foolish for having pitied him.</p><p>My mother acted as if everything Birju said were smart. One afternoon, as he sat tilting back in a chair at the kitchen table, one skinny arm reaching out to touch the wall so that he did not fall, he told our mother, “You should be a toll-booth collector.”</p><p>“Why?” She was standing by the stove, boiling frozen corn.</p><p>“In a toll booth, people will only see your top.”</p><p>My mother had been talking about trying to get a government job. She did not want to wear a uniform, though, because her hips embarrassed her.</p><p>She laughed and turned to me. “Your brother is a genius,” she said.</p><p>I wondered sometimes if my parents loved Birju more than they loved me. But I did not think so. They bothered him and corrected him so much more than they corrected me.</p><p>We went to Arlington again in the summer. By now, after two years in America, I had grown chubby. I could grip my belly and squeeze it. Birju was tall and thin. He had a little mustache and tendrils of hair on the sides of his cheeks.</p><p>Once more, I lay on my aunt’s sofa and watched TV. Once more, the TV channels were different from the ones in Queens, and they made me feel that I was living far from home.</p><p>Most days, Birju went swimming at a pool in a nearby apartment building. One afternoon in August, I was stretched out on the sofa watching “Gilligan’s Island” when the telephone rang. The shades were drawn and the room was dim. My aunt answered the phone. After she hung up, she came into the doorway. “Birju has had an accident,” she said. “Get up.” She motioned with a hand for me to rise. I went reluctantly. By the time we got back from the pool, “Gilligan’s Island” would likely be over.</p><p>The apartment building with the pool was tall and brown. There was a small parking lot beside the pool and an ambulance was stopped there, with a crowd of white people surrounding it. Being near so many whites made me nervous. Perhaps they would be angry at us for causing trouble. Birju should not have done whatever he had done.</p><p>My aunt said, “You wait.” She had arthritis in one hip and she pushed into the crowd with a lurching peg-leg gait.</p><p>I remained at the edge of the crowd and now, alone, I felt even more embarrassed. A minute passed and then two. My aunt came back, hobbling quickly. Her face looked scared.</p><p>“Go home,” she said. “I have to go to the hospital.”</p><p>I walked, head down, along the sidewalk. I was irritated. Birju had got into the Bronx High School of Science and now he was going to be in the hospital and our mother would feel bad for him and give him a gift.</p><p>As I walked, I wondered if Birju had stepped on a nail. I wondered if he was dead. This was thrilling. If he was dead, I would get to be the only son.</p><p>The sun pressed itself on me from above and also, its<span data-page="page_6"></span> heat reflecting off the sidewalk, from below. I thought I should probably cry. It seemed like the right thing to do.</p><p>I imagined myself alone in the house. I imagined Birju in the hospital and my aunt there. I imagined the fall, with Birju at the Bronx High School of Science and me at my ordinary school. Then the tears came.</p><p>Just as I had expected, “Gilligan’s Island” was over.</p><p>I lay back down on the sofa. I watched TV until five, when the news started. I picked up a book and propped it on my stomach. I read for a while, but I was aware that my aunt was gone and I was alone in the house. Something exciting was occurring. I felt as if I were missing out on an adventure.</p><p>Around eight, my uncle arrived, in his dark pants and short-sleeved shirt, with his triangle of wispy white hair. He stood by the sink, drinking water from a glass. He still had his shoes on. For him to be wearing shoes in the kitchen was so strange that it made the kitchen feel unreal, like a display in a furniture store.</p><p>“What’s happened?” I asked.</p><p>He patted my head. “We don’t know.”</p><p>About ten-thirty, my uncle drove us to the bus station. We were going to pick up my mother. The fact that my mother was coming made what had occurred seem very serious. I began to be scared.</p><p>When my mother walked through the bus station’s automatic doors, her hair was loose, her face flattened with fear. She was wearing a yellow sari and carrying a black duffelbag.</p><p>Seeing my mother, I worried that she might think I was bad for not crying. I walked up to her. She looked down, as if she didn’t recognize me. “Don’t worry,” I said. “I’ve cried already.”</p><p>The hospital room was bright and white and noisy. There was the whirr of the machines. There were beeps. There was a loud motorized rumble, almost like that of a generator.</p><p>Birju was lying on a bed with railings. The railings reminded me of a crib. There were poles on wheels all around the bed. Bags hung from the poles and there were also machines bolted to the poles. It was as if Birju were lying amid many clotheslines. He had a plastic mask over his mouth and nose. It looked like what fighter pilots wear in thin air. His eyes were wide open, as if in panic. He appeared to be staring up at some invisible thing that was pressing down on his chest.</p><p>Birju had dived into the swimming pool. He had struck his head on the pool’s concrete bottom and lain there stunned for three minutes. Water had surged down his throat and into his lungs. His lungs had peeled away from the insides of his chest.</p><p>My uncle carried a large cardboard box into the room that Birju and I had shared, and placed it against a wall. My aunt and my mother draped a white sheet over the box. They taped postcards of various gods on the wall, so that these appeared to be gazing at the altar. On the altar itself, they placed a spoon and, in the bowl of the spoon, a wick soaked in clarified butter. They put a wad of dough on the altar and stuck incense sticks into the dough. They did all this quickly and quietly. When they spoke, it was in a whisper.</p><p>The ceiling lights were turned off. The flame in the spoon and the smoke rising from it sent shadows shaking over the walls. I lay on a strip of foam beneath one of the windows. My aunt and my mother stretched themselves face down before the altar. They sang prayers. I kept being woken by their singing. I understood that it was proper to pray in moments like this. Still, I knew that Birju was going to be all right and wouldn’t it be better for everyone to get some sleep?</p><p>Around 4 <em class="small">A.M</em>., the ceiling lights were turned on. I sat up. The air was thick with incense. My mother was standing before the altar, her hands pressed together. She was wearing a blue silk sari and a gold necklace, and she looked as if she were going to a wedding.</p><p>A little later, when we were about to go back to the hospital, we stood in the driveway in the dark. I looked up at the stars. There were thousands of them, some of them bright, some of them dim. I suddenly had the sense that what was happening was a mistake, that we had been given somebody else’s life.</p><p>In the weeks that followed, I spent most of each day sitting by Birju’s bed, chanting to him from the Ramayana. The book was a large hardcover wrapped in saffron cloth. Some of the pages had grease stains from the butter used in prayers, and I could look through the stains and see the letters on the next page. Every time I opened the book, there was a puff of incense smell from its having spent so many years near altars.</p><p>I had never prayed so much before, every day, hour after hour, until my throat ached and even my tongue and my gums hurt. I had<span data-page="page_final"></span> not believed in God before. Now, praying as if it were my job, I began to think that there had to be a God. People weren’t stupid. My mother wouldn’t be making me pray this way, people all over the world wouldn’t be building temples and going on pilgrimages, if there weren’t some benefit to it. It was strange that there was a God. I imagined that He was far away, busy, impatient, not especially interested in the many people who wanted His help, but obligated for some reason to hear our prayers.</p><p>Time passed. I watched my mother cut Birju’s fingernails. She seemed scared to do it. “Is this all right?” she asked him. I watched her and felt as if I were dreaming.</p><p>Birju had his oxygen mask removed. Many of the wheeled poles were taken away. Now he looked the way he always had, except that he seemed to be sleeping with his eyes open. A doctor told us that oxygen deprivation had destroyed his corneas and he couldn’t see. It seemed disloyal to believe this.</p><p>Birju moaned, he yawned, he coughed, but his eyes were like those of a blind person, lost in thought. He responded to sounds. If there was a loud noise, he would turn his head in the direction of the noise. Then he’d roll it back and just lie there. Occasionally, he had a seizure. His teeth clamped shut and squeaked against each other. His body stiffened, his hips rose off the bed, and the bed began to rattle. Often, standing by the bed and reading to him, or holding a comic book open before him and saying, “See,” I felt such love for my brother that I wished I had known all along how much he mattered to me. I looked at him through the railings and wondered what to do. ♦</p>	Akhil Sharma	January 20, 2014 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/01/20/a-mistake	Accidents	Books	Brain Damage	Brothers	Bullying	Fathers	Unnamed	First	Immigrants
A Sheltered Woman	<p>The <span data-page="page_1"></span>new mother, groggy from a nap, sat at the table as though she did not grasp why she had been summoned. Perhaps she never would, Auntie Mei thought. On the placemat sat a bowl of soybean-and-pig’s-foot soup that Auntie Mei had cooked, as she had for many new mothers before this one. <em>Many</em>, however, was not exact. In her interviews with potential employers, Auntie Mei always gave the precise number of families she had worked for: a hundred and twenty-six when she interviewed with her current employer, a hundred and thirty-one babies altogether. The families’ contact information, the dates she had worked for them, their babies’ names and birthdays—these she had recorded in a palm-size notebook, which had twice fallen apart and been taped back together. Years ago, Auntie Mei had bought it at a garage sale in Moline, Illinois. She had liked the picture of flowers on the cover, purple and yellow, unmelted snow surrounding the chaste petals. She had liked the price of the notebook, too: five cents. When she handed a dime to the child with the cash box on his lap, she asked if there was another notebook she could buy, so that he would not have to give her any change; the boy looked perplexed and said no. It was greed that had made her ask, but when the memory came back—it often did when she took the notebook out of her suitcase for another interview—Auntie Mei would laugh at herself: why on earth had she wanted two notebooks, when there’s not enough life to fill one?</p><p>The mother sat still, not touching the spoon, until teardrops fell into the steaming soup.</p><p>“Now, now,” Auntie Mei said. She was pushing herself and the baby in a new rocking chair—back and forth, back and forth, the squeaking less noticeable than yesterday. I wonder who’s enjoying the rocking more, she said to herself: the chair, whose job is to rock until it breaks apart, or you, whose life is being rocked away? And which one of you will meet your demise first? Auntie Mei had long ago accepted that she had, despite her best intentions, become one of those people who talk to themselves when the world is not listening. At least she took care not to let the words slip out.</p><p>“I don’t like this soup,” said the mother, who surely had a Chinese name but had asked Auntie Mei to call her Chanel. Auntie Mei, however, called every mother Baby’s Ma, and every infant Baby. It was simple that way, one set of clients easily replaced by the next.</p><p>“It’s not for you to like,” Auntie Mei said. The soup had simmered all morning and had thickened to a milky white. She would never have touched it herself, but it was the best recipe for breast-feeding mothers. “You eat it for Baby.”</p><p>“Why do I have to eat for him?” Chanel said. She was skinny, though it had been only five days since the delivery.</p><p>“Why, indeed,” Auntie Mei said, laughing. “Where else do you think your milk comes from?”</p><p>“I’m not a cow.”</p><p>I would rather you were a cow, Auntie Mei thought. But she merely threatened gently that there was always the option of formula. Auntie Mei wouldn’t mind that, but most people hired her for her expertise in taking care of newborns and breast-feeding mothers.</p><p>The young woman started to sob. Really, Auntie Mei thought, she had never seen anyone so unfit to be a mother as this little creature.</p><p>“I think I have postpartum depression,” Chanel said when her tears had stopped.</p><p>Some fancy term the young woman had picked up.</p><p>“My great-grandmother hanged herself when my grandfather was three days old. People said she’d fallen under the spell of some passing ghost, but this is what I think.” Using her iPhone as a mirror, Chanel checked her face and pressed her puffy eyelids with a finger. “She had postpartum depression.”</p><p>Auntie Mei stopped rocking and snuggled the infant closer. At once his head started bumping against her bosom. “Don’t speak nonsense,” she said sternly.</p><p>“I’m only explaining what postpartum depression is.”</p><p>“Your problem is that you’re not eating. Nobody would be happy if they were in your shoes.”</p><p>“Nobody,” Chanel said glumly, “could possibly be in my shoes. Do you know what I dreamed last night?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Take a guess.”</p><p>“In our village, we say it’s bad luck to guess someone else’s dreams,” Auntie Mei said. Only ghosts entered and left people’s minds freely.</p><p>“I dreamed that I flushed Baby down the toilet.”</p><p>“Oh. I wouldn’t have guessed that even if I’d tried.”</p><p>“That’s the problem. Nobody knows how I feel,” Chanel said, and started to weep again.</p><p>Auntie Mei sniffed under the child’s blanket, paying no heed to the fresh tears. “Baby needs a diaper change,” she announced, knowing that, given some time, Chanel would acquiesce: a mother is a mother, even if she speaks of flushing her child down the drain.</p><p>Auntie Mei had worked as a live-in nanny for newborns and their mothers for eleven years. As a rule, she moved out of the family’s house the day a baby turned a month old, unless—though this rarely happened—she was between jobs, which was never more than a few days. Many families would have been glad to pay her extra for another week, or another<span data-page="page_2"></span> month; some even offered a longer term, but Auntie Mei always declined: she worked as a first-month nanny, whose duties, toward both the mother and the infant, were different from those of a regular nanny. Once in a while, she was approached by previous employers to care for their second child. The thought of facing a child who had once been an infant in her arms led to lost sleep; she agreed only when there was no other option, and she treated the older children as though they were empty air.</p><p>Between bouts of sobbing, Chanel said she did not understand why her husband couldn’t take a few days off. The previous day he had left for Shenzhen on a business trip. “What right does he have to leave me alone with his son?”</p><p>Alone? Auntie Mei squinted at Baby’s eyebrows, knitted so tight that the skin in between took on a tinge of yellow. Your pa is working hard so your ma can stay home and call me nobody. The Year of the Snake, an inauspicious one to give birth in, had been slow for Auntie Mei; otherwise, she would’ve had better options. She had not liked the couple when she met them; unlike most expectant parents, they had both looked distracted, and asked few questions before offering her the position. They were about to entrust their baby to a stranger, Auntie Mei had wanted to remind them, but neither seemed worried. Perhaps they had gathered enough references? Auntie Mei did have a reputation as a gold-medal nanny. Her employers were the lucky ones, to have had a good education in China and, later, America, and to have become professionals in the Bay Area: lawyers, doctors, V.C.s, engineers—no matter, they still needed an experienced Chinese nanny for their American-born babies. Many families lined her up months before their babies were born.</p><p>Baby, cleaned and swaddled, seemed satisfied, so Auntie Mei left him on the changing table and looked out the window, enjoying, as she always did, a view that did not belong to her. Between an azalea bush and a slate path, there was a man-made pond, which hosted an assortment of goldfish and lily pads. Before he left, the husband had asked Auntie Mei to feed the fish and refill the pond. Eighteen hundred gallons a year, he had informed her, calculating the expense. She would have refused the additional responsibilities if not for his readiness to pay her an extra twenty dollars each day.</p><p>A statue of an egret, balanced on one leg, stood in the water, its neck curved into a question mark. Auntie Mei thought about the man who had made the sculpture. Of course, it could have been a woman, but Auntie Mei refused to accept that possibility. She liked to believe that it was men who made beautiful and useless things like the egret. Let him be a lonely man, beyond the reach of any fiendish woman.</p><p>Baby started to wiggle. Don’t you stir before your ma finishes her soup, Auntie Mei warned in a whisper, though in vain. The egret, startled, took off with an unhurried elegance, its single squawk stunning Auntie Mei and then making her laugh. For sure, you’re getting old and forgetful: there was no such statue yesterday. Auntie Mei picked up Baby and went into the yard. There were fewer goldfish now, but at least some had escaped the egret’s raid. All the same, she would have to tell Chanel about the loss. You think you have a problem with postpartum depression? Think of the goldfish, living one day in a paradise pond and the next day going to Heaven in the stomach of a passing egret.</p><p>Auntie Mei believed in strict routines for every baby and mother in her charge. For the first week, she fed the mother six meals a day, with three snacks in between; from the second week on, it was four meals and two snacks. The baby was to be nursed every two hours during the day, and every three or four hours at night. She let the parents decide whether the crib was kept in their bedroom or in the nursery, but she would not allow it in her bedroom. No, this was not for her convenience, she explained to them; there was simply no reason for a baby to be close to someone who was there for only a month.</p><p>“But it’s impossible to eat so much. People are different,” Chanel said the next day. Less weepy at the moment, she was curled up on the sofa, a pair of heating pads on her chest: Auntie Mei had not been impressed with the young woman’s milk production.</p><p>You can be as different as you want after I leave, Auntie Mei thought as she bathed Baby; your son can grow into a lopsided squash and I won’t care a bit. But no mother or baby could deviate just yet. The reason people hired a first-month nanny, Auntie Mei told Chanel, was to make sure that things went correctly, not differently.</p><p>“But did you follow this schedule when you had your children? I bet you didn’t.”</p><p>“As a matter of fact, I didn’t, only because I didn’t have children.”</p><p>“Not even one?”</p><p>“You didn’t specify a nanny who had her own children.”</p><p>“But why would you . . . why did you<span data-page="page_3"></span> choose this line of work?”</p><p>Why indeed. “Sometimes a job chooses you,” Auntie Mei said. Ha, who knew she could be so profound?</p><p>“But you must love children, then?”</p><p>Oh, no, no, not this one or that one; not any of them. “Does a bricklayer love his bricks?” Auntie Mei asked. “Does the dishwasher repairman love the dishwashers?” That morning, a man had come to look at Chanel’s malfunctioning dishwasher. It had taken him only twenty minutes of poking, but the bill was a hundred dollars, as much as a whole day’s wages for Auntie Mei.</p><p>“Auntie, that’s not a good argument.”</p><p>“My job doesn’t require me to argue well. If I could argue, I’d have become a lawyer, like your husband, no?”</p><p>Chanel made a mirthless laughing sound. Despite her self-diagnosed depression, she seemed to enjoy talking with Auntie Mei more than most mothers, who talked to her about their babies and their breast-feeding but otherwise had little interest in her. [cartoon id="a18067"]</p><p>Auntie Mei put Baby on the sofa next to Chanel, who was unwilling to make room. “Now, let’s look into this milk situation,” Auntie Mei said, rubbing her hands until they were warm before removing the heating pads. Chanel cried out in pain.</p><p>“I haven’t even touched you.”</p><p>Look at your eyes, Auntie Mei wanted to say. Not even a good plumber could fix such a leak.</p><p>“I don’t want to nurse this thing anymore,” Chanel said.</p><p>This thing? “He’s your son.”</p><p>“His father’s, too. Why can’t he be here to help?”</p><p>“Men don’t make milk.”</p><p>Chanel laughed, despite her tears. “No. The only thing they make is money.”</p><p>“You’re lucky to have found one who makes money. Not all of them do, you know.”</p><p>Chanel dried her eyes carefully with the inside of her pajama sleeve. “Auntie, are you married?”</p><p>“Once,” Auntie Mei said.</p><p>“What happened? Did you divorce him?”</p><p>“He died,” Auntie Mei said. She had, every day of her marriage, wished that her husband would stop being part of her life, though not in so absolute a manner. Now, years later, she still felt responsible for his death, as though it were she, and not a group of teen-agers, who had accosted him that night. Why didn’t you just let them take the money? Sometimes Auntie Mei scolded him when she tired of talking to herself. Thirty-five dollars for a life, three months short of fifty-two.</p><p>“Was he much older than you?”</p><p>“Older, yes, but not too old.”</p><p>“My husband is twenty-eight years older than I am,” Chanel said. “I bet you didn’t guess that.”</p><p>“No, I didn’t.”</p><p>“Is it that I look old or that he looks young?”</p><p>“You look like a good match.”</p><p>“Still, he’ll probably die before me, right? Women live longer than men, and he’s had a head start.”</p><p>So you, too, are eager to be freed. Let me tell you, it’s bad enough when a wish like that doesn’t come true, but, if it ever does, that’s when you know that living is a most disappointing business: the world is not a bright place to start with, but a senseless wish granted senselessly makes it much dimmer. “Don’t speak nonsense,” Auntie Mei said.</p><p>“I’m only stating the truth. How did your husband die? Was it a heart attack?”</p><p>“You could say that,” Auntie Mei said, and before Chanel could ask more questions Auntie Mei grabbed one of her erring breasts. Chanel gasped and then screamed. Auntie Mei did not let go until she’d given the breast a forceful massage. When she reached for the other breast, Chanel screamed louder but did not change her position, for fear of crushing Baby, perhaps.</p><p>Afterward, Auntie Mei brought a warm towel. “Go,” Chanel said. “I don’t want you here anymore.”</p><p>“But who’ll take care of you?”</p><p>“I don’t need anyone to take care of me.” Chanel stood up and belted her robe.</p><p>“And Baby?”</p><p>“Bad luck for him.”</p><p>Chanel walked to the staircase, her back defiantly rigid. Auntie Mei picked up Baby, his weight as insignificant as the emotions—sadness, anger, or dismay—that she should feel on his behalf. Rather, Auntie Mei was in awe of the young woman. That is how, Auntie Mei said to herself, a mother orphans a child.</p><p>Baby, six days old that day, was weaned from his mother’s breast. Auntie Mei was now the sole person to provide him with food and care and—this she did not want to admit even to herself—love. Chanel stayed in her bedroom and watched Chinese television dramas all afternoon. Once in a while, she came downstairs for water, and spoke to Auntie Mei as though the old woman and the infant were poor relations: there was the inconvenience of having them to stay, and yet there was relief that they did not have to be entertained.</p><p>The dishwasher repairman returned in the evening. He reminded Auntie Mei that his name was Paul. As though she were so old that she could forget it in a day, she thought. Earlier, she had told him about the thieving egret, and he had promised to come back and fix the problem.</p><p>“You’re sure the bird won’t be killed,” Auntie Mei said as she watched Paul rig some wires above the pond.</p><p>“Try it yourself,” Paul said, flipping the battery switch.</p><p>Auntie Mei placed her palm on the crisscrossed wires. “I feel nothing.”</p><p>“Good.<span data-page="page_4"></span> If you felt something, I’d be putting your life at risk. Then you could sue me.”</p><p>“But how does it work?”</p><p>“Let’s hope the egret is more sensitive than you are,” Paul said. “Call me if it doesn’t work. I won’t charge you again.”</p><p>Auntie Mei felt doubtful, but her questioning silence did not stop him from admiring his own invention. Nothing, he said, is too difficult for a thinking man. When he put away his tools he lingered on, and she could see that there was no reason for him to hurry home. He had grown up in Vietnam, he told Auntie Mei, and had come to America thirty-seven years ago. He was widowed, with three grown children, and none of them had given him a grandchild, or the hope of one. His two sisters, both living in New York and both younger, had beaten him at becoming grandparents.</p><p>The same old story: they all had to come from somewhere, and they all accumulated people along the way. Auntie Mei could see the unfolding of Paul’s life: he’d work his days away till he was too old to be useful, then his children would deposit him in a facility and visit on his birthday and on holidays. Auntie Mei, herself an untethered woman, felt superior to him. She raised Baby’s tiny fist as Paul was leaving. “Say bye-bye to Grandpa Paul.”</p><p>Auntie Mei turned and looked up at the house. Chanel was leaning on the windowsill of her second-floor bedroom. “Is he going to electrocute the egret?” she called down.</p><p>“He said it would only zap the bird. To teach it a lesson.”</p><p>“You know what I hate about people? They like to say, ‘That will teach you a lesson.’ But what’s the point of a lesson? There’s no makeup exam when you fail something in life.”</p><p>It was October, and the evening air from the Bay had a chill to it. Auntie Mei had nothing to say except to warn Chanel not to catch a cold.</p><p>“Who cares?”</p><p>“Maybe your parents do.”</p><p>Chanel made a dismissive noise.</p><p>“Or your husband.”</p><p>“Ha. He just e-mailed and told me he had to stay for another ten days,” Chanel said. “You know what I think he’s doing right now? Sleeping with a woman, or more than one.”</p><p>Auntie Mei did not reply. It was her policy not to disparage an employer behind his back. But when she entered the house Chanel was already in the living room. “I think you should know he’s not the kind of person you thought he was.”</p><p>“I don’t think he’s any kind of person at all,” Auntie Mei said.</p><p>“You never say a bad word about him,” Chanel said.</p><p>Not a good word, either.</p><p>“He had a wife and two children before.”</p><p>You think a man, any man, would remain a bachelor until he meets you? Auntie Mei put the slip of paper with Paul’s number in her pocket.</p><p>“Did that man leave you his number?” Chanel said. “Is he courting you?”</p><p>“Him? Half of him, if not more, is already in the coffin.”</p><p>“Men chase after women until the last moment,” Chanel said. “Auntie, don’t fall for him. No man is to be trusted.”</p><p>Auntie Mei sighed. “If Baby’s Pa is not coming home, who’s going to shop for groceries?”</p><p>The man of the house postponed his return; Chanel refused to have anything to do with Baby. Against her rules, Auntie Mei moved his crib into her bedroom; against her rules, too, she took on the responsibility of grocery shopping.</p><p>“Do you suppose people will think we’re the grandparents of this baby?” Paul asked after inching the car into a tight spot between two S.U.V.s.</p><p>Could it be that he had agreed to drive and help with shopping for a reason other than the money Auntie Mei had promised him? “Nobody,” she said, handing a list to Paul, “will think anything. Baby and I will wait here in the car.”</p><p>“You’re not coming in?”</p><p>“He’s a brand-new baby. You think I would bring him into a store with a bunch of refrigerators?”</p><p>“You should’ve left him home, then.”</p><p>With whom? Auntie Mei worried that, had she left Baby home, he would be gone from the world when she returned, though this fear she would not share with Paul. She explained that Baby’s Ma suffered from postpartum depression and was in no shape to take care of him.</p><p>“You should’ve just given me the shopping list,” Paul said.</p><p>What if you ran off with the money without delivering the groceries? she thought, though it was unfair of her. There were men she knew she could trust, including, even, her dead husband.</p><p>On the drive back, Paul asked if the egret had returned. She hadn’t noticed, Auntie Mei replied. She wondered if she would have an opportunity to see the bird be taught its lesson: she had only twenty-two days left. Twenty-two days, and then the next family would pluck her out of here, egret or no egret. Auntie Mei turned to look at Baby, who was asleep in the car seat. “What will become of you then?” she said.</p><p>“Me?” Paul asked.</p><p>“Not you. Baby.”</p><p>“Why do you worry? He’ll have a good life. Better than mine. Better than yours, for sure.”</p><p>“You don’t know my life to say that,” Auntie Mei said.</p><p>“I<span data-page="page_5"></span> can imagine. You should find someone. This is not a good life for you, going from one house to another and never settling down.”</p><p>“What’s wrong with that? I don’t pay rent. I don’t have to buy my own food.”</p><p>“What’s the point of making money if you don’t spend it?” Paul said. “I’m at least saving money for my future grandchildren.”</p><p>“What I do with my money,” Auntie Mei said, “is none of your business. Now, please pay attention to the road.”</p><p>Paul, chastened into a rare silence, drove on, the slowest car on the freeway. Perhaps he’d meant well, but there were plenty of well-meaning men, and she was one of those women who made such men suffer. If Paul wanted to hear stories, she could tell him one or two, and spare him any hope of winning her affection. But where would she start? With the man she had married without any intention of loving and had wished into an early grave, or with the father she had not met because her mother had made his absolute absence a condition of her birth? Or perhaps she should start with her grandmother, who vanished from her own daughter’s crib side one day, only to show up twenty-five years later when her husband was dying from a wasting illness. The disappearance would have made sense had Auntie Mei’s grandfather been a villain, but he had been a kind man, and had raised his daughter alone, clinging to the hope that his wife, having left without a word, would return.</p><p>Auntie Mei’s grandmother had not gone far: all those years, she had stayed in the same village, living with another man, hiding in his attic during the day, sneaking out of the house in the middle of the night for a change of air. Nobody was able to understand why she had not gone on hiding until after her husband’s death. She explained that it was her wifely duty to see her husband off properly. [cartoon id="a18071"]</p><p>Auntie Mei’s mother, newly married and with a prospering business as a seamstress, was said to have accepted one parent’s return and the other’s death with equanimity, but the next year, pregnant with her first and only child, she made her husband leave by threatening to drink a bottle of DDT.</p><p>Auntie Mei had been raised by two mythic women. The villagers had shunned the two women, but they had welcomed the girl as one of them. Behind closed doors, they had told her about her grandfather and her father, and in their eyes she had seen their fearful disapproval of her elders: her pale-skinned grandmother, unused to daylight after years of darkness, had carried on her nocturnal habits, cooking and knitting for her daughter and granddaughter in the middle of the night; her mother, eating barely enough, had slowly starved herself to death, yet she never tired of watching, with an unblinking intensity, her daughter eat.</p><p>Auntie Mei had not thought of leaving home until the two women died, her mother first, and then her grandmother. They had been sheltered from worldly reproach by their peculiarities when alive; in death, they took with them their habitat, and left nothing to anchor Auntie Mei. A marriage offer, arranged by the distant cousin of a man in Queens, New York, had been accepted without hesitation: in a new country, her grandmother and her mother would cease to be legendary. Auntie Mei had not told her husband about them; he would not have been interested, in any case—silly good man, wanting only a hardworking woman to share a solid life. Auntie Mei turned to look at Paul. Perhaps he was not so different from her husband, her father, her grandfather, or even the man her grandmother had lived with for years but never returned to after the death of Auntie Mei’s grandfather: ordinary happiness, uncomplicated by the women in their lives, was their due.</p><p>“You think, by any chance, you’ll be free tomorrow afternoon?” Paul asked when he’d parked the car in front of Chanel’s house.</p><p>“I work all day, as you know.”</p><p>“You could bring Baby, like you did today.”</p><p>“To where?”</p><p>Paul said that there was this man who played chess every Sunday afternoon at East-West Plaza Park. Paul wanted to take a walk with Auntie Mei and Baby nearby.</p><p>Auntie Mei laughed. “Why, so he’ll get distracted and lose the game?”</p><p>“I want him to think I’ve done better than him.”</p><p>Better how? With a borrowed lady friend pushing a borrowed grandson in a stroller? “Who is he?”</p><p>“Nobody important. I haven’t talked to him for twenty-seven years.”</p><p>He couldn’t even lie well. “And you still think he’d fall for your trick?”</p><p>“I know him.”</p><p>Auntie Mei wondered if knowing someone—a friend, an enemy—was like never letting that person out of one’s sight. Being known, then, must not be far from being imprisoned by someone else’s thought. In that sense, her grandmother and her mother had been fortunate: no one could claim to have known them, not even Auntie Mei. When she was younger, she had seen no point in understanding them, as she had been told they were beyond apprehension. After their deaths, they had become abstract. Not knowing them, Auntie Mei, too, had the good fortune of not wanting to know anyone who came after: her husband; her co-workers at<span data-page="page_6"></span> various Chinese restaurants during her yearlong migration from New York to San Francisco; the babies and the mothers she took care of, who had become only recorded names in her notebook. “I’d say let it go,” Auntie Mei told Paul. “What kind of grudge is worthy of twenty-seven years?”</p><p>Paul sighed. “If I tell you the story, you’ll understand.”</p><p>“Please,” Auntie Mei said. “Don’t tell me any story.”</p><p>From the second-floor landing, Chanel watched Paul put the groceries in the refrigerator and Auntie Mei warm up a bottle of formula. Only after he’d left did Chanel call down to ask how their date had gone. Auntie Mei held Baby in the rocking chair; the joy of watching him eat was enough of a compensation for his mother’s being a nuisance.</p><p>Chanel came downstairs and sat on the sofa. “I saw you pull up. You stayed in the car for a long time,” she said. “I didn’t know an old man could be so romantic.”</p><p>Auntie Mei thought of taking Baby into her bedroom, but this was not her house, and she knew that Chanel, in a mood to talk, would follow her. When Auntie Mei remained quiet, Chanel said that her husband had called earlier, and she had told him that his son had gone out to witness a couple carry on a <em>sunset affair</em>.</p><p>You should walk out right this minute, Auntie Mei said to herself, but her body settled into the rhythm of the rocking chair, back and forth, back and forth.</p><p>“Are you angry, Auntie?”</p><p>“What did your husband say?”</p><p>“He was upset, of course, and I told him that’s what he gets for not coming home.”</p><p>What’s stopping you from leaving? Auntie Mei asked herself. You want to believe you’re staying for Baby, don’t you?</p><p>“You should be happy for me that he’s upset,” Chanel said. “Or at least happy for Baby, no?”</p><p>I’m happy that, like everyone else, you’ll all become the past soon.</p><p>“Why are you so quiet, Auntie? I’m sorry I’m such a pain, but I don’t have a friend here, and you’ve been nice to me. Would you please take care of me and Baby?”</p><p>“You’re paying me,” Auntie Mei said. “So of course I’ll take care of you.”</p><p>“Will you be able to stay on after this month?” Chanel asked. “I’ll pay double.”</p><p>“I don’t work as a regular nanny.”</p><p>“But what would we do without you, Auntie?”</p><p>Don’t let this young woman’s sweet voice deceive you, Auntie Mei warned herself: you’re not irreplaceable—not for her, not for Baby, not for anyone. Still, Auntie Mei fancied for a moment that she could watch Baby grow—a few months, a year, two years. “When is Baby’s Pa coming home?”</p><p>“He’ll come home when he comes.”</p><p>Auntie Mei cleaned Baby’s face with the corner of a towel.</p><p>“I know what you’re thinking—that I didn’t choose the right man. Do you want to know how I came to marry someone so old and irresponsible?”</p><p>“I don’t, as a matter of fact.”</p><p>All the same, they told Auntie Mei stories, not heeding her protests. The man who played chess every Sunday afternoon came from the same village as Paul’s wife, and had long ago been pointed out to him by her as a potentially better husband. Perhaps she had said it only once, out of an impulse to sting Paul, or perhaps she had tormented him for years with her approval of a former suitor. Paul did not say, and Auntie Mei did not ask. Instead, he had measured his career against the man’s: Paul had become a real professional; the man had stayed a laborer.</p><p>An enemy could be as eternally close as a friend; a feud could make two men brothers for life. Fortunate are those for whom everyone can be turned into a stranger, Auntie Mei thought, but this wisdom she did not share with Paul. He had wanted her only to listen, and she had obliged him.</p><p>Chanel, giving more details, and making Auntie blush at times, was a better storyteller. She had slept with an older married man to punish her father, who had himself pursued a young woman, in this case one of Chanel’s college classmates. The pregnancy was meant to punish her father, too, but also the man, who, like her father, had cheated on his wife. “He didn’t know who I was at first. I made up a story so that he thought I was one of those girls he could sleep with and then pay off,” Chanel had said. “But then he realized he had no choice but to marry me. My father has enough connections to destroy his business.”</p><p>Had she not thought how this would make her mother feel? Auntie Mei asked. Why should she? Chanel replied. A woman who could not keep the heart of her man was not a good model for a daughter.</p><p>Auntie Mei did not understand their logic: Chanel’s depraved; Paul’s unbending. What a world you’ve been born into, Auntie Mei said to Baby now. It was past midnight, the lamp in her bedroom turned off. The night-light of swimming ocean animals on the crib streaked Baby’s face blue and orange. There must have been a time when her mother had sat with her by candlelight, or else her grandmother might have been there in the darkness. What<span data-page="page_final"></span> kind of future had they wished for her? She had been brought up in two worlds: the world of her grandmother and her mother, and that of everyone else; each world had sheltered her from the other, and to lose one was to be turned, against her wish, into a permanent resident of the other.</p><p>Auntie Mei came from a line of women who could not understand themselves, and in not knowing themselves they had derailed their men and orphaned their children. At least Auntie Mei had had the sense not to have a child, though sometimes, during a sleepless night like this one, she entertained the thought of slipping away with a baby she could love. The world was vast; there had to be a place for a woman to raise a child as she wished.</p><p>The babies—a hundred and thirty-one of them, and their parents, trusting yet vigilant—had protected Auntie Mei from herself. But who was going to protect her now? Not this baby, who was as defenseless as the others, yet she must protect him. From whom, though: his parents, who had no place for him in their hearts, or Auntie Mei, who had begun to imagine his life beyond the one month allocated to her?</p><p>See, this is what you get for sitting up and muddling your head. Soon you’ll become a tiresome oldster like Paul, or a lonely woman like Chanel, telling stories to any available ear. You can go on talking and thinking about your mother and your grandmother and all those women before them, but the problem is, you don’t know them. If knowing someone makes that person stay with you forever, not knowing someone does the same trick: death does not take the dead away; it only makes them grow more deeply into you.</p><p>No one would be able to stop her if she picked up Baby and walked out the door. She could turn herself into her grandmother, for whom sleep had become optional in the end; she could turn herself into her mother, too, eating little because it was Baby who needed nourishment. She could become a fugitive from this world that had kept her for too long, but this urge, coming as it often did in waves, no longer frightened her, as it had years ago. She was getting older, more forgetful, yet she was also closer to comprehending the danger of being herself. She had, unlike her mother and her grandmother, talked herself into being a woman with an ordinary fate. When she moved on to the next place, she would leave no mystery or damage behind; no one in this world would be disturbed by having known her. ♦</p>	Yiyun Li	March 10, 2014 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/03/10/a-sheltered-woman	Aging	Books	China	Chinese	Elderly	Grandparents	Auntie Mei	Third	Immigrants
An Honest Exit	<p>Thirty-five <span data-page="page_1"></span>years after my father left Ethiopia, he died in a room in a boarding house in Peoria, Illinois, that came with a partial view of the river. We had never spoken much during his lifetime, but, on a warm October morning in New York shortly after he died, I found myself having a conversation with him as I walked north on Amsterdam Avenue, toward the high school where for the past three years I had been teaching a course in Early American literature to privileged freshmen.</p><p>“That’s the Academy right there,” I told him. “You can see the top of the bell tower through the trees. I’m the only one who calls it the Academy. That’s not its real name. I stole it from a short story by Kafka that I read in college—a monkey who’s been trained to talk gives a speech to an academy. I used to wonder if that was how my students and the other teachers, even with all their liberal, cultured learning, saw me—as a monkey trying to teach their language back to them. Do you remember how you spoke? I hated it. You used those short, broken sentences that sounded as if you were spitting out the words, as if you had just learned them but already despised them, even the simplest ones. ‘Take this.’ ‘Don’t touch.’ ‘Leave now.’ ”</p><p>I arrived in my classroom ten minutes before the bell rang, just as the first of my students trickled in. They were the smartest, and took their seats near the center. The rest arrived in no discernible order, but I noticed that all of them, smart and stupid alike, seemed hardly to talk, or, if they talked, it was only in whispers. Most said hello as they entered, but their voices were more hesitant than usual, as if they weren’t sure that it was really me they were addressing.</p><p>“I’m sorry for having missed class the other day,” I began, and because I felt obliged to explain my absence I told them the truth. “My father passed away recently. I had to attend to his affairs.”</p><p>And yet, because I had just finished talking to him, I felt that I hadn’t said enough. So I continued. “He was sixty-seven years old when he died. He was born in a small village in northern Ethiopia. He was thirty-two when he left his home for a port town in Sudan in order to come here.”</p><p>And while I could have ended there I had no desire to. I needed a history more complete than the strangled bits that he had owned and passed on to me—a short, brutal tale of having been trapped as a stowaway on a ship. So I continued with my father’s story, knowing that I could make up the missing details as I went.</p><p>He was an engineer before he left Ethiopia, I told my students, but after spending several months in prison for attending a political rally banned by the government he was reduced to nothing. He knew that if he returned home he would eventually be arrested again, and that this time he wouldn’t survive, so he took what little he had left and followed a group of men who told him that they were heading to Sudan, because it was the only way out.</p><p>For one week he walked west. He had never been in this part of the country before. Everything was flat, from the land to the horizon, one uninterrupted stream that not even a cloud dared to break. The fields were thick with wild green grass and bursts of yellow flowers. Eventually he found a ride on the back of a pickup truck already crowded with refugees heading toward the border. Every few hours, they passed a village, each one a cluster of thatch-roofed huts with a dirt road carved down the middle, where children eagerly waved as the refugees passed, as if the simple fact that they were travelling in a truck meant they were off to someplace better.</p><p>When he finally arrived at the port town in Sudan, he had already lost a dozen pounds. His slightly bulbous nose stood in stark contrast to the sunken cheeks and wide eyes that seemed to have been buried deep above them. His clothes fit him poorly. His hands looked larger; the bones were more visible. He thought his fingers were growing.</p><p>This was the farthest from home he had ever travelled, but he knew that he couldn’t stay there. He wanted to leave the entire continent far behind, for Europe or America, where life was rumored to be better.</p><p>It was the oldest port in Sudan and one of the oldest cities in the country. At its peak, fifty thousand people had lived there, but now only a fraction of the population was left. Several wars had been fought nearby, the last one in 1970, between a small group of rebels and the government. There were burned-out tanks on the edge of town and dozens of half-destroyed, abandoned houses. There was sand and dust everywhere, and on most days the temperature came close to a hundred degrees. The people who lived there were desperately poor. Some worked as fishermen but most spent their days by the dock, looking for work unloading crates from the dozens of small freight ships in the harbor. My father<span data-page="page_2"></span> was told that he could find a job there, and that if he was patient and earned enough money he could even buy his way out of the country on one of the boats.</p><p>The bell for the end of first period rang then. My students waited a moment before gathering their bags and leaving; they were either compelled or baffled by what I had told them. I tried to see them all in one long glance before they were gone. They had always been just bodies to me, a prescribed number that came and went each day of the semester until they were replaced by others, who would do the same. For a few seconds, though, I saw them clearly—the deliberately rumpled hair of the boys and the neat, tidy composure of the girls in opposition. They were still in the making, each and every one of them. Somehow I had missed that. None of them looked away or averted their gaze from mine, which I took as confirmation that I could continue.</p><p>As I walked home that night I was aware of a growing vortex of e-mails and text messages being passed among my students. Millions of invisible bits of data were being transmitted through underground cable wires and satellite networks, and I was their sole subject and object of concern. I don’t know why I found so much comfort in that thought, but it nearly lifted me off the ground, and suddenly, everywhere, I felt embraced. As I walked down Riverside Drive, with the Hudson River and the rush of traffic pouring up and down the West Side Highway to my right, the tightly controlled neighborhood borders and divisions hardly mattered.</p><p>The next day at the Academy I told my students at the start of class that they could put their anthologies and worksheets away. “We won’t be needing them for now,” I said.</p><p>My father’s first job at the port was bringing tea to the dockworkers, a job for which he was paid only in tips—a few cents here and there that gradually added up. On an average day, he would serve anywhere between three and five hundred cups of tea. He could carry as many as ten at a time on a large wooden platter that he learned to balance on his forearm. As a child he had been clumsy; his father would often yell at him for breaking a glass or for being unable to bring him a cup of coffee without spilling it. So as soon as he got the job he began practicing at night with a tray full of stones that were as light as the cups of tea. If the stones moved he knew he had failed and would try again, until eventually he probably could have walked several miles without spilling a drop of tea or shifting a single stone.</p><p>He hid his earnings in a pocket sewn into the inside of his pants. The one friend he had in town, a man by the name of Abrahim, had told him never to let anyone know how much money he had: “If someone sees you have two dollars, he will think you have twenty. It’s always better to make people think you have nothing at all.”</p><p>Abrahim was the one who found him the job carrying tea. He met my father on his third day in town and knew immediately that he was a foreigner. He went up to him and said, in perfect English, “Hello. My name is Abrahim, like the prophet. Let me help you while you’re in this town.”</p><p>He was several inches shorter and better dressed than most of the other men that my father had seen there. His head was bald, with the exception of two graying tufts of hair that arced behind his ears. The last two fingers on his right hand looked as if they had been crushed and then tied together. He bowed slightly when he introduced himself and walked with what might have been a small limp, which in my father’s mind made trusting him easier.</p><p>At first, my father slept outside, near the harbor, where hundreds of other men also camped out, most of them refugees like him. Abrahim had told him that it was dangerous to sleep alone, but he had also said that if he slept in the town he was certain to be beaten and arrested by the police.</p><p>After a week out there, he heard footsteps near his head just as he was falling asleep. When he opened his eyes and looked up he saw three men standing nearby, their backs all slightly turned to him, so that he could see only their long white djellabahs, dirty but not nearly as filthy as some of the others that he had recently seen. As he watched, one of the men lifted his hands into the air slowly, as if he were struggling to pass something over his head. He recited a prayer that my father had heard several times on his way to Sudan and on multiple occasions in Ethiopia at the homes of Muslim friends. The man repeated the prayer a second and then a third time, and when he was finished the two other men bent down and picked up what at first appeared to be a sack of grain but which,<span data-page="page_3"></span> he realized a second later, was clearly a body. The man had been lying there when my father went to sleep. There had been nothing to indicate that he was dead or even injured. When my father told Abrahim the next day, his response was simple: “Don’t think about it too much. It’s easy to die around here and have no one notice.”</p><p>He promised to find my father a better place to sleep, and he did. Later that same day, he found my father preparing his mat near the harbor, and told him to follow him. “I have a surprise for you,” he said.</p><p>The owner of the boarding house where he was going to stay from now on was a business associate of Abrahim’s. “We’ve worked together many times over the years,” Abrahim told my father, although he never explained what they did. When my father asked him how he could repay his kindness, he waved the question away. “Don’t worry,” Abrahim told him. “You can do something for me later. ”</p><p>Unlike most of what I had told my students so far, Abrahim had a real history that I could draw on. My father had mentioned him regularly, not as a part of normal conversation but as a casual aside that could come up at any time without warning. Unbidden, my father had often said that Abrahim was the only real friend he had ever had, and on several occasions he had credited him with saving his life. At other times, my father had claimed that the world was full of crooks, and that after his experiences with a man named Abrahim in Sudan he would never trust a Sudanese, Muslim, or African again.</p><p>The Abrahim who came to life in my classroom was a far nobler man than the one I had previously imagined. This Abrahim had a flair for blunt but poetic statements, like the time he told my father that even the sand in the port town was of an inferior quality to the kind he had known in his home village, hundreds of kilometres west of there. “Everything here is shit,” he said. “Even the sand.”</p><p>Eventually he got my father a better-paying second job, as a porter on the docks. He told him, “You’re going to be my best investment yet. Everything I give to you I will get back tenfold.” Abrahim came by almost every day to share a cup of tea shortly after evening prayers, when hundreds of individual trails of smoke from the campfires wound their way up into the sky. He would pinch and pull at my father’s waist as if he were a goat or a sheep and then say, “What do you expect? I have to check on the health of my investment.” Afterward, as he was leaving, he always offered the same simple piece of advice:</p><p>“Stretch, Yosef!” he would yell out. “Stretch all the time, until your body becomes as loose as a monkey’s.”</p><p>At the docks, my father carried boxes from dawn until midday, when it got too hot too work. Before his shift at the teahouse, he would take a nap under a tree and look at the sea and think about the water in front of him. Like most of the men, he was thirsty all the time and convinced that there was something irreparably cruel about a place that put water that could not be drunk in front of you. He imagined building a boat of his own, something simple but sturdy that could at the very least make its way across the gulf to Saudi Arabia. And, if that were to fail, then he’d stuff himself into a box and drift until he reached a foreign shore or died trying.</p><p>At least once or twice a week, Abrahim would pick my father up from his room in the evening and walk him down to the docks in order to explain to him how the port town really worked. The only lights they saw came from the scattered fires around which groups of men were huddled. Despite the darkness, people moved about freely and in greater numbers than during the day. It was as if a second city were buried underneath the first, and excavated each night. Women without veils could be spotted along some of the narrow back streets, and my father could smell roasting meat and strong liquor.</p><p>“The ships that you see at the far end of the port are all government-controlled,” Abrahim told my father. “They carry one of two things: food or weapons. We don’t make either in Sudan. You may have noticed this. That doesn’t mean we don’t love them equally. Maybe the weapons more. Have you ever seen a hungry man with a gun? Of course not. Always stay away from that part of the dock. It’s run by a couple of generals and a colonel who report straight to the President. They are like gods in this little town, but with better cars. If a soldier sees you there’s nothing I can do to help. Not even God will save a fool.</p><p>“The food is supposed to go to the south. It comes from all over the world in great big sacks that say ‘U.S.A.’ Instead, it goes straight to Khartoum with the weapons. And do you know why? Because it’s<span data-page="page_4"></span> easier and cheaper to starve people to death than to shoot them. Bullets cost money. Soldiers cost money. Keeping all the food in a warehouse costs nothing.”</p><p>In the course of several evenings, Abrahim worked his way down the line of boats docked in the harbor. His favorite ones, he said, were those near the end.</p><p>“Those ships over there—all the way at the other end. Those are the ones you need to think about. Those are the ones that go to Europe. You know how you can tell? Look at the flags. You see that one there—with the black and gold? It goes all the way to Italy or Spain. Maybe even France. Some of the men who work on it are friends of mine. Business associates. You can trust them. They’re not like the rest of the people here, who will disappear with your money.”</p><p>After that night, my father began to take seriously Abrahim’s advice about stretching. He worked his body into various positions that he would hold for ten or fifteen minutes, and then for as long as an hour. At night before he went to bed he practiced sitting with his legs crossed, and then he stretched his back by curling himself into a ball. After four months he could hold that position for hours, which was precisely what Abrahim told him he would need to do.</p><p>“The first few hours will be the hardest,” he said. “You’ll have to be on the ship before it’s fully loaded, and then you will have to stay completely hidden. Only once it’s far out to sea will you be able to move.”</p><p>My father thought about writing a letter to his family, but he didn’t know what to say. No one knew for certain if he was alive, and, until he was confident that he would remain so, he preferred to keep it that way. It was better than writing home and saying, “Hello. I miss you. I’m alive and well,” when only the first half of that statement was certain still to be true by the time the letter arrived.</p><p>Four months and three weeks after my father arrived in the port town, war broke out in the east. A garrison of soldiers stationed in a village five hundred miles away revolted, and with the help of the villagers began to take over vast swaths of territory in the name of forming an independent state for all the black tribes of the country. There were rumors of massacres on both sides. Who was responsible for the killing always depended on who was talking. It was said that in one village all the young boys had been forced to dig graves for their parents and siblings before watching their executions. Afterward they were forced to join the rebellion that still didn’t have a name.</p><p>Factions began to erupt all over the town. Older men who remembered the last war tended to favor the government, since they had once been soldiers as well. Anyone who was born in the south of the country was ardently in favor of the rebels, and many vowed to join them if they ever came close.</p><p>Abrahim and my father stopped going to the port at night. “When the fighting breaks out here,” Abrahim told him, “they’ll attack the port first. They’ll burn the local ships and try to take control of the government ones.”</p><p>Every day more soldiers arrived. There had always been soldiers in town, but these new ones were different. They came from the opposite corner of the country and spoke none of the local languages; what Arabic they spoke was often almost impossible to understand. The senior commanders, who rode standing up in their jeeps, all wore bright-gold sunglasses that covered half their face, but it was clear regardless that they were foreigners, and had been brought here because they had no attachment to the town or to its people.</p><p>At night my father often heard gunfire mixed in with the sound of dogs howling. Every day he pleaded with Abrahim to help him find a way out.</p><p>“I have plenty of money saved now,” he said, even though it was a lie. If there was an honest exit, he would find a way to pay for it. Abrahim’s response was always the same: “A man who has no patience here is better off in Hell.”</p><p>Two weeks after the first stories of the rebellion appeared, there was talk in the market of a mile-long convoy of jeeps heading toward the town. The foreign ships had begun to leave the port that morning. The rebels were advancing, and would be there by the end of the afternoon. Within hours the rumors had circled the town. They would spare no one. They would attack only the soldiers. They would be greeted as liberators. They were like animals and should be treated as such. My father watched as the women who lived nearby folded their belongings into bags and made for the road with their children at their side or strapped to their backs. Where are they going? he wondered. They have the sea on one side and a desert on the other.</p><p>Abrahim found him after lunch. There was no one to serve tea to that day.</p><p>“I see you’re very busy,” he said. “You want me to come<span data-page="page_5"></span> back when it’s less crowded?”</p><p>“Are you leaving?” my father asked him.</p><p>“I already have,” Abrahim said. “A long time ago. My entire family is already in Khartoum. I’m just waiting for my body to join them.”</p><p>By late in the afternoon they could hear distant mortar shells slamming into the desert. “They’re like children with toys,” Abrahim said, pointing out to the desert from the roof of the boarding house, where they were standing. “They don’t even know yet how far they can shoot with their big guns. There’s nothing out there—or maybe they’ll get lucky and kill a camel. They’ll keep doing that until eventually they run out of shells, or camels.</p><p>“It’s going to be terrible what happens to them,” Abrahim continued. “They think they can scare away the soldiers because they have a couple of big guns. They think it’s 1898 and the Battle of Omdurman again, except now they’re the British.”</p><p>My father never thought that war could look simple or pathetic, but from that rooftop it did. The rebels were loudly announcing their approach, and, from what my father could see, the soldiers in the town had disappeared. He began to think that Abrahim was wrong, and that the rebels, despite their foolishness, would sweep into town with barely a struggle. He was thinking whether or not to say this to Abrahim when he heard the first distant rumbling over his head. Abrahim and my father turned and looked out toward the sea, where a plane was approaching, flying far too low. Within a minute, it was above them.</p><p>“This will be over soon,” Abrahim said. They both waited to hear the sound of a bomb dropping, but nothing happened. The plane had pulled up at the last minute. Shots were harmlessly fired in its direction and the convoy kept approaching—a long, jagged line of old pickup trucks trying to escape the horizon.</p><p>When the same plane returned twenty minutes later, three slimmer and clearly foreign-made jets were flying close to it.</p><p>“The first was just a warning,” Abrahim said. “To give them a chance to at least try to run away. They were too stupid to understand that. They thought they had won.”</p><p>The planes passed. My father and Abrahim counted the seconds. Even from a distance they made a spectacular roar—at least seven bombs were dropped directly onto the rebels, whose convoy disappeared into a cloud of smoke and sand. From some of the neighboring rooftops there were shouts of joy. Soldiers were soon spilling back out into the street singing their victory.</p><p>“They should never have tried to take the port,” Abrahim said. “They could have spent years fighting in the desert for their little villages and no one would have really bothered them. But do you think any of those big countries were going to risk losing this beautiful port? By the end of tonight all the foreign ships will be back. Their governments will tell them that it’s safe. They’ve taken care of the problem, and soon, maybe in a day or two, you’ll be able to leave.”</p><p>A week later, during my father’s mid-afternoon break, Abrahim found him resting in his usual spot in the shade, staring out at the water. The two of them walked to a nearby café, and for the first time since my father had come to Sudan someone brought him a cup of tea and lunch.</p><p>‘This is your going-away meal. Enjoy it,” Abrahim said. “You’re leaving tonight.”</p><p>Abrahim ordered a large plate of grilled meats—sheep intestines and what looked to be the neck of a goat—cooked in a brown stew, a feast unlike anything my father had eaten in months. When the food came, he wanted to cry and was briefly afraid to eat it. Abrahim had always told him never to trust anyone, and of course my father had extended that advice to Abrahim himself. Perhaps this was Abrahim’s final trick on him: perhaps the food would disappear just as he leaned over to touch it, or perhaps it was poisoned with something that would send him off into a deep sleep from which he would awake in shackles. My father reached into his pants and untied the pouch in which he carried all his money. He placed it on the table.</p><p>“That’s everything I have,” he said. “I don’t know if it’s enough.”</p><p>Abrahim ignored the money and dipped into the food with a piece of bread.</p><p>“After where your hand has just been I suggest you wash it before eating,” he said. “And take your purse with you.”</p><p>When they were finished, Abrahim walked my father to a part of the town he had never seen before—a wide dusty street that grew increasingly narrow, until the tin-roofed shacks that lined it were almost touching one another. Abrahim and my father stopped in front of one of the houses, and Abrahim pulled back the curtain that served as the door. Inside, a heavyset older woman, head partly veiled, sat behind a wooden counter on top of which rested a row of variously sized glass bottles. Abrahim grabbed one and told my father to take a seat in the corner of the room where a group of pillows had been laid. He negotiated and argued with the woman for several minutes until, finally, he pulled a<span data-page="page_6"></span> bundle of Sudanese notes from his breast pocket. He sat down next to my father and handed the bottle to him.</p><p>“A drink for the road,” he said. “Take it slow.”</p><p>If Abrahim’s intention was to harm him, then so be it, my father thought. A decent meal and a drink afterward were not the worst way to go. If such things had been offered to every dying man in this town, then the line of men waiting to die would have stretched for miles.</p><p>“Give me your little purse now,” Abrahim said. My father handed him the pouch and Abrahim flipped through the bills. He took a few notes from his own pile and added it to the collection.</p><p>“This will buy you water, maybe a little food, and the silence of a few people on board. Don’t expect anything else from them. Don’t ask for food or for anything that they don’t give you. Don’t look them in the eyes, and don’t try to talk to them. They will act as if you don’t exist, which is the best thing. If you do exist then they will throw you overboard at night. Men get on board and they begin to complain. They say their backs hurt or their legs hurt. They say they’re thirsty or hungry. When that happens they’re gagged and thrown into the sea, where they can have all the space and water they want.”</p><p>My father took a sip of the liquor, whose harsh, acrid smell had filled the air the moment Abrahim popped the lid.</p><p>“When you get to Europe, this is what you are going to do. You are going to be arrested. You will tell them that you want political asylum and they will take you to a jail that looks like Heaven. They will give you food and clothes and even a bed to sleep in. You may never want to leave—that’s how good it will feel. Tell them you were fighting against the Communists and they will love you. They will give you your pick of countries, and you will tell them that you want to go to England. You will tell them that you have left behind your wife in Sudan, and that her life is now in danger and you want her to come as well. You will show them this picture.”</p><p>Abrahim pulled from his wallet a photograph of a young girl, no older than fifteen or sixteen, dressed in a bizarre array of Western clothes—a pleated black-and-white polka-dot dress that was several sizes too large, a pair of high-top sneakers, and makeup that had been painted on to make her look older.</p><p>“This is my daughter. She lives in Khartoum right now with her mother and aunts. She’s very bright. The best student in her class. When you get to England you’re going to say that she’s your wife. This is how you’re going to repay me. Do you understand?”</p><p>My father nodded.</p><p>“This is proof of your marriage,” Abrahim said. “I had to spend a lot of money to get that made.”</p><p>Abrahim handed him a slip of paper that had been folded only twice in its life, since such paper didn’t last long in environments like this. The words spelled it out clearly. My father had been married for almost two years to a person he had never met.</p><p>“You will give this to someone at the British Embassy,” Abrahim said, laying his hands on top of my father’s, as if the two were entering into a secret pact simply by touching the same piece of paper. “It may take some weeks, but eventually they will give her the visa. You will then call me from London, and I will take care of the rest. We have the money for the ticket, and some more for both of you when she arrives. Maybe after one or two years her mother and I will join you in London. We will buy a home. Start a business together. My daughter will continue her studies.”</p><p>Even for a skeptical man like my father, who had little faith in governments, the story was seductive: a tale that began with heavenly prisons and ended with a pre-made family living in a home in London. He didn’t want to see how much Abrahim believed in it himself, and so he kept his head slightly turned away. When it came to Europe or America, even people supposedly hardened by time and experience were susceptible to almost childish fantasies.</p><p>My father took the photograph from Abrahim and placed it in his pocket. He didn’t say, “Of course I will do this,” or even a simple “Yes,” because such confirmation would have meant that there was an option to refuse, and no such thing existed between them. Abrahim told him to finish his drink. “Your ship is waiting,” he said.</p><p>Soon, stories about my father were circulating freely around the Academy. I heard snippets of my own narrative played back to me in a slightly distorted form—in these versions, the story might take place in the Congo, amid famine. One version I heard said that my father had been in multiple wars across Africa. Another claimed that he had lived through a forgotten genocide, one in which tens of thousands were killed in a single day. Some wondered whether he had also<span data-page="page_7"></span> been in Rwanda—or in Darfur, where such things were commonly known to occur.</p><p>Huge tides of sympathy were mounting for my dead father and me. Students I had never spoken to now said hello to me when they saw me in the hallway. There were smiles for me everywhere I went, all because I had brought directly to their door a tragedy that outstripped anything they could personally have hoped to experience.</p><p>I knew that it was only a matter of time before I was called to account for what I had been teaching my students. On a Friday, the dean caught me in the hall just as I was preparing to enter my classroom. There was nothing threatening or angry in his voice. He simply said, “Come and see me in my office when your class is over.”</p><p>That day I decided to skip the story and return to my usual syllabus. I said to my students, “We have some work to catch up on today. Here are the assignments from last week. I want you to work on them quietly.” If they groaned or mumbled something, I didn’t hear it, and hardly cared. When class was over, I walked slowly up the three flights of stairs that led to the dean’s office. He was waiting for me with the door open. His wide and slightly awkward body was pitched over the large wooden desk far enough so that it might have made it difficult for him to breathe. As soon as I sat down, he leaned back and exhaled.</p><p>“How was class today?” he asked me.</p><p>“Fine,” I told him. “Nothing exceptional.”</p><p>“I’ve heard some of the stories about your father that you’ve been telling your students,” he said. At that point I expected him to reveal at least a hint of anger at what I had done, but there wasn’t even a dramatic folding of the arms.</p><p>“It’s very interesting what they’re saying,” he said. “Awful, of course, as well. No one should have to live through anything even remotely like that, which leads me to ask: How much of what they’re saying is true?”</p><p>“Almost none of it,” I told him. I was ready to admit that I had made up most of what I had told my students—the late nights at the port, the story of an invading rebel army storming across the desert. But before I could say anything further he gave me a sly, almost sarcastic smile.</p><p>“Well, regardless of that,” he said, “it’s good to hear them talking about important things. So much of what I hear from them is shallow, silly rumors. They can sort out what’s true for themselves later.”</p><p>And that was all it came down to: I had given my students something to think about, and whether what they heard from me had any relationship to reality hardly mattered; real or not, it was all imaginary for them. That death was involved only made the story more compelling.</p><p>I began my final lesson with my father and Abrahim walking down to the pier on their last morning together. They didn’t say much along the way, but on occasion a few words slipped out. Abrahim had important ideas that he wanted to express, but he had never known the exact words for them in any language. If he could have, he would have grabbed my father firmly by the wrist and held him until he was certain that he understood just how much he depended on him and how much he had begun almost to hate him for that. My father, meanwhile, was desperate to get away. He was terrified of boarding the ship, but he was more frightened of Abrahim’s desire.</p><p>When they reached the pier, Abrahim pointed to the last of three boats docked in the harbor. “It’s that one,” he said. “The one with the blue hull.”</p><p>My father stared at the boat for a long time and tried to imagine what it would be like to be buried inside it, first for an hour and then for a day. He didn’t have the courage to imagine anything longer. The boat was old, but almost everything in the town was old.</p><p>There was a tall, light-skinned man waiting at the end of the docks. He was from one of the Arab tribes in the north. Such men were common in town. They controlled most of its business and politics and had done so for centuries. They were traders, merchants, and sold anything or anyone. They held themselves at a slight remove from other men, gowned in spotless white or, on occasion, pastel-colored robes that somehow proved immune to the dust that covered every inch of the town.</p><p>“He’s arranged everything,” Abrahim said. “That man over there.”</p><p>My father tried to make out his face from where they were standing, but the man seemed to understand that they were talking about him and kept his head turned slightly away. The only feature that my father could make out was an abnormally long and narrow nose, a feature that seemed almost predatory.</p><p>Abrahim handed my father a slip of yellow legal paper on which he had written something in Arabic. He would have liked Abrahim to say something kind and reassuring to him. He wanted him to say, “Have a safe journey” or “Don’t worry. You’re going<span data-page="page_8"></span> to be fine,” but he knew that he could stand there for years and no such reassurances would come.</p><p>“Don’t keep him waiting,” Abrahim said. “Give him the note and your money. And do whatever he tells you.”</p><p>When my father was halfway between Abrahim and the man, Abrahim called out to him, “I’ll be waiting to hear from you soon,” and my father knew that was the last time he would ever hear Abrahim’s voice.</p><p>My father handed over the slip of paper Abrahim had given him. He couldn’t read what was written on it and was worried that it might say any of a thousand different things, from “Treat this man well” to “Take his money and do whatever you want with him.”</p><p>The man pointed to a group of small storage slots at the stern of the boat that were used for holding the more delicate cargo. These crates were usually unloaded last, and he had often seen people waiting at the docks for hours to receive them. They always bore the stamp of a Western country and carried their instructions in a foreign language—“<em>Cuidado</em>,” “Fragile.” He had unloaded several such crates himself recently, and while he had never known their actual contents he had tried to guess what was inside: cartons of powdered milk, a television or stereo, vodka, Scotch, Ethiopian coffee, soft blankets, clean water, hundreds of new shoes and shirts and underwear. Anything that he was missing or knew he would never have he imagined arriving in those boxes.</p><p>There was a square hole just large enough for my father to fit into if he pulled his knees up to his chest. He understood that this was where he was supposed to go and yet naturally he hesitated, sizing up the dimensions just as he had once sized up the crates he had helped unload.</p><p>My father felt the man’s hand around the back of his neck, pushing him toward the ground. He wanted to tell the man that he was prepared to enter on his own, and had in fact been preparing to do so for months now, but he wouldn’t have been understood, so my father let himself be led. He crawled into the space on his knees, which was not how he would have liked to enter. Head first was the way to go, but it was too late now. In a final humiliating gesture, the man shoved him with his foot, stuffing him inside so quickly that his legs and arms collapsed around him. He had just enough time to arrange himself before the man sealed the entrance with a wooden door that was resting nearby.</p><p>Before getting on the boat, my father had made a list of things to think about in order to get through the journey. They were filed away under topic headings such as The Place Where I Was Born, Plans for the Future, and Important Words in English. He wasn’t sure if he should turn to them now or wait until the boat was out of the harbor. The darkness inside the box was alarming, but it wasn’t yet complete. Light still filtered in through the entrance, and continued to do so until the hull was closed and the boat began to pull away from the shore. He remembered that as a child he had often been afraid of the dark, a foolish, almost impossible thing for a country boy, but there it was. Of the vast extended family that lived around him, his mother was the only one who never mocked him for this, and even though he would have liked to save her image for later in the journey, at a point when he was far off at sea, he let himself think about her now. He saw her as she looked shortly before she died. She had been a large woman, but at that point there wasn’t much left of her. Her hair hadn’t gone gray yet, but it had been cut short on the advice of a cousin who had dreamed that the illness attacking her body was buried somewhere in her head and needed a way out. Desperate, she had had almost all her hair cut off, which had made her look even younger than her thirty-something years. This was the image he had, of his mother in an almost doll-like state, just two months before she died, and while he would have liked to have a better memory of her, he settled for the one he’d been given and closed his eyes to concentrate on it. It would be some minutes before he noticed the engine churning as the ship pulled up its anchors and slowly headed out to sea.</p><p>When I reached this point, I knew that it was the last thing I was going to say to my class. Soon, the dean would call me back to his office to tell me that, as interesting as my father’s story was, it had gone on long enough, and it was time to return my class to normal, or risk my place at the Academy. The bell rang, and, as when I had begun this story, there were a good ten to fifteen seconds when no one in the classroom moved. My students, for all their considerable wealth and privilege, were still at an age where they believed<span data-page="page_final"></span> that the world was a fascinating, remarkable place, worthy of curious inquiry and close scrutiny, and I’d like to think that I had reminded them of that. Soon enough they would grow out of that and concern themselves with the things that were most immediately relevant to their own lives. Eventually one bag was picked up off the floor, and then twenty-eight others joined it. Most of my students waved or nodded their heads as they left the room, and there was a part of me that wanted to call them back to their seats and tell them that the story wasn’t quite finished yet. Getting out of Sudan was only the beginning; there was still much more ahead. Sometimes, in my imagination, that is exactly what I tell them. I pick up where I left off, and go on to describe to them how, despite all appearances, my father did not actually make it off that boat alive. He arrived in Europe just as Abrahim had promised he would, but an important part of him had died during the journey, somewhere in the final three days, when he was reduced to drinking his urine for water and could no longer feel his hands or feet.</p><p>He spent six months in a detention camp on an island off the coast of Italy. He was surprised to find that there were plenty of other men like him there, from every possible corner of Africa, and that many had fared worse than he had. He heard stories of men who had died trying to make a similar voyage, who had suffocated or been thrown overboard alive. My father couldn’t even bring himself to pity them. Contrary to what Abrahim had told him, there was nothing even remotely heavenly about where he was held: one large whitewashed room with cots every ten inches and bars over the windows. The guards often yelled at him and the other prisoners. He learned a few words in Italian and was mocked viciously the first time he used them. He was once forced to repeat a single phrase over and over to each new guard who arrived. When he tried to refuse, his first meal of the day, a plate of cold, dry meat and stale bread, was taken away from him. “Speak,” the guards commanded, and he did so dozens of times in the course of several days, even though there was no humor left in it for anyone.</p><p>“You speak Italian?” the guards asked.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Speak. Talk. Or, more rarely, Say something.</p><p>In Italy he was given asylum and set free. From there he worked his way north and then west across Europe. He met dozens of other Abrahims, men who promised him that when they made it to London the rest of their lives would finally resolve into the picture they had imagined. “It’s different there,” they always said. There had to be at least one place in this world where life could be lived in accordance with the plans and dreams they had concocted for themselves. For most, that place was London; for some it was Paris, and for a smaller but bolder few it was America. That faith had carried them this far, and even though it was weakening, and needed constant readjustment (“Rome is not what I thought it would be. France will surely be better”), it persisted out of sheer necessity. By the time my father finally made it to London, eighteen months later, he had begun to think of all the men he met as variations of Abrahim, all of them crippled and deformed by their dreams.</p><p>Abrahim had followed him all the way to London to test him, and my father was determined to settle that debt now that he was there. On his first day in the city he found a quiet corner of Hampstead Heath. An American guidebook that he had picked up in France had said that he would be afforded a wide, sweeping view of the city from there. At the edge of the park, with London at his feet, he set fire to all the documents that he had brought with him from Sudan. The fake marriage license turned to ashes in seconds. The picture of Abrahim’s daughter melted away near a large green hedge with ripe, inedible red berries hanging from it. For many nights afterward, he refused to think about her or her father. There were no rewards in life for such stupidity, and he promised himself never to fall victim to that kind of blind, wishful thinking. Anyone who did deserved whatever suffering he was bound to meet. ♦</p>	Dinaw Mengestu	July 12, 2010 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/07/12/an-honest-exit	Africa	Asylum	Battles	Docks	England	Ethiopia	Unnamed	First	Immigrants
Assimilation	<p>Where <span data-page="page_1"></span>Ramon worked washing dishes, the owner called him in one day and said that he was raising him to busboy. Ramon would wear the short red jacket and black trousers. Ramon’s hands were cracked and peeling from the hot water, but he was wary of the promotion because the owner was selling it to him like there was a catch. They were all foreigners—the owner, the owner’s wife, and the people who came there to eat. Big people with loud voices and bad manners. You are in the waiting pool now, my friend, and on a good night your share could be thirty, forty dollars, under the table. On Sunday morning, Ramon took the bus upstate to see Leon. They talked through the phones. I don’t know why he wants to see my certificate, Ramon said.</p><p>What certificate?</p><p>Of my birth.</p><p>He wants to make sure you’re an American, Leon said.</p><p>So I can?</p><p>Why not? Figure they’re illegals—maybe not the owner, because he has a business that requires a license, but a lot of them. Born here is a commodity, it has a value, so see what the deal is.</p><p>When Ramon presented his birth certificate, they sat down with him in the back after the restaurant was closed for the night—Borislav, the owner, his wife, she of the squinting eyes, and another man, who was fat, like Borislav, but older and with a briefcase in his lap. He was the one who asked the questions. After Ramon gave his answers, they talked among themselves. He heard harsh mouthfuls of words with deep notes—it was not a mellifluous language like the bright bubbling of water over rocks of his language.</p><p>And then, with a flourish, the owner placed on the table a photograph. Look, my friend, he said. The photograph was of a girl, a blonde with sunglasses propped in her hair. Her hand gripping the strap of her shoulder bag was closed like a fist. She wore jeans. She wore a blouse revealing the shoulders. Behind her was a narrow street with an array of motorcycles and mopeds parked front wheels to the curb. She was half sitting sideways on a motorcycle seat, her legs straight out and her feet in their sandals planted on the paving stones. She was smiling.</p><p>How much? Leon said.</p><p>A thousand. Plus air and hotel expenses.</p><p>They are messing with you. This is good for three thousand, minimum.</p><p>And then?</p><p>Why not? It will pay for filmmaker’s school. Isn’t that what you want?</p><p>I don’t know. It’s selling yourself. And it’s a defilement of sacred matters.</p><p>You still have it for Edita?</p><p>No, <em>eso es cuento viejo</em>.</p><p>Then what’s the problem? You sell yourself washing dishes, little bro. This is the country of selling yourself. And what sacred matter do you mean, which this scam bears no resemblance to, if you think about it?</p><p>When the plane landed, Ramon crossed himself. He took the bus to the city. It was already late afternoon and the city was under the heavy dark clouds he had flown through. Packs of motorcycles and mopeds kept pace with the bus and then shot past. Linked streetcars ground around corners and disappeared as if swallowed. It was an old European city of unlighted streets and stone buildings with shuttered windows.</p><p>He had the address of the tourist hotel on a piece of paper. There was just time to change into the suit and they were calling from downstairs.</p><p>The girl from the picture gave him a quick glance of appraisal and nodded. No smile this time. And her hair was different—pulled tight and bound at the neck. She was dressed for the occasion in a white suit jacket with a matching short skirt and white shoes with heels that made her taller than Ramon. She seemed fearful. A bearded heavyset fellow held her elbow.</p><p>They all rode in a taxi to a photographer’s studio. The photographer stood Ramon and the girl in an alcove with potted palms on either side of them and a plastic stained-glass window lit from behind by a floodlamp. They faced a lectern. When Ramon’s shoulder accidentally brushed hers, the girl jumped as if from an electric shock.</p><p>Some sort of city functionary married them. He mumbled and his eyes widened as if he were having trouble focussing. He was drunk. When the photographer’s flash went off behind him he lost his place in his book and had to start again. He swayed, and nearly knocked over the lectern. He clearly didn’t understand the situation because when he pronounced them man and wife he urged them to kiss. The girl laughed as she turned away and ran to the heavyset fellow and kissed him.</p><p>The photographer placed a bouquet of flowers in the girl’s arms and posed her with Ramon for the formal wedding picture. And that was that. Ramon was dropped off at the hotel and the next day he flew home.</p><p>He learned the girl’s name when the lawyer with the briefcase put in front of him the petition to bring her to the States: Jelena. It attests that she is your lawful spouse and you are in hardship without her presence beside you, the lawyer said.</p><p>Jelena, Ramon said, to hear the sound of it. He had not heard it properly, as uttered by<span data-page="page_2"></span> the drunken fool who married them. Jelena.</p><p>Yes. This is all here, everything, marriage certificate, copy of birth certificate, passport, and here is the wedding picture. It couldn’t hurt for you and bride to smile, but O.K.</p><p>The lawyer slapped a pen down on the table. The John Hancock, he said.</p><p>Ramon folded his arms across his chest. The figure was three thousand, he said. I have seen only one thousand.</p><p>Don’t worry, that is to come.</p><p>Ramon nodded. O.K., when it comes, then I will sign.</p><p>The lawyer pressed his hand to his forehead. Borislav, he called to the owner. Borislav!</p><p>And then for an hour the owner and the lawyer threatened and appealed and threatened again. The owner’s wife came over. She said to Ramon, Who are you to have three thousands of dollars! She turned to her husband. I told you he was no good, the mestizo, I warned you.</p><p>Borislav raised his hand. Please, Anya, he said, you are not helping.</p><p>Ramon, he said. This is family, the daughter of my late uncle. I have entrusted you. We are trying to give her a life here where there is hope. Jelena is to pay you the remainder from her wages.</p><p>You did not tell me that when I agreed, Ramon said.</p><p>I promise you. She will work beside you as a waitress. And I am raising you to full-time waiter. You hear me? Wages and tips, wages and tips equal to all the staff. You will see, so do this.</p><p>And while Ramon sat thinking the lawyer said to him, This is a fraud that you have committed, you know that? There is a law—to marry only so that the girl can have a legal residency is to break that law. She is over there, so they cannot touch her. But you! I have just to call them. You know what you get for bringing someone here by pretending love? Five years, my friend. Five years and monetary penalties of an amount you cannot dream. And all I have to do is tell them.</p><p>So tell them, Ramon said. And I will tell them that you wrote the letter for me to sign. And I will tell them that Jelena is of the family of Borislav, the man who employs me. So let’s all tell them.</p><p>You are not to call me Borislav, the owner muttered. That is for friends and family, not for one who works for my wages.</p><p>I checked it out, Leon said through the glass. It’s bullshit. The C.I.S. can’t keep up with the traffic. The risk is small, Ramon. If they do call you in, you say you love the girl. They know you’re lying—but she will back you up, naturally, since it is in her interest. But just to have some insurance you should learn a few things about her.</p><p>What things?</p><p>You know, she watches what TV shows, if she has a birthmark, where it is located. Things.</p><p>She brought her boyfriend to the wedding, Ramon said.</p><p>Of course.</p><p>I didn’t like that. It was unnecessary.</p><p>In two years, once she has her green card without conditions, she will divorce you and bring him here in turn. And they will marry and be Americans.</p><p>Maybe. Maybe the lovers will not be able to wait that long. He will come for a visit and I will kill him.</p><p>Yes, of course, Leon said, smiling. Listen, Ramon, she is just a dumb Hunky. No class, from the sound of it.</p><p>She is still my wife, Ramon said.</p><p>I say split the difference with them. Sign the paper and you’re good for two years. You wait tables and make some decent money. She gets the card with no strings, and you go on to be a famous movie director.</p><p>He did know a thing about her, that she had English as a schoolgirl because she spoke it well enough. And that she wore a navel ring, a silver bar with three teardrop crystals hanging from it. But, of course, everyone knew about her navel because Jelena made sure that they did. She was the one waitress at Borislav’s and so her red jacket was cut for the female figure and between it and the short black skirt a flat band of flesh was visible, the teardrops dangling from her navel and sometimes catching the light as she walked with the tray held high and balanced on her palm.</p><p>Of course the patrons ogled her and the regulars asked for her tables, but that was all right—her tips went into the pool.</p><p>Ramon himself had picked up the waiter’s craft quite easily, after all his time busing, and he discovered that his formality and careful, quiet demeanor and efficient service had the effect sometimes of raising the manners and lowering the voices of the boors he served.</p><p>Jelena smoked. She would take a drag in the kitchen and leave the cigarette burning in a dish as she went out through the doors, and it would be there smoldering until she came back in for another order and another hit.</p><p>She did not match the photograph of the smiling blonde with the sunglasses in her hair. She was, instead, an ordinary working girl with a life of serious plans and no time to pose for a picture, with<span data-page="page_3"></span> her long legs in the sun and a European city behind her.</p><p>He wanted to learn everything about her, maybe for insurance, as Leon advised, but more because he felt he had rights as her legal husband. It was Jelena’s habit, when she had a moment, to step into the alley to use her cell phone. He saw her cast in a red glow from Borislav’s electric sign. He listened at the slightly opened door, hearing her voice despite the kitchen shouts and the clatter rushing past his ears. She spoke loudly as if to cover the great distance to her boyfriend in Europe. Of course it was her boyfriend, that heavy fellow with the sloping shoulders who had been at the wedding. Who else in Europe would she be calling at night? With the time difference, she had to have awakened him, or maybe he had not yet been to sleep. Perhaps she was making sure that he was not with someone else, because sometimes she seemed about to cry—this could be inferred from the tone of voice, never mind the language.</p><p>Jelena lived in Borislav’s house, a few blocks from the restaurant. I’ll walk you home, Ramon would say at the end of a night’s work. Good night, Ramon, Jelena would say, but made no further effort to stop him as he walked beside her. On these occasions, he would ask her about her family, if her parents were alive, what her father did, did she have brothers and sisters, where she went to school. She would not answer.</p><p>It is not wise for you to keep things from your husband, Jelena.</p><p>Ramon, you are a pestilence, you know that?</p><p>Not a pestilence, Jelena, you mean a pest. Nevertheless, the time may come in front of the authorities when I need to know these things, for your sake, not for mine.</p><p>And when that time is here I will tell you.</p><p>He would wait in the street while she climbed the steps and entered the house and wait some more until the light went on in her room on the top floor. Then he would continue on to his own room, several blocks away. He thought in the moonlight of the things he knew about her: the jewelled navel, the thin face and high cheekbones, the gray eyes that slanted upward at the corners, and her long stride for a girl.</p><p>In the fall, Leon was sprung and called Ramon to invite him to a party. It was to be on a Monday night. Borislav’s was closed on Mondays, so Ramon could go. He insisted that Jelena go with him. She needs to know about me, he said to Borislav, just as I need to know about her. She will meet my family and have some idea in the event that we are ever questioned by the authorities. Borislav nodded and informed Jelena. She was furious. Don’t talk to me of government, Uncle! Why did I come here and risk losing everything, if not to have an end to government in my life?</p><p>What is the everything you risk losing? Ramon said.</p><p>Oh, shut up, you—going to Borislav like a child.</p><p>When Monday came, Ramon picked her up in a car supplied by Leon. She was clearly taken aback by this luxury—a town car with a driver in a black suit—but she pretended to be unimpressed, just as he’d expected she would. It was a warm night and she wore her white jacket from the wedding, but with pale-olive slacks and a flower-patterned blouse, with an Orthodox cross hanging in her cleavage. Ramon supposed that the cross and the pendant on her navel were in a direct line. She saw him looking and grabbed his tie and pulled him toward her. Listen, Mr. Ramon pest, you can wrap Borislav around your finger, but I know what is in that mind of yours and I’m telling you it will never happen, you understand? Never! Is that clear to you, my husband? Never! And she let go and sat back in the car.</p><p>Ramon adjusted his tie. He said, I don’t like you, either, Jelena, but if you required me to perform the conjugal duties of a husband I would comply, if only to honor our sacred bond.</p><p>The party was in Leon’s loft and it was filled with glamorous people, sinuous and of high fashion, all of them dancing intensely. A d.j. was running the show. Music throbbed up from the floor and colored lights rotated slowly over the dancers, as if examining them. Jelena shook her head and he got her to say something. She said that the lights reminded her of her childhood, when searchlights had moved over the rooftops at night.</p><p>Ramon found a place for them among glass tables for two in a far corner of the loft, where on wheeled carts food was set out for the taking: platters of shrimp, sushi, slices of roast beef, a sculpted pyramid of caviar on a salver with points of toast, diced onion, sour cream, capers, and lemon in attendance.</p><p>Jelena’s eyes widened. She sipped her Coca-Cola. She moved her chair closer to Ramon’s. Let me ask you something that I don’t understand, she said. This is your brother, a very rich man, I guess, to have all this. I see his place with its<span data-page="page_4"></span> paintings and big windows overlooking the river and all his friends of every color, who are what is called beautiful people, yes? But Ramon the brother waits tables in Brooklyn. How is this explained?</p><p>Ramon said, I love my brother, but I do not share his life’s values.</p><p>Saying this, he looked over the crowd and recognized several of Leon’s men.</p><p>Two had been at the door as he came in. For a moment, he’d seen a question in their eyes, perhaps because of Jelena, but a moment later Leon was there and the brothers hugged and Ramon said, Leon, this is my wife, Jelena.</p><p>Leon saw them now and came over. Why aren’t you dancing? he said to Ramon.</p><p>She chooses not to.</p><p>Come, Leon said, and without giving Jelena a choice in the matter he took her by the hand and led her to the dance floor.</p><p>Ramon watched them, Leon flushed with exuberance, with freedom, a graceful dancer with creative moves, and Jelena clearly feeling out of her element, seeing around her the young women in all the fashions of planned carelessness and comparing herself badly, a provincial, maybe smart enough in the cafés of Eastern Europe, and a star at Borislav’s, but here a poor relative. Ramon felt sorry for her.</p><p>Leon had kept himself fit in prison. His short-sleeved jersey showed his biceps. His head was shaved and he wore stylish black-rimmed glasses. He was elegant and had a self-assurance that Ramon could imitate only in moments of conscious effort.</p><p>When the party went into its loose-limbed, heedless phase, loud with stoned laughter and drunken appreciations, the music pulsing through the acrid atmosphere, Ramon decided that it was time to leave</p><p>Jelena was already out the door when Leon said, Ramon, if you want to, my sense is that it is possible.</p><p>Why?</p><p>She told me that you never smile.</p><p>So how does that mean anything?</p><p>It means that she observes you. I told her that she should give you something to smile about.</p><p>That is very unlikely.</p><p>I told her how smart you are, how you could read at the age of four.</p><p>Oh, sure, that will certainly help. She is indebted to me for a thousand dollars. I haven’t seen any of it.</p><p>Leon laughed and gave Ramon a big hug. Ah, my brother, maybe you are not so smart after all.</p><p>After the night at Leon’s, Borislav’s restaurant with its dark furniture and thick carpets and red velvet drapes and amateur paintings seemed to Ramon unforgivably tacky. Yet working the same room with Jelena, doing the same thing at the same time, gave him a feeling of being home. And now he regretted bragging to her about what an independent person he was, with his uncompromising values. The truth was that Leon had seen him through four years at City College. And neither did this life he had drifted into have anything to do with values. He had felt restless, with only a vague ambition to make films, and gripped with a kind of wanderlust, though he had not wandered farther than Brooklyn. He’d got off the El one day when the sun shone in the window. It seemed to him a different light here than you had in Manhattan. He walked around and found sand in the streets and here and there a trace of a trolley track in the worn-out concrete. By and by, he came to the beachfront. The air was fresh, gulls rode the breezes, and Ramon felt unaccustomedly at peace in the wind-buffered sun with the blue seawater in his eyes. This feeling stayed with him as he wandered back into a local business district and saw the sign in Borislav’s window: “Dishwash Is Wanted.” He liked that locution, suggestive of a foreign tongue, and so he walked in and became a dishwash, only to rise to busboy, waiter, and married man. Then came the night that Borislav closed the restaurant to the public. Tables were pushed together, new linen was laid out, as well as cut-crystal glasses that Ramon had not seen before. A strange man arrived and strode into the kitchen. Jelena looked at Ramon in surprise, though Borislav, as well as his shrew of a wife, in a fancy dress and with her face made up, were clearly expecting this. He is the chef of this evening, Mrs. Borislav said. Ramon saw the chef’s imperious glance as he looked over the kitchen and the help, including the cooks. The chef shook his head in disapproval, then turned to Borislav and began giving orders.</p><p>The dinner party for which the entire restaurant had been reserved turned out to have just fourteen guests, all men. Apparently they liked a quiet room. Borislav had excused the staff for the evening, except for Ramon and Jelena. When Ramon began his service, with bottles of sparkling water, conversation stopped and a man at the head of the table looked at him. Ramon felt Borislav’s hand on his shoulder and heard his somewhat deferential voice saying, in its mouthful language, that the boy was O.K. because he was just a mestizo who didn’t understand a word—which Ramon, of course, understood, because the look he’d got from the head man and the jovially responsive voice of Borislav provided all the understanding necessary.</p><p>In the kitchen, Jelena<span data-page="page_5"></span> was nervous. Before the guests had arrived she’d gone to the alley with her cell phone and a man standing there had told her to go back inside.</p><p>Ramon, you know what they are? she whispered. Do you realize?</p><p>She held out her hands and they were shaking. Ramon fingered her wedding ring. When had she got it? He couldn’t keep from smiling.</p><p>You’ve been cleared for the evening, Jelena. You are family. Just don’t look at them. Keep your eyes down and be your efficient self and everything will be all right.</p><p>How do you know to be so calm? Jelena said.</p><p>I am familiar with the species.</p><p>When the dinner of the fourteen was over and the limos had driven off and the doors were closed for the night, Borislav and his wife poured themselves glasses of blackberry brandy and sat down in the back. A while later, the old lawyer was admitted and the three of them chatted softly, as if Ramon might overhear them. Jelena had gone home and Ramon was about to leave when Borislav called him to the table.</p><p>You did well, Ramon.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Sit, sit. The counsellor wants to speak with you.</p><p>The lawyer said, April 15th, as you know, is for paying taxes. As I suspect, your income is the poverty level?</p><p>Even counting tips, Ramon said.</p><p>You see how ungrateful? Mrs. Borislav said.</p><p>The lawyer continued, We assume the Immigration does not want Jelena, your wife, to be a ward of the state—this is their main concern for the green card, and so we are signing on Borislav, who is a man of substance, to be a co-sponsor of her.</p><p>Borislav nodded in solemn acknowledgment of his substance.</p><p>In that way, the Immigration is assured that Jelena does not apply for Welfare, though her husband is in the poverty class. And the arrangement is affirmed by Jelena living in the Borislav residence.</p><p>O.K. with me, Ramon said, rising.</p><p>One moment. Since as marriage partners you are to file a joint tax return, you and Jelena together, for this is what married people do, we find it necessary that you live with Borislav as well, in his house, and therefore with the same address on the tax return.</p><p>Is it not my house also? Anya Borislav said to the lawyer.</p><p>Of course, the lawyer said. My apologies.</p><p>So let him be grateful to me as well. That we are giving the mestizo everything, including a roof over his head. But I tell you, she said to Ramon, this is not a hotel and I am not a maid. You understand? Your bed you will make yourself, your room you will clean, and your wash you will take to the laundromat, and your food you will eat elsewhere.</p><p>Ramon ignored her. I have conditions, he said to the lawyer.</p><p>What conditions?</p><p>That the money I am owed is paid to me now.</p><p>Jelena has not been paying you? Borislav said.</p><p>No, nor have I asked her. She is my wife. Since we are married and filing a joint tax return it is not income if it is passed from one of us to the other. So I will need from you the money I’m owed before I consent to live in your house and suffer the insults of Mrs. Borislav.</p><p>At this the woman rose from the table and began to scream and curse in her native tongue. Spittle flew from her lips.</p><p>Borislav stood and tried to calm her, but she pushed his arm away and screamed at him. Anya, he said, please, please. We know what we are doing!</p><p>It was that remark that Ramon remembered later. Borislav and the lawyer had agreed to pay him the money. But what was it, exactly, that they knew they were doing?</p><p>Borislav’s house was of red brick with a roof of green tile. It stood out in this neighborhood of small two-family homes on small lots. The inside reflected the same taste—probably Mrs. Borislav’s—as the restaurant: heavy, dark furniture, thick rugs, lamps with tasselled shades, and toylike things on every surface, things of glass, things of silver, things of ceramic, dancing ladies in swirling skirts, horses pulling sleighs. Only when Ramon had climbed the stairs to the third floor did he find a window that was not heavily curtained. His room was across the hall from Jelena’s. It was small with a narrow bed and a chest of drawers, but its window was covered with only a pull shade, and when that was rolled up the seaside morning light streamed in so that he awoke with the sun on his face.</p><p>In secret, of course, he was excited to be living so close to Jelena. When it came time to walk home after work, they had the same destination. He opened the door with her key and walked behind her up the stairs and said good night only when they stood at their doors. There was a bathroom, too, that they shared and so he got to know the products she used for her hair, her skin, her eyes. Her potions, creams, sprays, and soaps gave him a behind-the-scenes look at how she took care of herself. With respect, he always put the seat down. And so he felt in this illusion of their intimacy something more like the married<span data-page="page_6"></span> state.</p><p>What puzzled him was her reaction to this closeness. He had expected her to object to having him as a housemate and to be even angrier and more remote than before. But she was not. She was formal, perhaps, but no longer offhand in her treatment of him. She regarded him judiciously as he spoke to her. And when it became apparent that Mrs. Borislav regularly checked his room and went through the entire house to see if he had stolen anything, Jelena told him this would be unforgivable if the woman were sane. Anya Borislav, Jelena confided, is not a little crazy. I don’t know how Borislav endures her.</p><p>One Monday morning, Jelena said, I’m going to the beach. Would you like to come with me? And so there he was applying sunblock to her thin back, while the gulls wheeled about and the little birds with stick legs went running along in the wet sand, just out of reach of the incoming tide. Jelena’s bathing suit hardly deserved the name, some bits of cloth and a strap or two. Ramon did not own a suit. He’d removed his shirt and rolled up his trousers. There were very few bathers this workday morning, but the beach was embellished with the refuse of the weekend past—hunks of charred firewood, beer bottles, McDonald’s wrappers, plastic bags, balls of aluminum foil, wet newspapers, and the occasional used condom. But they had found a reasonably clean spot, where Ramon had only to dispose of a few pieces of broken glass, and so here they were in the sun with the hushing waves rolling in and the gulls crying and Jelena’s vertebrae easily countable as she bent forward and he rubbed the sunblock over her back.</p><p>Afterward, they sat side by side on their towels and watched the waves.</p><p>Ramon, would you like to hit me?</p><p>No. Of course not. Jelena, what a strange thing to say. Why?</p><p>I have been rude to you when you have done something only for my sake. I would deserve it.</p><p>No, I understand your mind, Jelena. Nothing is settled for you. You are new in another country. You are loosely attached. My mother, just before she died, told me that she had never really got used to the States, though she’d lived most of her life here. Of course, everyone is different, but it takes time to make yourself American.</p><p>Well, if not you then someone will have to hit me. Maybe Alexander. He knows to do it.</p><p>Who hits you? Alexander? Is that your boyfriend?</p><p>Yes. In a way of speaking. But it is best if you hit me, Ramon.</p><p>She turned to him, removed her sunglasses, and he saw that she was crying. Forgive me, she said, I am the worst of people. I don’t know anymore what I am doing.</p><p>Ramon’s heart beat faster. Is Alexander coming here?</p><p>He says. But he speaks through Borislav. I am of no importance. Oh, I am so wretched, she said. And she got up and walked to the surf and stood there as, even in his misgiving, he recorded her lovely figure, the long legs, the small, firm haunches, the huddled shoulders as she stood at the water’s edge hugging herself.</p><p>Leon said, Ramon, you should talk to me first. You have made a mistake.</p><p>You know those people?</p><p>Of course. It is my business to know. When they came into his restaurant Borislav’s stature should have risen in your estimation to the level of the totally untrustworthy.</p><p>I am in love with Jelena.</p><p>It can be felt as love when you want to fuck someone and can’t.</p><p>We are man and wife. In my love for Jelena, I will fuck her.</p><p>You would have been better off still walking her to the door and leaving. Now you are in there with all of them and you are vulnerable.</p><p>What can they do?</p><p>They will speed things up. And you could be out on your ass with no job and a court appearance. And I am a busy man, Ramon. I don’t need this thing of my brother for our lawyers to divert themselves and the P.D. to smirk at.</p><p>I will not touch her.</p><p>They don’t need you to. You’re in the house, the husband, you’re right there—what is it your movie people say—on location? You’re on location, Ramon! It is a federal law—they made it to punish domestic violence against women. She gets hit and she gets the divorce right now, and the whole thing is done not in two years but in two weeks. And here is this Alexander flying in on her green card to be married.</p><p>She would have to bring charges against me. Jelena would not do that.</p><p>Oh, please, Ramon. What am I dealing with here? So they give her a couple of black eyes, a broken nose—you think she would like more of the same if she refused to bring charges?</p><p>None of this will happen, Leon. So, as I understand it, it’s not for Jelena, the daughter of Borislav’s late uncle, to make a better life for herself in America?</p><p>We’re still looking into that. It may be no more than what it seems. There are other ways to have got him in, long before this. So if they’ve taken these pains,<span data-page="page_final"></span> and it is not what it seems, we have something to learn. He hasn’t been a faithful boyfriend, we know that. Listen, Ramon, in the meantime just get out of there. Leave your clothes like you’re coming back. They’ll wait. They need you around to make the strongest case. You’ve got your cash. Let them look for you if they want to set you up.</p><p>They took their lunch to have on the beach. But it began to rain—a misty rain with the combers rolling in, and everything was gray, the sky, the seawater, and there was no line at the horizon.</p><p>They sat on the boardwalk with their bags of sandwiches and drinks on the bench between them. Jelena had pulled up the hood of her sweater. He could not see her face.</p><p>I love you, Jelena.</p><p>I know. You are reliable, Ramon. As a husband should be.</p><p>You’re making fun.</p><p>No. I have come to respect you. I find myself thinking about you without meaning to. You are very odd.</p><p>I made a decision to love you when Borislav showed me your picture and sent me to marry you.</p><p>A decision.</p><p>Yes, this was an arranged marriage, and they are the best, when the decision is to love someone you don’t know. Those have always been the most sacred, the marriages arranged before there is love and by other people.</p><p>The old way, from long ago, yes, and there is a good reason that it was given up.</p><p>Well, I know that my mother and father’s marriage was arranged by their parents. The two young people sat there in embarrassment while their families negotiated. They had not met before. My mother told me that. And she and my father were together for forty years. And when he died she wept, how she wept. Neither my brother nor I could console her.</p><p>Well, Ramon, that may be, but you and I have not sat in embarrassment while our parents negotiated. So where were the parents? It is a written green-card marriage, yours and mine.</p><p>But it is still a sacred bond. Whether the marriage is arranged by one’s parents or by a drunken idiot, with the bride kissing the wrong man, and all for the wrong reasons—it is the same. Whether through one’s family or out of a desire to go to another country, it is the same mysterious thing going on underneath, doing its work in the manner of fate. And once it is done there can have been no other thing.</p><p>That is very philosophical, Ramon. Your brother told me you are a graduate from college.</p><p>And there is the sea in front of us, Jelena, that you have come over, to be in this country. And so that’s the way it is.</p><p>Ramon carefully slipped her hood back and touched her cheek and she turned to face him. He leaned forward and kissed her lips.</p><p>Here is what we will do now, Jelena. We will find a taxicab and leave. Just the way we are. We will buy what we need in the city. I have money.</p><p>Ramon—</p><p>It is no longer safe for you here. Or for me. Come. Anyway, it is too cold here in the rain. Take the sandwiches. Aren’t you hungry? I am. We will eat on the way.</p><p>When Leon came in that evening, he found Ramon and Jelena standing at the window looking at the lights of the city. They were holding hands.</p><p>Leon coughed to get their attention. They were flustered, as if they’d been caught doing something forbidden.</p><p>Leon shook his head and smiled. Is this the lovely Jelena? So it is! Snatched from under their foreign eyes. Ah, my brother, he said, I should have known. I should have known.</p><p>Leon went behind the bar and brought out a bottle of champagne. Come, we’ll drink to it. He set out the glasses and popped the cork. Let the war begin, he said. ♦</p>	E. L.

Broccoli	<p>"Here’s <span data-page="page_1"></span>another one, seduced and abandoned,” Nina’s husband often said, pulling a bunch of wilted, yellowed broccoli from the refrigerator shelf. He held it, pinched between two fingers, his handsome face contorted in disgust, as though it smelled.</p><p>Nina, blushing, took the broccoli away from him and threw it in the garbage. She told him she was sorry; she had been busy all week and never had time to cook. Nina worked in Manhattan. By the time she got home to Brooklyn, it was already seven-thirty, sometimes eight, and the most she could do was make her husband and herself sandwiches, or boil some meat dumplings from a Russian supermarket.</p><p>“I know,” her husband said. “But why buy all these vegetables if you know you won’t have time to cook them?”</p><p>Nina shrugged. She liked shopping for vegetables.</p><p>She couldn’t say exactly when she’d first felt the urge—possibly two years earlier, on her second day in America, when she and her husband had left her sister’s Brooklyn apartment for the first time to explore the nearest shopping street. Nina’s sister, who’d lived in America for fourteen years and called herself an American, assumed that Nina would be impatient to see it. “Go, go,” she said. “But don’t buy anything. There are two rules you have to remember in order to survive in America. First: Never buy anything in expensive stores unless they’re having a fifty-per-cent-off sale. Second: Never buy anything in cheap stores.”</p><p>On the unimaginatively named Avenue M, Nina and her husband browsed through stores that all looked alike to them, no matter what was being sold: food, electronics, clothes, or hardware. They seemed to be walking in and out of the same store over and over, simply to hear the doorbell chime.</p><p>It was a pale, cold February morning, and Nina was hiding her reddened nose in the fur collar of her Russian coat. She clutched her husband’s elbow, stepping carefully over piles of garbage, reluctant to look up at the ashen sky or sideways at the motley signs of the shops. She was feeling dizzy and a little nauseated from the flight and the all-night talk with her sister that had followed. Only one store attracted her attention—a small Chinese grocery, with fruit and vegetables set outside on plywood stands. Colorful piles of oranges, tomatoes, cucumbers—everything was sparklingly clean and bright. Nina read the side of the box of tomatoes: “Sunripe.” She was still learning English, and every new expression seemed to her exciting and rich with meaning. “Sunripe” brought to mind a vegetable patch on a summer afternoon, the smell of dark soil heated by the sun, pale-green stems bent and bursting under the weight of juicy tomatoes. She wanted to touch the tomatoes in the box to see if their skin was still warm from the sun that shone on them as they ripened. She was just reaching out her hand when her husband pulled her away to another store.</p><p>Now Nina shopped for vegetables alone every Saturday morning—her husband loved to sleep late on weekends. She drove to Eighty-sixth Street and shopped in the Chinese and Russian stores between Bay Parkway and Twenty-third Avenue. The stores all offered pretty much the same selection of produce, but Nina liked to explore them all, in search of something surprising: the occasional white asparagus, plastic baskets of gooseberries, tiny, nutlike new potatoes. On the days when there was nothing new, it was still interesting to compare the stores. In one, the onions might be large and firm but the heads of lettuce wilted and colorless. Another might have the freshest greens and onions that were soft and gray, hiding timidly in string bags.</p><p>Nina felt a thrill as soon she got out of the car and placed her feet on the sidewalk, littered with torn lettuce leaves, onion peels, and overripe tomatoes. In the stores, she walked up and down the aisles, running her fingers over tomatoes as smooth and glossy as polished furniture. She cupped avocados, feeling their lumpy peel with her palms. Sometimes she dug a fingernail into the rind of an orange until it spat out a little of its pungent juice. She avoided touching the hairy, egg-shaped kiwis and the wormlike string beans, but she liked to stroke the feathery bunches of dill and parsley and squeeze the artichokes, which felt like soft pine cones. She patted cantaloupes and she tapped watermelons with her index finger, listening to the hollow sound they made. But, most of all, Nina loved broccoli. It smelled of young spring grass, and it looked like a tree, with its hard solid stem and its luxuriant crown of tight, grainy florets.</p><p>Nina bought a bunch of broccoli every week, along with various other vegetables. She carried big brown bags to her car, firmly believing that this weekend she would find time to cook. There was still Saturday afternoon ahead, and then all of Sunday. She would wash the vegetables as soon as she got home and then cook something with them—spinach gnocchi, maybe, or grilled zucchini parcels, or three-cheese broccoli gratin.</p><p>But as soon as she got home Nina found herself in a whirl of things to do. She had to shower, curl her hair, brush it out if it started to go frizzy, try on and reject several sweaters and pairs of pants, put on makeup,<span data-page="page_2"></span> find her husband’s missing sock, iron his shirt, check that the gas was off, and lock the door. It seemed only minutes before she found herself in the car again, on the way to a party, glancing back and forth between her husband in the driver’s seat and her own reflection in the mirror on the sun visor. Her husband was deep in his thoughts, which was natural, Nina told herself, since he was driving. And her reflection was unsatisfying—despite her efforts, her hair was still frizzy, her soft-featured, round face was poorly made up, and her blue angora sweater was too tight around the armpits. Clothes bought at fifty-per-cent-off sales were always either the wrong size or the wrong style.</p><p>In the car, Nina rarely thought about her vegetables. They lay abandoned on the cramped refrigerator shelves: tomatoes buried under zucchinis, lettuce leaves caught in the edge of the vegetable drawer, a bunch of broccoli that wouldn’t fit in the drawer sitting by itself on the third shelf.</p><p>The parties were thrown by Pavlik, a friend of Nina’s husband from work, whose wife had divorced him a few years earlier. Pavlik was a heavy man with an uneven ginger-colored beard. He wore ill-fitting trousers and shirts that never seemed clean. He loved to laugh heartily and smack his friends on the back. “Don’t mind the mess!” he yelled as his guests wandered through the dusty labyrinth of his house, stumbling over secondhand furniture, broken electronic equipment, and heavy volumes of Russian literature. It seemed to Nina that Pavlik’s functions as a host were limited to calling out that phrase. He didn’t feed or entertain his guests. People arrived with their own food and wine, their own plastic dinnerware, their own guitars, and sometimes their own poems, written on scraps of notebook paper.</p><p>None of Pavlik’s guests were professional poets or musicians. Most of them worked as computer programmers, an occupation that they had taken up in America, where they found it easier and more profitable than trying to prove the value of their Russian degrees in science or the arts. Some of them, Nina’s husband included, adopted a condescending attitude toward their new profession: it was boring; it was beneath them. “Computer programming, like everyone else,” they answered reluctantly when asked their occupation, “but that’s not what I did in my previous life.” They preferred to talk about art or music or such exciting hobbies as alpinism, rafting, and photographing Alaskan sunsets.</p><p>Nina was a computer programmer, too, but she had always been a computer programmer. She didn’t know much about poetry or music, and she didn’t have any exciting talents or hobbies.</p><p>“My wife is a vegetable lover,” Nina’s husband would say, introducing her to Pavlik’s circle.</p><p>Nina didn’t like Pavlik’s guests. The men were untidy and unattractive. They loaded their paper plates with cold cuts and smoked too much. They said the same things over and over, and it seemed to Nina that there was always a piece of ham or salami hanging out of their mouths when they talked.</p><p>The women, with one or two exceptions, were attractive, but in an unpleasant way. They were thin and sophisticated; they had straight hair; they had strong hands with long, powerful fingers, toughened by playing piano or guitar; they had soulful eyes, saddened by all the poetry they’d read; they had mysterious expressions of eternal fatigue. They had everything that Nina lacked.</p><p>Nina usually spent the evening in one corner of Pavlik’s stiff sofa, away from her husband and the other guests, who sat on the floor by the cold fireplace. The sound of their laughter, their singing, and their reading floated around the room, but didn’t seem to reach Nina. The food and wine, arranged on a rickety folding table by the window, were more accessible. She made frequent trips to that table, where the cold cuts were spread out on paper plates, loaves of bread sat on cutting boards, and pickles swam in glass jars. There were usually a few unopened bottles of vodka and a five-litre box of Burgundy or Chablis. The wine dripped from a little plastic faucet onto the beige carpet, forming intricate patterns, so that by the end of the party Pavlik’s modest floor covering looked like a fancy Turkish rug.</p><p>When Nina and her husband first started coming to Pavlik’s parties, she had joined the others by the fireplace. She’d loved to sit across from her husband and watch his face as he played the guitar. His head tilted forward, and the bangs of his dark hair fell to his half-closed eyes. From time to time, he glanced at her, and his eyes flickered through the forest of his hair like two fireflies. At those moments, Nina felt that he was playing for her alone, and the music touched her, making her skin prickle and her throat hurt.</p><p>With time, though, Nina noticed that she wasn’t the only person watching her husband as he played. Other women watched, too, and in exactly the same way. Nina saw how their faces lit up under his fleeting gaze, just as hers did. Those women probably felt that he was playing for them, too, and sometimes Nina thought that they had more right to be played for by her husband than she did. When they looked over at Nina, she felt as if<span data-page="page_3"></span> she were expanding, bloating, metamorphosing into an oversized exhibit of a dull, talentless woman with the wrong clothes and the wrong makeup. She knew that they were all asking themselves why this interesting, talented man had married her. Her sister didn’t ask. “You were his ticket to America,” she reminded Nina frequently. “Can you disprove that?”</p><p>Nina couldn’t. It was true that her husband had always wanted to emigrate but, without close relatives in the United States, hadn’t been able to obtain a visa. It was true that, having married Nina, he had got his visa. It was true that Nina hadn’t wanted to emigrate but had yielded to her husband’s wishes. It wasn’t true, though, that he had married Nina for those reasons alone, and it wasn’t true that he didn’t love her. Nina’s sister didn’t know what Nina knew. She didn’t know that when Nina had been in the hospital with appendicitis her husband hadn’t left her room for even a minute. She had begged him to go and get some coffee or a breath of fresh air, but he had stayed with her. He’d held Nina’s hand and squeezed it involuntarily every time she moaned. Nina’s sister also didn’t know how he’d sometimes hug Nina from behind and bury his face in her hair and whisper, “There is nothing like this. Nothing in the world.” She could feel his sharp nose and his hot breath on the nape of her neck, and her eyes filled with tears. Nina’s sister didn’t know that he often said the same words when they were making love.</p><p>It was a relief to come home after the parties and find herself in bed with a book, next to her husband. Nina’s nightstand was piled with cookbooks, bought at a fifty-per-cent discount at Barnes &amp; Noble. She read lying on her back, resting the book on her stomach. The thick, glossy pages rustled against her satin nightgowns, bought at a fifty-per-cent-off sale at Victoria’s Secret. She loved that sound as much as she loved the prickly sensation on the soles of her feet when they brushed up against her husband’s hairy legs. And she loved the euphoric feeling she got when she looked at lustrous photographs of okra-and-tomato stew in rustic clay bowls, baskets of fresh vegetables shot against a background of meadows or olive groves. In her favorite book, “Italian Cuisine: The Taste of the Sun,” there were also images of the cooking process. In those photographs, smooth, light-skinned female hands with evenly trimmed fingernails performed magical actions on vegetables. The hands looked like Nina’s hands, and Nina fantasized that they were her hands. That it was she who had made those perfectly curled carrot strips. It was she who had pushed the stubborn stuffing inside the bell peppers. It was she who had rinsed the grit off the greens and chopped the broccoli, scattering tiny green seeds all over the table. Nina’s lips moved to form the almost passionate words of the cooking instructions. “Brush with olive oil,” “Bring to a boil and simmer gently,” “Scoop out the pulp,” “Peel,” “Chop,” “Slice,” “Crush.” When she put the book away and stretched out against her husband’s back, her lips continued moving for some time.</p><p>Nina’s husband left her at the end of the summer, just as the tomatoes and the peaches were performing their yearly invasion of the fruit-and-vegetable stores on Eighty-sixth Street. Nina’s refrigerator was full of them when her sister opened it.</p><p>“The fifth week is the worst,” Nina’s sister was saying. “The first four weeks it hasn’t sunk in yet—you feel the shock, but you don’t feel the pain. It’s like you’re numb. But the fifth week . . . Brace yourself for the fifth week.” She crouched by the refrigerator, unloading the food she had brought over. She had come to console Nina with four large bags from a Russian supermarket. Nina felt tired. She sat at the table, staring at her sister’s broad back. She was thinking that if you banged on it with a hammer it would produce a loud, reverberating sound, as if it were made of hard wood. The refrigerator shelves filled quickly: cartons of currant juice (“Currant juice saved my life—I basically lived on it when Volodya left me”), cream cheese, farmer’s cheese, soft cheese, Swiss cheese, bread, pickles, a jar of cherry compote.</p><p>“Nina!” her sister shrieked. “What is that?” She had pulled out the vegetable drawer. Inside, there was a pile of old tomatoes, with white beards of mold growing in the places where their skins had split; there were peaches covered with brown spots; there were dark and slimy bunches of collard greens. “You’ve got a whole vegetable graveyard in here,” Nina’s sister grumbled, emptying the drawer into the garbage. The vegetables made squelching sounds as they landed.</p><p>A faint rotten smell stayed in the kitchen for a long time after Nina’s sister had left. It wasn’t unpleasant. It was the simple, cozy smell of a kitchen, the smell of vegetable soup simmering on the stove, the kind that her mother used to make.</p><p>Contrary to her sister’s prediction, the fifth week didn’t bring Nina any extreme pain. It only added to the fatigue. She felt as if she were recovering from a long, exhausting illness. She tried to do as few household chores as possible. She didn’t shop<span data-page="page_4"></span> for vegetables anymore. She still read her cookbooks after work, but she was too tired to do much more than scan the index. She ran her finger over the smooth pages and neat columns of tiny letters. The austere phrases were logical and easy to read. “Broccoli: gratin—17; macaroni with—72; penne and—78.” She had no desire to look up the recipes. She just went on to the next entry. “Eggplant: braised chicken with onions and—137; and tomato, baked—162.” “Zucchini: and mushrooms, sautéed—34; shredded, jasmine rice with—201; soup—41; stuffed—57.”</p><p>Pavlik’s booming voice on the answering machine broke into the elegant sequence of artichoke recipes. Nina had turned off the ringer on her phone weeks before, and now she listened to the messages as they came through her old scratchy answering machine. Most of them were from her sister, calling to ask if she was eating well and to tell her the latest news: that Nina’s husband had been spotted on Brighton Beach with some “dried herring,” that he was moving to Boston, that he had already moved. Nina’s sister’s voice seemed to her distant and somewhat unnatural. Pavlik’s voice made her jump. “Hey! Nina! Are you home?” he shouted. On impulse, Nina looked at the front door. It was hard to believe that the roaring was coming from the modest plastic box on the wall. Then Pavlik’s voice dropped too low, and it was hard to make out his words. “Don’t disappear,” he said, if Nina heard him correctly.</p><p>Pavlik’s place looked different. Nina realized it as soon as she stepped into the living room, but she couldn’t quite figure out how it was different. The rickety table still stood on the stained rug, the fireplace was stacked with old magazines, Pavlik’s big frame was shaking with laughter, the vacant sofa was waiting for Nina. Everything was there, everything was in place, and yet something had undeniably changed. “The size—it’s become bigger,” Nina decided, taking her seat in the corner of the sofa. Pavlik’s house had more space and more air than it had had before.</p><p>A thin, delicate woman with a guitar was singing something about a little path in the woods that meandered through the trees. Nina liked the song. When it ended, the singer put the guitar down and walked to the food table. She was wearing a long blue cardigan with drooping pockets. There was nothing mysterious about her. A man with receding hair and a closely trimmed gray beard took over the guitar. Nina’s eyes travelled from the man’s moving, outstretched elbow, protruding through his shabby corduroy sleeve, to his hunched shoulders and the greasy line of his hair. She suddenly understood that his untidiness wasn’t a kind of snobbish fashion statement but a sign of loneliness, of neglect. She saw that the women sitting in a circle were watching the man, just as they had watched her husband. They were tired, lonely women, just like her. There was nothing mysterious about them, either. Nina also noticed that she wasn’t the only one sitting outside the circle. In fact, there were only a few people in it. Others were scattered all around Pavlik’s house. She could see lonely figures here and there, sitting quietly on a chair, an old box, a windowsill, or wandering through the house. From time to time, the paths of the lonely figures intersected and then conversations were struck up. Awkward yet hopeful conversations, just like the one that Nina was having now.</p><p>“You’re a vegetable lover, aren’t you?” asked a man who had seated himself in the opposite corner of Nina’s sofa. Nina nodded. “I thought I heard that from somebody. Do you like to cook vegetables?” Nina nodded again. “You know, I love vegetables, myself. My wife hates it when I cook, though.” The man rolled his eyes, making Nina smile. He was short, with thin rusty-red hair and a very pale complexion. He had a tiny piece of toilet paper with a spot of dried blood stuck to his cheek.</p><p>“Are you a computer programmer like everyone else?” Nina asked. The man nodded with a smile. “And in your previous life?”</p><p>“A high-school physics teacher. But I can’t say that I miss it. I used to be terrified of my students.”</p><p>Nina laughed. He was easy to talk to. She looked at his smiling eyes, then down at his hands—white fingers, short fingernails, red hair on the knuckles. She tried to imagine what it would be like if one of these hands were to accidentally brush against her breast.</p><p>Nina wiped the little beads of sweat off her nose. He was a strange, married, not particularly attractive man.</p><p>“So what’s your favorite vegetable?” she asked.</p><p>“Probably fennel. Fennel has an incredible flavor, reminds me of a wild apple and, oddly enough, freshly sawed wood. Do you like fennel?”</p><p>Nina nodded. She liked fennel: it had a funny, slightly ribbed surface, it was heavy, it had weird green shoots that seemed to grow out of nowhere. Nina had never tasted fennel. “I like broccoli,” she said.</p><p>“Oh, broccoli! I love how they cook it in Chinese places. How do you cook it?” The man with the piece of tissue stuck to his cheek looked safe enough to confide in.</p><p>“I’ve never cooked broccoli, or any other vegetable,” Nina said.</p><p>Nina spent the better part of the following Saturday<span data-page="page_final"></span> shopping for cooking utensils. “Let’s have a cooking date,” the man from the party had suggested. A cooking date. Nina was sure that, at some point in the past, she had been as excited as she was now, but she couldn’t remember when. She went to Macy’s and, breaking the fifty-per-cent-discount rule for the first time, bought two drastically overpriced skillets, a set of shiny stainless-steel saucepans, a steamer, and a pretty wooden spoon with a carved handle. “Do you want wedding gift wrap?” the cashier asked.</p><p>Halfway home, Nina realized that she hadn’t bought nearly enough. Knives! She needed knives, and a cutting board, and a colander, and God knew what else. She swerved her car in the direction of Avenue M, where, breaking the rule about never buying anything in the cheap stores, she bought a set of knives, two cutting boards—one wooden and one plastic—a colander, a curved grapefruit knife, because it looked so cute, a vegetable peeler, a set of stainless-steel bowls, and two aprons with pictures of wild mushrooms on yellow backgrounds. In a grocery store next door, Nina bought olive oil, black pepper, chili pepper, and a jar of dry dark-green stuff with Chinese characters on the label.</p><p>By two-thirty—half an hour before the man was due to arrive—Nina had everything ready. The sparkling saucepans and the skillet stood proudly on the stove, and the bowls, the colander, the cutting boards, and the knives were arranged on the kitchen counter in careful disarray around the centerpiece: “Italian Cuisine: The Taste of the Sun.” Nina observed her kitchen, trying to shake off her embarrassing excess of excitement.</p><p>The man came on time, early even. At five to three, he stood in Nina’s hallway, removing his bulky leather jacket and cap, sprinkled with raindrops. He smelled of wet leather. He handed Nina a bottle of wine and a baguette in a sodden paper bag.</p><p>“In the movies, when a man hands a woman a baguette and a bottle of wine, it always seems chic, doesn’t it?” he asked.</p><p>Nina nodded. He was more homely than she remembered. Her memory had somehow managed to erase the red spots on his pasty cheeks, to color his brows and eyelashes, to make him slimmer and add an inch or two to his height. It was strange to see him in her house, especially in her tiny hallway, where every object was familiar, its position carefully chosen. He clashed with the surroundings like a mismatched piece of furniture. Nina quickly led him into the kitchen.</p><p>“So, are we cooking broccoli today?” the man asked, leafing through “Italian Cuisine: The Taste of the Sun,” his freshly washed hands still smelling of Nina’s soap.</p><p>“Broccoli, yes,” Nina mumbled, suddenly struck by a dreadful suspicion, which she confirmed on opening the refrigerator. She had forgotten to buy the vegetables.</p><p>She jerked out the vegetable drawer, hoping for a miracle. It was empty and clean, wiped down with a kitchen towel dipped in Clorox by Nina’s sister’s firm hand. There was only a tiny strip of onion skin stuck between the edge of the drawer and the shelf above. Nina turned to the man, motioning to the empty drawer; she found it hard to speak, as if someone were squeezing her throat. Everything seemed hopeless and ridiculous. The counter crammed with its gleaming kitchenware. The barren vegetable drawer. This perfect stranger, who had come to cook in her kitchen. Nina herself, her energy drained away, standing now with her forehead pressed to the cold rubber lining of the refrigerator door.</p><p>“Do you want me to go to the supermarket?” the man asked. Nina shook her head. Now that everything had been exposed to her in all its absurdity, she knew that it would never work.</p><p>A bunch of broccoli was stuck between the third shelf and the back of the refrigerator. It hung upside down, the florets nearly touching the shelf below. The man saw it first and pointed it out to Nina. The broccoli wasn’t yellow or covered with slime. During the weeks that it had hung between the shelves, it had become darker and dryer. In a few more weeks it would have become a broccoli mummy. It smelled all right—or, rather, it didn’t smell of anything.</p><p>“I’m sure we can still cook it,” the man said.</p><p>Nina ran cold water over the florets, then shook the bunch fiercely, letting out a shower of green drops. She chopped off the stem, then cut off the base of each floret, watching with fascination as each piece split into tiny new bunches of broccoli. She peeled the stem and cut it into even, star-shaped slices. Some things turned out to be different from her cooking fantasies, others exactly the same. Some were disappointing, others better than she had ever imagined. Then, when the broccoli was in the pot on the stove, boiling water sputtering under the saucepan’s shiny lid, the man suggested that Nina move one of her kitchen chairs closer to the stove and stand on it. “Climb up and inhale,” the man said. “The hot air travels up. The strongest aroma should be right under the ceiling.”</p><p>Nina stood on the chair, her hair almost touching the ceiling, her eyes closed, her face pointed upward, her nostrils dilated. The warm smell of broccoli rose, caressing her face, enveloping her whole. ♦</p>	Lara Vapnyar	January 5, 2004 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/01/05/broccoli	Breakups	Broccoli	Brooklyn	Cooking	Immigrants	Marriage	Nina	Third	Immigrants
Brotherly Love	<p>East of the Tolly Club, after Deshapran Sashmal Road splits in two, there is a small mosque. A turn leads to a quiet enclave. A warren of narrow lanes and modest middle-class homes.</p><p>Once, within this enclave, there were two ponds, oblong, side by side. Behind them was a lowland spanning a few acres.</p><p>After the monsoon, the ponds would rise so that the embankment built between them could not be seen. The lowland also filled with rain, three or four feet deep, the water remaining for a portion of the year.</p><p>The flooded plain was thick with water hyacinth. The floating weed grew aggressively. Its leaves caused the surface to appear solid—green in contrast to the blue of the sky.</p><p>Simple huts stood here and there along the periphery. The poor waded in to forage for what was edible. In autumn, egrets arrived, their white feathers darkened by the city’s soot, waiting motionless for their prey.</p><p>In the humid climate of Calcutta, evaporation was slow. But eventually the sun burned off most of the floodwater, exposing damp ground again.</p><p>So many times Subhash and Udayan had walked across the lowland. It was a shortcut to a field on the outskirts of the neighborhood, where they went to play football. Avoiding puddles, stepping over mats of hyacinth leaves that remained in place, breathing the dank air.</p><p>They’d never set foot in the Tolly Club, although they’d passed by its wooden gate, its brick walls, hundreds of times.</p><p>Until the mid-forties, their father used to watch horses racing around its track. He’d watched from the street, standing among the bettors and other spectators unable to afford a ticket or to enter the club’s grounds. But after the Second World War, around the time Subhash and Udayan were born, the height of the wall was raised, so that the public could no longer see in.</p><p>Bismillah, a neighbor, worked as a caddy at the club. He was a Muslim who had stayed on in Tollygunge after Partition. For a few paise he sold them golf balls that had been lost or abandoned on the course. Some were sliced like a gash in one’s skin, revealing a pink rubbery interior.</p><p>At first they hit the dimpled balls back and forth with sticks. Then Bismillah sold them a putting iron with a shaft that was slightly bent. A frustrated player had damaged it, striking it against a tree. Bismillah showed them how to lean forward, where to place their hands. Loosely determining the objective of the game, they dug holes in the dirt and tried to coax the balls in. But golf wasn’t like football or cricket—it was not a sport the brothers could satisfactorily improvise.</p><p>In the dirt of the playing field Bismillah scratched out a map of the Tolly Club. He told them about the swimming pool, the stables, the tennis court. Restaurants where tea was poured from silver pots, special rooms in the clubhouse for billiards and bridge. Gramophones playing music. Bartenders in white coats who prepared drinks called pink lady and gin fizz.</p><p>The club’s management had recently put up more boundary walls, to keep intruders away. But Bismillah said that there were still sections along the western edge where one might enter.</p><p>They waited until close to dusk, when the golfers headed off the course to avoid the mosquitoes. They kept the plan to themselves, not mentioning it to the other boys in the neighborhood. They walked to the mosque at their corner, its red-and-white minarets distinct from the surrounding buildings. They turned onto the main road carrying the putting iron, and two empty kerosene tins.</p><p>They headed toward the paddy fields where the Adi Ganga once flowed, where the British had once sailed boats to the delta.</p><p>These days it was stagnant, lined with settlements of Hindus who’d fled from Dhaka, from Rajshahi, from Chittagong. A displaced population that Calcutta accommodated but ignored. Since Partition, a decade ago, they had overwhelmed parts of Tollygunge, the way monsoon rain obscured the lowland.</p><p>A rapid trickle, then a flood. Subhash and Udayan remembered it. A grim procession, a human herd. A few bundles on their heads, infants strapped to parents’ chests. They lived without sanitation, without electricity. In shanties next to garbage heaps, in any available space.</p><p>Subhash and Udayan stopped at a spot where the wall was low enough to scale. They were wearing shorts. Their pockets were stuffed with golf balls. Bismillah said they would find plenty more inside the club.</p><p>Udayan flung the putting iron over the wall. Then one of the kerosene tins. Standing on the remaining tin would give Subhash enough leverage to make it over. But Udayan was a few inches shorter in those days.</p><p>Lace your fingers, Udayan said.</p><p>Subhash brought his hands together. He felt the weight of his brother’s foot, the worn sole of his sandal, then his whole body, bearing down for an instant. Quickly Udayan hoisted himself up. He straddled the wall.</p><p>Should I stand guard on this side while you explore? Subhash asked him.</p><p>What fun would that be?</p><p>What do you see?</p><p>Come see for yourself.</p><p>Subhash nudged the kerosene tin closer to the wall. He stepped onto it, feeling the hollow structure wobble beneath him.</p><p>Let’s go, Subhash.</p><p>Udayan readjusted himself, dropping down so that only his fingertips were visible. Then he<span data-page="page_2"></span> released his hands and fell. Subhash could hear him breathing hard from the effort.</p><p>You’re all right?</p><p>Of course. Now you.</p><p>Subhash gripped the wall with his hands, hugging it to his chest, scraping his knees. As usual, he was uncertain whether he was more frustrated by Udayan’s daring or with himself for his lack of it. Subhash was thirteen, older by fifteen months. But he had no sense of himself without Udayan. From his earliest memories, at every point his brother was there.</p><p>Suddenly, they were no longer in Tollygunge. They could hear the traffic continuing down the street but could not see it. They were surrounded by massive trees: cannonball and eucalyptus, bottlebrush and frangipani.</p><p>Subhash had never seen such grass, as uniform as a carpet, unfurled over sloping contours of earth. Undulating like dunes in a desert, or gentle dips and swells in a sea. It was shorn so finely on the putting green that it felt like moss when he pressed against it.</p><p>They were both giddy from the thrill of trespassing, from the fear of being caught. But no guard on foot or horseback, no groundsman spotted them. No one came to chase them away.</p><p>They kept far from the main entrance, not venturing toward the clubhouse, where foreign couples walked arm in arm or sat on cane chairs under the trees. From time to time, Bismillah had said, there was a birthday party for the child of a British family, with ice cream and pony rides, a cake on which candles burned. Though Nehru was Prime Minister, it was the new Queen of England, Elizabeth II, whose portrait presided in the main drawing room.</p><p>In their neglected corner, Udayan swung forcefully. Raising his arms over his head, assuming poses, brandishing the putting iron like a sword. He broke apart the pristine turf, losing a few golf balls in one of the bodies of water. They searched in the rough for replacements.</p><p>Subhash was the lookout, listening for the approach of horses’ hooves on the broad red-dirt paths. He heard the taps of a woodpecker. The faint strikes of a sickle as a section of grass elsewhere in the club was trimmed by hand.</p><p>Groups of jackals sat erect in packs, their tawny hides mottled with gray. As the light dwindled, a few began to search for food. Their distraught howling, echoing within the club, signalled that it was late, time for the brothers to go home.</p><p>They left the two kerosene tins, the one on the outside to mark the place. They made sure to hide the one inside the club behind some shrubbery.</p><p>On subsequent visits, Subhash collected feathers and wild almonds. He saw vultures bathing in puddles, spreading their wings to dry. Once, he found an egg that had dropped, intact, from a warbler’s nest. Carefully, he carried it home with him, placing it in a terra-cotta container from a sweet shop, covering it with twigs. Digging a hole for it in the garden behind their house, at the base of the mango tree, when the egg did not hatch.</p><p>Then one evening, throwing over the putting iron from inside the club, climbing back over the wall, they noticed that the tin on the other side was missing.</p><p>Someone took it, Udayan said. He started to search. The light was scant.</p><p>Is this what you boys are looking for?</p><p>It was a policeman, appearing from nowhere, patrolling the area around the club.</p><p>He took a few steps toward them. Spotting the putting iron on the ground, he picked it up, inspecting it. He switched on a flashlight, focussing its beam on each of their faces, then down the length of their bodies.</p><p>Brothers?</p><p>Subhash nodded.</p><p>What’s in your pockets?</p><p>They removed the golf balls and surrendered them. They watched the policeman put them in his own pockets. He kept one out, tossing it into the air and catching it in his hand.</p><p>How did you come to acquire these?</p><p>They were silent.</p><p>Someone invited you today, to play golf at the club?</p><p>They shook their heads.</p><p>You don’t need me to tell you that these grounds are restricted, the policeman said. He rested the shaft of the putting iron lightly against Subhash’s arm.</p><p>Was this your idea? Aren’t you old enough to know better?</p><p>It was my idea, Udayan said.</p><p>You have a loyal brother, the policeman said to Subhash. Wanting to protect you. Willing to take the blame.</p><p>I’ll do you a favor this time, he continued. I won’t mention it to the club. As long as you don’t intend to try it again.</p><p>We won’t return, Subhash said.</p><p>Very well. Shall I escort you home to your parents or should we conclude our conversation here?</p><p>Here.</p><p>Turn around, then. Only you.</p><p>Subhash faced the wall.</p><p>Take another step.</p><p>He felt the steel shaft striking his haunches, then the backs of his legs. The force of the second blow, only an instant of contact, brought him to his hands and knees. It would take days for the welts to go down.</p><p>Their parents had never beaten them. He felt nothing at first, only numbness. Then a sensation that was like boiling water tossed from a pan against his skin.</p><p>Stop it, Udayan shouted to the policeman. He crouched next to Subhash, throwing an arm across his<span data-page="page_3"></span> shoulders, attempting to shield him. Together, pressed against each other, they braced themselves. But nothing more happened. They heard the sound of the putting iron being tossed over the wall, landing a final time inside the club. Then the policeman, who wanted nothing more to do with them, retreating.</p><p>Since childhood, Subhash had been cautious. His mother never had to run after him. He kept her company, watching as she cooked or sewed.</p><p>While Subhash stayed in clear view, Udayan was disappearing: even in their two-room house, when he was a boy, he hid compulsively, under the bed, behind the doors, in the crate where winter quilts were stored.</p><p>He played this game without announcing it, spontaneously vanishing, sneaking into the back garden, climbing into a tree, forcing their mother, when she called and he did not answer, to stop what she was doing. As she looked for him, as she humored him and called his name, Subhash saw the momentary panic in her face, that perhaps she would not find him.</p><p>When they were old enough, when they were permitted to leave the house, they were told not to lose sight of each other. Together they wandered down the winding lanes of the enclave, across the lowland, to the playing field, where they sometimes met up with other boys. They went to the mosque at the corner, to sit on the cool of its marble steps, listening to a football game on someone’s shortwave.</p><p>Eventually, they were allowed to leave the enclave and to enter the greater city. To board trams and buses by themselves. They began to linger outside Technicians’ Studio, where Bengali film stars spent their days. They caught sight of the actors and actresses as they emerged from their dressing rooms or stepped into waiting cars. Udayan was the one brave enough to ask them for autographs. He was blind to self-constraints, like an animal incapable of perceiving certain colors.</p><p>In spite of their differences, one was perpetually confused with the other, so that when either name was called both were conditioned to answer. They were similar enough in build to draw from a single pile of clothes. Their complexions, a light coppery compound derived from their parents, were identical. Their double-jointed fingers, the sharp cut of their features, the wavy texture of their hair.</p><p>Subhash wondered if his placid nature was regarded as a lack of inventiveness, perhaps even a failing, in his parents’ eyes. His parents did not have to worry about him, and yet they did not favor him. It became his mission to obey them, given that it wasn’t possible to surprise or impress them. That was what Udayan did.</p><p>Subhash might have started school a year earlier. But for the sake of convenience—also because Udayan had protested at the notion of Subhash going without him—they were put into the same class at the same time. A Bengali medium school for boys from ordinary families, beyond the tram depot, past the Christian cemetery.</p><p>In matching notebooks, they summarized the history of India, the founding of Calcutta. They drew maps to learn the geography of the world.</p><p>In high school the brothers studied optics and forces, the atomic numbers of the elements, the properties of light and sound. They learned about Hertz’s discovery of electromagnetic waves and Marconi’s experiments with wireless transmissions.</p><p>Each evening, at opposite sides of a metal table, they sat with their textbooks, copybooks, pencils, and erasers, a chess game in progress at the same time. They stayed up late, working on equations and formulas. It was quiet enough at night to hear the jackals howling in the Tolly Club. At times, they were still awake when the crows began quarrelling, signalling the start of another day.</p><p>Udayan wasn’t afraid to contradict their teachers about hydraulics, about plate tectonics. He gesticulated to illustrate his points, to emphasize his opinions, the vivid interplay of his hands suggesting that molecules and particles were within his grasp. At times, he was asked by their Sirs to step outside the room, told that he was holding up his classmates, when in fact he’d moved beyond them.</p><p>After studying basic circuitry, Udayan familiarized himself with the wiring system of their home. One day, he set about installing a buzzer for the house. He mounted a transformer on the fuse box and a black button to push by the main door. Hammering a hole in the wall, he fed wires through. Once the buzzer was in place, Udayan said they should use it to practice Morse code. Finding a book about telegraphy at a library, he wrote out two copies of the dots and dashes that corresponded to the letters of the alphabet, one for each of them to consult.</p><p>They concocted scenarios, pretending to be soldiers or spies in distress. Covertly communicating from a mountain pass in China, a Russian forest, a cane field in Cuba.</p><p>Ready?</p><p>Clear.</p><p>Coördinates?</p><p>Unknown.</p><p>Survivors?</p><p>Two.</p><p>Losses?</p><p>Pressing the buzzer, they would tell each other that they were hungry, that they should play football, that a pretty girl had just passed the house.</p><p>They were admitted to two of the city’s best colleges. Udayan to Presidency to study physics. Subhash, for chemical engineering, to Jadavpur. They were the only boys in their neighborhood, the only students from their unremarkable high school, to have done so well.<span data-page="page_4"></span></p><p>Their father had started working at nineteen to help support his family. Not having a college degree was his sole regret. He had a clerical position with the Indian Railways. As word spread of his sons’ success, he said he could no longer step outside the house without being stopped and congratulated.</p><p>Asked what they wanted as a celebratory gift, Subhash suggested a new chess set. Udayan said a shortwave radio. He wanted more news of the world than what was printed in the daily Bengali paper, rolled slim as a twig and thrown over the courtyard wall in the mornings.</p><p>They put it together themselves, searching in New Market, in junk shops, finding parts from Indian Army surplus. When it was finally assembled, it looked like a little suitcase, with a squared-off handle. Made of metal, bound in black. They took turns sitting by the window, holding the receiver in their hands, adjusting the antenna, manipulating two controls at once.</p><p>They searched for any foreign signal. News bulletins from Radio Moscow, Voice of America, the BBC. They heard arbitrary information, snippets from thousands of miles away, emerging from great thickets of interference that tossed like an ocean, that wavered like a wind.</p><p>It was 1964. The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution authorized America to use military force against North Vietnam. In Calcutta another wave of riots between Muslims and Hindus killed more than a hundred people after a relic was stolen from a mosque in Srinagar. Among the Communists in India there was dissent over the border war with China two years before. A breakaway group, sympathetic to China, called itself the Communist Party of India, Marxist: the C.P.I.(M.).</p><p>In the mornings, now that they were beginning to shave, they held up a hand mirror and a pan of warm water for each other in the courtyard.</p><p>On separate sides of the city, they made different friends, mixing with boys who’d gone to English medium schools. They took exams on different schedules, studying with different professors, running different experiments in their labs.</p><p>Because Udayan’s campus was farther away, it took him longer to get home. The battered chessboard stood neglected on the study table, until Subhash began to play against himself. Still, each day of his life began and ended with Udayan beside him.</p><p>In 1967, in the papers and on All India Radio, they started hearing about a place called Naxalbari. It was one of a string of villages in the Darjeeling District, a narrow corridor at the northern tip of West Bengal. Tucked into the foothills of the Himalayas, nearly four hundred miles from Calcutta, closer to Tibet than to Tollygunge.</p><p>Most of the villagers were tribal peasants who worked on tea plantations and large estates. For generations, they’d lived under a feudal system that hadn’t substantially changed. They were manipulated by wealthy landowners. They were pushed off fields they’d cultivated, denied revenue from crops they’d grown.</p><p>That March, when a sharecropper in Naxalbari tried to plow land from which he’d been illegally evicted, his landlord sent thugs to beat him. The police had refused to intervene. After this, groups of sharecroppers began retaliating. They started burning deeds and records that had cheated them. Forcibly occupying land.</p><p>It wasn’t the first instance of peasants in the Darjeeling District revolting. But this time their tactics were militant. Armed with primitive weapons, carrying red flags, shouting “Long Live Mao Tse-tung.”</p><p>Two Bengali Communists, Charu Majumdar and Kanu Sanyal, were helping to organize the peasants. They’d met in prison. Majumdar was a college dropout from a landowning family, a lawyer’s son. In the papers there were pictures of a frail man with a bony face, a hooked nose, bushy hair. He was an asthmatic, a Marxist-Leninist theoretician. Some of the senior Communists called him a madman. Sanyal was a disciple of Majumdar’s, a Brahman who’d learned the tribal dialects and refused to own property.</p><p>As the rebellion spread, the police started patrolling the area. Imposing undeclared curfews, making arbitrary arrests.</p><p>In May, it was reported that a group of peasants, men and women, had attacked a police inspector with bows and arrows, killing him. The next day, the local police force encountered a rioting crowd on the road. An arrow struck one of the sergeants in the arm, and the crowd was ordered to disband. When it didn’t, the police fired. Eleven people were killed, eight of them women.</p><p>At night, listening to the radio, secretly smoking after their parents had gone to bed, Subhash and Udayan talked about what was unfolding.</p><p>Do you think it was worth it? Subhash asked. What the peasants did?</p><p>Of course it was worth it. They rose up. They risked everything. People with nothing. People those in power do nothing to protect.</p><p>But will it make a difference? What good are bows and arrows against a modern state?</p><p>Udayan pressed his fingertips together, as if to clasp a few grains of rice. If you were born into that life, what would you do?</p><p>By autumn, Sanyal and Majumdar had both gone into hiding. It was the same autumn that Che Guevara was executed in Bolivia, his hands cut off to prove his death.</p><p>In India, journalists started publishing their own periodicals. <em>Liberation</em> in English, <em>Deshabrati</em> in Bengali. They reproduced articles from Chinese Communist magazines. Udayan began bringing them home.<span data-page="page_5"></span></p><p>This rhetoric is nothing new, their father said, leafing through a copy. Our generation read Marx, too.</p><p>Your generation didn’t solve anything, Udayan said.</p><p>We built a nation. We’re independent. The country is ours.</p><p>It’s not enough, Baba. Where did it get us? Who has it helped?</p><p>These things take time.</p><p>Their father dismissed Naxalbari. He said young people were getting excited over nothing. I’ve already lived through change in this country, he said. I know what it takes for one system to replace another. Not you.</p><p>But Udayan persisted. He started challenging their father the way he used to challenge their teachers at school. If he was so proud that India was independent, why hadn’t he protested the British at the time? Why had he never joined a labor union? Why had he never taken a stand?</p><p>Both Subhash and Udayan knew the answer. Because their father was a government employee, he was barred from joining any party or union. During Independence, he was forbidden to speak out; those were the terms of his job.</p><p>It was for our sake. He was being responsible, Subhash said.</p><p>But Udayan didn’t see it that way.</p><p>Now, if they happened to pass the Tolly Club together, Udayan called it an affront. People still filled slums all over the city; children were born and raised on the streets. Why were a hundred acres walled off for the enjoyment of a few?</p><p>Subhash remembered the imported trees, the jackals, the bird cries. The golf balls heavy in their pockets, the undulating green of the course. He remembered Udayan going over the wall first, challenging him to follow. Crouching on the ground the last evening they were there, trying to shield him.</p><p>But Udayan said that golf was the pastime of the comprador bourgeoisie. He said the Tolly Club was proof that India was still a semi-colonial country, behaving as if the British had never left.</p><p>He pointed out that Che, who had worked as a caddy on a golf course in Argentina, had come to the same conclusion. That after the Cuban revolution getting rid of the golf courses was one of the first things Castro had done.</p><p>Under their bed, against the wall, there was a can of red paint and a brush. Beneath their mattress Subhash found a folded piece of paper containing a list of slogans, copied out in Udayan’s hand. “China’s Chairman is our Chairman!” “Down with elections!” “Our path is the path of Naxalbari!”</p><p>The walls of the city were turning thick with them now. The walls of campus buildings, the high walls of the film studios. The lower walls flanking the lanes of their enclave.</p><p>One night, Subhash heard Udayan come into the house and go straight to the bathroom. He heard the sound of water hitting the floor. Subhash was sitting at the study table. Udayan pushed the can of paint beneath their bed.</p><p>Subhash closed his notebook, replaced the cap on his pen. What were you doing just now?</p><p>Rinsing off.</p><p>Udayan crossed the room and sat in a chair by the window. He was wearing white cotton pajamas that hung on him loosely. His skin was damp, the hair dark on his chest. He put a cigarette to his lips and slid open a matchbox. It took him a few strikes to light the match.</p><p>You were painting slogans? Subhash asked him.</p><p>The ruling class puts its propaganda everywhere. Why should they be allowed to influence people and no one else?</p><p>What happens if the police catch you?</p><p>They won’t.</p><p>He turned the radio on. If we don’t stand up to a problem, we contribute to it, he said.</p><p>After a pause he added, Come with me tomorrow, if you want.</p><p>Again Subhash was the lookout. Again alert to every sound. They’d told their parents that they were going to a late showing of a film.</p><p>He stood close. The pond frogs were calling, monotonous, insistent. He watched as Udayan dipped the paintbrush into the can.</p><p>Subhash was not afraid of being caught this time. Perhaps it was foolish of him, but something told him that such a thing could only happen once. Yet Subhash was angry with himself for going along with it. For still needing to prove he could. He was sick of the fear that always rose up in him: that he would cease to exist, and that somehow he and Udayan would cease to be brothers, were Subhash to resist him.</p><p>After their studies ended, they were among so many others in their generation who were overqualified and unemployed. They began tutoring to bring in money, contributing their earnings to the household. Udayan found a job teaching science at a technical high school close to Tollygunge. He seemed satisfied with an ordinary occupation, indifferent to the idea of building up a career.</p><p>Subhash decided to apply to a few Ph.D. programs in the United States. The immigration laws had changed, making it easier for Indian students to enter. While studying for his master’s degree at Jadavpur, he’d begun to focus his research on chemistry and the environment. The effects of petroleum and nitrogen on oceans and streams and lakes.</p><p>He suggested that Udayan should go abroad, too, where there were more jobs, where it might be easier for both of them. He mentioned the famous universities that supported<span data-page="page_6"></span> the world’s most gifted scientists: M.I.T., Princeton, where Einstein had been.</p><p>But none of this impressed Udayan. How can you walk away from what’s happening? There, of all places?</p><p>It’s a degree program. It’s only a matter of a few years.</p><p>Udayan shook his head. If you go, you won’t come back.</p><p>How do you know?</p><p>Because I know you. Because you think only of yourself.</p><p>Subhash stared at his brother. Lounging on their bed, smoking, preoccupied by the newspapers.</p><p>You don’t think what you’re doing is selfish?</p><p>Udayan turned a page of the newspaper, not bothering to look up. I don’t think wanting to make a difference is selfish, no.</p><p>This isn’t a game you’re playing. What if the police come to the house? What if you get arrested? What would Ma and Baba think?</p><p>There’s more to life than what they think.</p><p>What’s happened to you, Udayan? They’re the people who raised you. Who continue to feed and clothe you. You’d amount to nothing if it weren’t for them.</p><p>Udayan got up and strode out of the room. A moment later he was back. He stood before Subhash, his face lowered. His anger, quick to flare, had already left him.</p><p>You’re the other side of me, Subhash. It’s without you that I’m nothing. Don’t go.</p><p>It was the only time he’d admitted such a thing. He’d said it with love in his voice. With need.</p><p>But Subhash heard it as a command, one of so many he’d capitulated to all his life. Another exhortation to do as Udayan did, to follow him.</p><p>The university had begun as an agricultural school. A land-grant college still surrounded by greenhouses, orchards, fields of corn. On the outskirts were lush pastures of scientifically cultivated grass, nicer than the grass that grew inside the walls of the Tolly Club.</p><p>But Subhash was no longer in Tollygunge. He had stepped out of it as he had stepped so many mornings out of dreams, its reality and its particular logic rendered meaningless in the light of day. The difference was so extreme that he could not accommodate the two places together in his mind. In this enormous new country, there seemed to be nowhere for the old to reside. There was nothing to link them; he was the sole link. Here life ceased to obstruct or assault him. Here was a place where humanity was not always pushing, rushing, running as if with a fire at its back.</p><p>And yet certain physical aspects of Rhode Island corresponded roughly to those of Calcutta, within India. Mountains to the north, an ocean to the east. As Tollygunge, in a previous era, had been flooded by the sea, all of Rhode Island had once been covered with sheets of ice. The advance and retreat of glaciers had created marshes and the bay, dunes and moraines. They had shaped the current shore.</p><p>He found a room in a white wooden house, sharing a kitchen and bathroom with another Ph.D. student, named Richard Grifalconi. A student of sociology, he came from a Quaker family in Wisconsin. He told Subhash that he’d just turned thirty. For the sake of the next generation, he’d decided to become a professor. He’d travelled to the South as an undergraduate, to protest segregation on public transportation. He’d spent two weeks in a Mississippi jail. Gandhi was a hero to him, he said. Udayan would have scoffed, Subhash thought, saying that Gandhi had sided with enemies of the people. That he had disarmed India in the name of liberation.</p><p>The oceanography campus, where most of his classes were held, overlooked Narragansett Bay. He studied the gases that were dissolved in the sea’s solution, the isotopes found in deep sediments. The iodine found in seaweed, the carbon in plankton, the copper in the blood of crabs.</p><p>At the foot of the campus, at the base of a steep hill, there was a small beach strewn with gray-and-yellow stones where he liked to eat his lunch. On cloudy days, at intervals, the sound of a foghorn pierced the air, like the conch shells that were blown in Calcutta to ward off evil. At the top of the hill, there was a church with white shingles arranged like a honeycomb. The central portion rose to a steeple. The paint was no longer fresh, the wood beneath it absorbing so much salt from the air, so many storms that had travelled up the Rhode Island coast. It reminded him of the small mosque in Tollygunge. A place of worship designated for others, which had served as a landmark in his life.</p><p>One afternoon, he was surprised to see cars lining the road. A group of people, adults and children, stood outside the open doors of the church. A couple on the steps were smiling, ducking their heads as the group showered them with rice.</p><p>For the first time, he thought of his own marriage. He wondered what woman his parents would choose for him. He wondered when it would be. Getting married would mean returning to Calcutta. In that sense, he was in no hurry. He was proud to have come alone to America. To learn it, as he once must have learned to stand and walk and speak. He’d wanted so much to leave Calcutta, not only for the sake of<span data-page="page_7"></span> his education but also—he could admit this to himself now—to take a step that Udayan never would.</p><p>One day, walking past the quadrangle on the main campus, Subhash saw Richard at the center of a group of students and faculty, wearing a black armband. Speaking through a megaphone, Richard argued that Vietnam was a mistake, that the American government had had no right to intervene.</p><p>Some people called out or cheered, but most of them just listened and clapped, as they might at the theatre. They sprawled back on their elbows in the grass of Rhode Island, sunning their faces, listening to Richard protest a war that was being fought thousands of miles away.</p><p>It was nothing like the demonstrations that erupted now in Calcutta. Disorganized mobs representing rival Communist parties, running helter-skelter through the streets. Chanting, unrelenting. They were demonstrations that almost always turned violent.</p><p>Subhash drifted away. He didn’t support the war in Vietnam, either. But, like his father, he knew he had to be careful. He knew he could get arrested in America for denouncing the government, perhaps even for holding up a sign. He was here courtesy of a student visa, studying thanks to a fellowship. He’d been invited to America as Nixon’s guest.</p><p>Here, each day, he remembered how he’d felt those evenings he and Udayan had snuck into the Tolly Club. This time he’d been admitted officially, and yet he remained vigilant, at the threshold. He knew that the door could close just as arbitrarily as it had opened.</p><p>Most nights, Richard was out at dinnertime, but if he happened to be home he accepted Subhash’s invitation to share a meal, bringing out his ashtray and a packet of cigarettes, offering one of his beers as Subhash boiled a pot of rice.</p><p>There’s going to be a protest in Boston, Richard said one evening. The story of My Lai had just broken, and they’d been talking about the reports of a mass murder, bodies in ditches, an American lieutenant under investigation. I have friends there who can put us up for a night. Why don’t you come with me?</p><p>I don’t think so.</p><p>You’re not angry about the war?</p><p>It’s not my place to object.</p><p>He found that he could be honest with Richard. Richard listened to him. He didn’t merely try to convert him.</p><p>Richard asked Subhash about India, about its caste system, its poverty. Who was to blame?</p><p>I don’t know. These days everyone just blames everyone else.</p><p>But is there a solution? Where does the government stand?</p><p>Subhash didn’t know how to describe India’s fractious politics, its complicated society, to an American. He said it was an ancient place that was also young, still struggling to know itself. You should be talking to my brother, he said.</p><p>You have a brother?</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>You’ve never mentioned him. What’s his name?</p><p>He paused, then uttered Udayan’s name for the first time since he’d arrived in Rhode Island.</p><p>Well, what would Udayan say?</p><p>He would say that an agrarian economy based on feudalism is the problem. He would say the country needs a more egalitarian structure. Better land reforms.</p><p>Sounds like a Chinese model.</p><p>It is. He supports Naxalbari.</p><p>Naxalbari? What’s that?</p><p>A few days later, in his mailbox at his department, he found a letter from Udayan. Paragraphs in Bengali, dark-blue ink against the lighter blue of the aerogram. It had been mailed in October; it was November now.</p><p>If this reaches you destroy it. No need to compromise either of us. But given that my only chance to invade the United States is by letter, I can’t resist. I’ve just returned from another trip outside the city. I met Comrade Sanyal. I was able to sit with him, speak with him. I had to wear a blindfold. I’ll tell you about it sometime.</p><p>Why no news? No doubt the flora and fauna of the world’s greatest capitalist power captivate you. But if you can bear to tear yourself away try to make yourself useful. I hear the antiwar movement there is in full swing.</p><p>Here developments are encouraging. A Red Guard is forming, travelling to villages, propagating Mao Tse-tung’s quotations. Our generation is the vanguard; the struggle of students is part of the armed peasant struggle, Majumdar says.</p><p>You’ll come back to an altered country, a more just society, I’m confident of this. A changed home, too. Baba’s taken out a loan. They’re adding to what we already have. They seem to think it’s necessary. That we won’t get married and raise families under the same roof if the house stays the way it is.</p><p>I told them it was a waste, an extravagance, given that you don’t even live here. But they didn’t listen and now it’s too late, an architect came and the scaffolding’s gone up. They claim they’ll be finished in a year or two.</p><p>The days are dull without you. And though I refuse to forgive you for not supporting a movement that will only improve the lives of millions of people, I hope you can forgive me for giving you a hard time. Will you hurry up with whatever it is you’re doing? An embrace from your brother.</p><p>He’d<span data-page="page_8"></span> concluded with a quotation: “War will bring the revolution; revolution will stop the war.”</p><p>Subhash reread the letter several times. It was as if Udayan were there, speaking to him, teasing him. Perhaps the letter would have been safe among his possessions in Rhode Island, but the next day he took it to his lab, lingering on some pretense at the end of the session, waiting to be alone. Ceremonially he placed it on the dark stone counter, striking a match, watching the edges blacken, his brother’s words disappear.</p><p>A new decade began: 1970. In winter, when the trees stood naked, the stiff ground covered with snow, a second letter came from Udayan, in an envelope this time.</p><p>Subhash tore it open and found a small black-and-white photograph of a young woman, standing, her slender arms folded across her chest.</p><p>She was at ease, also a little skeptical. Her head turned partly to one side, her lips closed but playful, her smile slightly askew. Her hair was in a braid, draped over the front of one shoulder. Her complexion was deep.</p><p>She was compelling without being pretty. Nothing like the demure girls that his mother used to point out to Udayan and Subhash at weddings. It was a candid shot, snapped somewhere on the streets of Calcutta. He wondered if Udayan had taken the picture, if he’d inspired the playful expression on her face.</p><p>This is in lieu of a formal introduction, and it will be as formal an announcement as you will get. But it’s time that you met her. I’ve known her for a couple of years. We kept it quiet, but you know how it is. Her name is Gauri and she’s finishing a degree in philosophy at Presidency. A girl from North Calcutta, Cornwallis Street. Both her parents are dead, she lives with her brother—a friend of mine—and some relatives. She prefers books to jewels and saris. She believes as I do.</p><p>Like Chairman Mao, I reject the idea of an arranged marriage. It is one thing, I admit, that I admire about the West. And so I’ve married her. Don’t worry, apart from running off with her there’s no scandal. You’re not about to be an uncle. Not yet, anyway. Too many children are victims of our defective social structure. This needs first to be fixed.</p><p>I wish you could have been here, but you didn’t miss any type of celebration. It was a civil registration. I told Ma and Baba after the fact, as I am telling you.</p><p>They are still in shock, upset with me and also for no reason with Gauri, but we’re with them now, learning to live with one another. They can’t bear to tell you what I’ve done. So I’m telling you myself.</p><p>At the end of the letter, he asked Subhash to buy a few books for Gauri, saying that they would be easier to find in the States.</p><p>Don’t bother putting them in the mail, they’ll only get lost or stolen. Bring them with you. You will show up to congratulate me one of these days, won’t you?</p><p>This time he didn’t reread the letter. Once was enough.</p><p>Not only had Udayan married before Subhash but he’d married a woman of his choosing. On his own he’d taken a step that Subhash believed was their parents’ place to decide. Here was another example of Udayan forging ahead of Subhash, of denying that he’d come second.</p><p>The back of the photograph was dated in Udayan’s handwriting. It was from more than a year ago, 1968. Udayan had got to know her and fallen in love with her while Subhash was still in Calcutta. All that time, Udayan had kept Gauri to himself.</p><p>Once more Subhash destroyed the letter. The photograph he kept, at the back of one of his textbooks, as proof of what Udayan had done.</p><p>From time to time he drew out the picture and looked at it. He wondered when he would meet Gauri and what he would think of her, now that they were connected. And part of him felt defeated by Udayan all over again, for having found a girl like that.</p><p>In the spring semester of his second year, for three weeks, Subhash boarded a research vessel with a group of students and professors. As the ship pulled away, the water cleaved a foaming trail that vanished even as it was being formed. The shoreline receded, resting calmly like a thin brown snake upon the water. He saw the earth’s mass shrinking, turning faint.</p><p>Under the sun’s glare, as the ship picked up speed, he felt the wind’s motion on his face, the wild turbulence of the atmosphere. He watched the life that circled the ship, gannets with creamy heads and black-and-white wings, dolphins that leaped in pairs. Humpback whales spouted mists as they breathed, playfully breaching in the water, sometimes swimming beneath the ship without disturbing it, emerging on the other side.</p><p>Sailing even slightly east reminded Subhash of how far away he was from his family. He thought of the time it took to cross even a tiny portion of the earth’s surface.</p><p>Isolated on the ship with the scientists and other students and crew, he felt doubly alone. Unable to fathom his future,<span data-page="page_9"></span> severed from his past. In Tollygunge his family did not have a phone line. He was learning to live without hearing their voices, to receive news of them only in writing.</p><p>Udayan’s letters no longer referred to Naxalbari or ended with slogans. He didn’t explain why this was so. Instead he wrote about football scores, or about this or that in the neighborhood—a certain store closing down, a family they’d known moving away. The latest film by Mrinal Sen.</p><p>Subhash saved a few of these letters, since it no longer seemed necessary to throw them away. But their blandness puzzled him. Though the handwriting was the same, it was almost as if they’d been written by a different person.</p><p>Letters from his parents referred only obliquely to Gauri, and only as an example of what not to do.</p><p>We hope, when the time comes, you will trust us to settle your future, to choose your wife and to be present at your wedding. We hope you will not disregard our wishes, as your brother did.</p><p>He replied, reassuring his father and mother that his marriage was up to them to arrange. He sent a portion of his stipend to help pay for the work on the house, and wrote that he was eager to see them. And yet, day after day, cut off from them, he ignored them.</p><p>He began his third autumn in Rhode Island. Once more the leaves of the trees lost their chlorophyll, replaced by the shades he had left behind: vivid hues of cayenne and turmeric and ginger pounded fresh every morning in the kitchen, to season the food his mother prepared. The colors intensified until the leaves began to dwindle, foliage clustered here and there among the branches, like butterflies feeding at the same source, before falling to the ground.</p><p>He thought of Durga Puja coming again to Calcutta. The past two years, he’d received a battered parcel from his parents, containing gifts for him. Kurtas too thin to wear most of the time in Rhode Island, bars of sandalwood soap, Darjeeling tea.</p><p>He thought of the Mahalaya playing on All India Radio, coming through the shortwave. Throughout Tollygunge, across Calcutta and the whole of West Bengal, people were waking up in darkness to listen to the oratorio as light crept into the sky, invoking Durga as she descended to earth with her four children. Every year at this time, Hindu Bengalis believed, she came to stay with her father, Himalaya. For the days of Puja, she relinquished her husband, Shiva, before returning once more to married life.</p><p>This year no parcel came from his family. Only a telegram. The message consisted of two sentences, lifeless, drifting at the top of a sea.</p><p><em>Udayan killed. Come back if you can.</em></p><p>He left behind the brief winter days, the obscure place where he’d grieved alone. He took a bus to Boston and boarded a night flight to Europe. The second flight involved a layover in the Middle East. At last he landed in Delhi. From there he boarded an overnight train to Howrah Station.</p><p>As he travelled halfway across India, from companions on the train he heard about what had been taking place in Calcutta while he’d been away. Information that neither Udayan nor his parents had mentioned in letters. Events Subhash had not come across in any newspaper in Rhode Island.</p><p>By 1970, people told him, things had taken a turn. By then the Naxalites were operating underground. Members surfaced only to carry out dramatic attacks. They ransacked schools and colleges across the city. In the middle of the night, they burned records and defaced portraits, raising red flags. They plastered Calcutta with images of Mao. They intimidated voters, hoping to disrupt the elections. They fired pipe guns on the city’s streets. They hid bombs in public places, so that people were afraid to sit in a cinema or stand in line at a bank.</p><p>Then the targets turned specific: unarmed traffic constables at busy intersections, wealthy businessmen, certain educators, members of the rival party, the C.P.I.(M.). The killings were sadistic, gruesome, intended to shock. The wife of the French consul was murdered in her sleep. They assassinated Gopal Sen, the vice-chancellor of Jadavpur University, while he was taking his evening walk. It was the day before he’d planned to retire. They bludgeoned him with steel bars, and stabbed him four times.</p><p>They took control of certain neighborhoods, calling them Red Zones. They took control of Tollygunge. They set up makeshift hospitals, safe houses.</p><p>But then new legislation was passed, an old law was renewed. Laws that authorized the police and the paramilitary to enter homes without a warrant, to arrest young men without charges. The old law had been created by the British, to counter Independence, to cut off its legs.</p><p>After that, the police started to cordon off and search the neighborhoods of the city. Sealing exits, knocking on doors, interrogating Calcutta’s young men. The police had killed Udayan. This much Subhash was able to surmise.</p><p>Only two people had come to receive him in the early morning at Howrah Station. A younger cousin of his father’s, Biren Kaka, and his wife. They were standing by a fruit vender, unable to smile when they spotted him. He understood this diminished welcome, but he<span data-page="page_10"></span> could not understand why, after he’d travelled for more than two days, after he’d been away for more than two years, his parents were unwilling to come even this far to acknowledge his return. When he left India, his mother had promised a hero’s welcome, a garland of flowers draped around his neck.</p><p>The streets were as he remembered. Crowded with cycle rickshaws in the early-morning light, the squawking of their horns sounding to his ears like a flock of agitated geese.</p><p>The walls of the film studios and the Tolly Club were covered in slogans. “Make 1970s the decade of liberation.” “Rifles bring freedom, and freedom is coming.”</p><p>As they turned beside the small mosque, Subhash felt his prolonged journey ending too soon. He was assaulted by the sour, septic smell of his neighborhood, of his childhood. The smell of standing water. The stink of algae, of open drains.</p><p>As they approached the two ponds, he saw that the small home he’d left behind had been replaced by something impressive, ungainly. Long terraces, like airy corridors, ran from front to back along the new upper portion of the house. They were enclosed by grilles forged in a trefoil pattern. The emerald paint was glossy. Through one of the grilles he saw his parents, sitting on the top floor. He strained to see their expressions but could make out nothing.</p><p>He pressed the buzzer that Udayan had installed. It still worked.</p><p>His parents did not stand or say his name. They did not come downstairs to greet him. Instead, his father lowered a key on a string through the ironwork. Subhash opened a heavy padlock at the side of the house. Finally, he heard his father clearing his throat, seeming to loosen the secretions of a long silence.</p><p>Lock the gate behind you, he instructed Subhash, before retracting the key.</p><p>Subhash climbed a staircase with smooth black bannisters, sky-blue walls. Biren Kaka and his wife followed behind. When he saw his parents, standing together on the terrace, he bent over to touch their feet. He was an only son.</p><p>In spite of the picture that hung in his parents’ new room, which they took him to see, he could not believe that Udayan was nowhere. But here was the proof. The photo had been taken nearly ten years earlier by a relative who owned a camera. It was the day he and Udayan had got the results of their higher secondary exams, the day his father said had been the proudest of his life. They had posed side by side in the courtyard. Subhash saw an inch of his own shoulder, pressed up beside Udayan’s. The rest of him, in order to make the death portrait, had been cut away.</p><p>He stood before the image and wept, his head cradled in his arm, in an awkward embrace of himself. But his parents, beyond the shock of it, observed him as they might an actor on a stage, waiting for the scene to end.</p><p>From the terrace he had an open view of the neighborhood. Lower rooftops of tin or tile with squash vines trailing over them. The tops of walls, dotted white, splattered with excrement from crows. The two oblong ponds on the other side of the lane. The lowland, looking to him like a mudflat at low tide.</p><p>He’d been told to eat his lunch upstairs. That was where the kitchen was now. On the floor of his parents’ bedroom, plates had been set out for his father, for Biren Kaka and his wife, for Subhash. His mother would eat after serving them, as she always did.</p><p>He sat with his back to the portrait. He could not bear to look at it again.</p><p>He was ravenous for the simple meal: dal and slices of fried bitter melon, rice and fish stew. Sweet pabda fish from the river, their cooked eyes like yellow pebbles.</p><p>Drinking water was poured from a black clay urn in the corner of the room. The cup heavy in his hand, the rim slightly too wide for his mouth.</p><p>Where is she? he asked.</p><p>Who?</p><p>Gauri.</p><p>His mother ladled the dal onto his rice. She takes her meals in the kitchen, she said.</p><p>Why?</p><p>She prefers it.</p><p>He didn’t believe her. He didn’t say what came to his mind. That Udayan would have hated them for segregating her, for observing such customs.</p><p>Is she there now? I would like to meet her.</p><p>She’s resting. She’s not feeling well today.</p><p>Have you called a doctor?</p><p>His mother looked down, preoccupied with the food she was serving.</p><p>There’s no need for that.</p><p>Is it serious?</p><p>Finally, she explained herself.</p><p>She is expecting a child, she said.</p><p>After lunch, he went out, walking past the two ponds. There were scattered clumps of water hyacinth, and still enough water to form puddles here and there.</p><p>He noticed a small stone marker. On it was Udayan’s name. Beneath that, the years of his birth and death: 1945-1971.</p><p>It was a memorial tablet, erected for political martyrs. Here where the water came and went, where it collected and vanished, was where his brother’s Party comrades had chosen to put it.</p><p>He returned to the house, intending to rest briefly, but fell into a deep sleep. When he woke up it was late, past the hour his parents normally<span data-page="page_11"></span> ate dinner. He’d slept through the meal. The fan wasn’t moving; the current had gone. He found a flashlight under the mattress, switched it on. Going upstairs to see if there was anything left to eat in the kitchen, he saw Gauri sitting on the floor, with a candle lit beside her.</p><p>He recognized her at once, from the snapshot Udayan had sent. But she was no longer the relaxed college girl who had smiled for his brother. That picture of her had been in black-and-white, but the absence of color now, even in the warm light of the candle, was more profound.</p><p>Her long hair was pulled back above her neck. She sat with her head down, her wrists bare, dressed in a sari of crisp white. She was thin, with no visible trace of the life she was carrying. She wore glasses, a detail withheld from the photograph. When she looked up at him, he saw in spite of the glasses another thing the photo had not fully conveyed. The frank beauty of her eyes.</p><p>He took her in but did not speak to her, watching her eat some dal and rice. She was dragging a few grains of salt with her index finger from the little pile at the edge of her plate and mixing it into her food. He saw that the fish he had been served at lunch had not been given to her.</p><p>I am Subhash, he said.</p><p>I know.</p><p>I don’t mean to disturb you.</p><p>They tried to wake you for dinner.</p><p>I’m wide awake now.</p><p>She started to get up. Let me fix a plate for you.</p><p>Finish your meal. I can get it myself.</p><p>He felt her eyes on him as he scanned the shelves with his flashlight, retrieved a dish, uncovered the pots and pans that had been left for him.</p><p>You sound just like him, she said.</p><p>He sat down beside her, the candle between them, facing her but not looking at her. He saw her hand resting over her plate, the tips of her fingers coated with food.</p><p>Is it because of my parents that you’re not eating fish?</p><p>She ignored his question. You have the same voice, she said.</p><p>Belatedly, he was presented with his gifts for Durga Puja. There was gray material for trousers, striped material for shirts. Two sets of each, for he was also given Udayan’s share. More than once, offering him a biscuit, asking if he needed more tea, his mother called him Udayan instead of Subhash. And more than once he answered, not correcting her.</p><p>His parents asked no questions about America. Inches away, they avoided looking Subhash in the eye. He wondered whether his parents would ask him to remain in Calcutta, to abandon his life in Rhode Island. But there was no mention of this. Nor was there mention of the possibility of their arranging a marriage for him. They were in no position to plan a wedding, to think about his future.</p><p>In the early evening, always at the same time, his mother gathered a few flowers from the pots in the courtyard and left the house. From the terrace, he saw her walking past the ponds.</p><p>She stopped at the marker by the edge of the lowland, rinsing the stone clean with water she drew from a small brass urn, the one she had used to bathe him and Udayan when they were small, and then she placed the flowers on top. Without asking, he knew that this was the hour; that this had been the time of day.</p><p>On the radio, they listened to the news of East Pakistan turning into Bangladesh after thirteen days of war. For Muslim Bengalis it meant liberation, but for Calcutta the conflict had meant another surge of refugees from across the border.</p><p>Though the police raids had ended, his father still kept the key to the padlocked house under his pillow when he slept.</p><p>They did not talk of Udayan. For days his name did not escape their lips.</p><p>Then one evening Subhash asked, How did it happen?</p><p>His father’s face was impassive, as if he hadn’t heard.</p><p>I thought he’d quit the Party, Subhash pressed. That he’d drifted away from it. Had he?</p><p>I was at home, his father said, not acknowledging the question.</p><p>When were you at home?</p><p>That day. I opened the gate for them. I let them in.</p><p>Who?</p><p>The police.</p><p>Finally, he was getting somewhere. At the same time, Subhash felt worse now that his suspicion had been confirmed.</p><p>Why didn’t you tell me he was in danger?</p><p>It would not have made a difference.</p><p>Well, tell me now. Why did they kill him?</p><p>His mother reacted then, glaring at Subhash. She had a small face, with just enough space for what it contained. She was still youthful, her dark hair decorated with its bright column of vermillion to signify that she had a husband.</p><p>He was your brother, she said. How can you ask such a thing?</p><p>The next morning, he sought Gauri out, knocking on the door of her room. Her hair had just been washed. She was wearing it loose to let it dry.</p><p>In his hand was a paperback book he’d bought for her at Udayan’s request. “One-Dimensional Man,” by Herbert Marcuse. He gave it<span data-page="page_12"></span> to her.</p><p>This is for you. From Udayan. He’d asked me.</p><p>You are kind to bring it, she said.</p><p>It was no trouble.</p><p>He wanted to talk to her. But there was nowhere in the house where they might have a conversation alone.</p><p>Shall we go for a walk?</p><p>Not now.</p><p>She stepped to one side and pointed to a chair.</p><p>He hesitated, then entered. It was dim, until Gauri pushed open the shutters of the two windows, admitting a stark white glow. A square of sunlight fell onto the bed, a calm bright patch containing the vertical shadows of the window bars.</p><p>The bed was low to the floor, with slender posts. There was also a short armoire and a small dressing table with a bench. Instead of powders and combs, there were notebooks, fountain pens, bottles of ink. The room smelled sharply of teak, emanating from the furniture. He could smell the fragrance of her freshly washed hair.</p><p>The light is nice, he said.</p><p>Only now. In a few minutes, the sun will be too high and the angle will be lost.</p><p>She perched on the edge of the bed. He saw other books spread open, face down, covered in smooth brown paper, on which she had written the titles. He watched as she retrieved an old section of newspaper and began to wrap the cover of the book he’d given her. He and Udayan used to do this together, after buying their new schoolbooks for the year.</p><p>No one does that over there.</p><p>Why not?</p><p>I don’t know. Maybe the covers are more durable. Or maybe they don’t mind them looking old.</p><p>He asked Gauri about her studies, and she told him she’d completed her bachelor’s in philosophy earlier in the year. It had taken longer than it should have. It had been difficult, because of the unrest. She said that she’d been considering a master’s program, before Udayan was killed. Before she learned she was pregnant.</p><p>Did Udayan know he was going to be a father?</p><p>No.</p><p>Her waist was still small. But Udayan’s ghost was palpable within her, preserved in this room where she spent all her time. When she spoke of him it was an evocation of him. She had not shut down as his parents had.</p><p>When will the baby be born?</p><p>In summer.</p><p>How is it for you here in the house? With my parents?</p><p>She said nothing. He waited, then realized he was staring at her, distracted by a small dark mole on the side of her neck. He looked away.</p><p>I can take you somewhere else, he suggested. Would you like to visit your family for a while? Your aunts and uncles?</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>Why not?</p><p>For the first time, a smile nearly came to her face, the uneven smile he remembered from the photograph, slightly favoring one side of her mouth. Because I ran off and married your brother, she said.</p><p>Even now they don’t want to see you?</p><p>She shrugged. They’re nervous. I don’t blame them. I might compromise their safety, even your parents’ safety, who knows?</p><p>But surely there’s someone?</p><p>My brother came to see me after it happened. He and Udayan were friends. But it’s not up to him.</p><p>Can you tell me something else?</p><p>What do you want to know?</p><p>I want to know what happened to my brother, he said.</p><p>It was the week before Durga Puja. The month of Ashvin, the first phase of the waxing moon.</p><p>At the tram depot, Gauri and her mother-in-law hired a cycle rickshaw to take them home. They settled themselves on the bench of the rickshaw, packets and bags on their laps and heaped at their feet. They were returning from a day of shopping, a little later than they’d intended.</p><p>The packets contained gifts for extended family, also for themselves. New saris. New sheets to sleep on, new slippers. Towels to dry their bodies, combs to untangle their hair.</p><p>As they approached the mosque at the corner, her mother-in-law told the driver to slow down and turn left. But the driver stopped pedalling, telling them that he was unwilling to travel off the main road, so they finished the journey on foot, carrying the things they’d bought.</p><p>The lane hooked to the right, past the pandal in their enclave, the deities adorned but unattended. No families were walking about. Soon the two ponds across from the house came into view.</p><p>On the bank of the first pond, Gauri saw a van belonging to the Central Reserve Police. Policemen and soldiers stood here and there, in their olive uniforms and helmets. Not many, but enough of them to form a loose constellation wherever she looked.</p><p>No one stopped them from walking through the swinging wooden doors into the courtyard. They saw that the iron gate at the side of the house was open. The key was dangling in the padlock, opened in haste.</p><p>They removed their street slippers and set down their bags. They began to climb the first set of steps. Halfway up, Gauri saw her father-in-law descending, his hands raised over his head.</p><p>An officer followed him. He was pointing a rifle at his back. Gauri and her mother-in-law were instructed to turn around, to walk back downstairs. There was no opportunity to go farther into the house, to see<span data-page="page_13"></span> the rooms that had been overturned. Clothes knocked off the drying lines strung along the terrace, wardrobe doors flung open. Pillows and quilts pulled off the beds, coals dumped from the coal basket, lentils and grains tossed out of the Glaxo tins in the kitchen. As if they were looking for a scrap of paper and not a man.</p><p>The three of them—her father-in-law, her mother-in-law, and Gauri—were ordered to exit the house, walk through the courtyard and back onto the street. They were told to proceed in single file, past the two ponds, toward the lowland. The rains had been heavy, and it had flooded again. Water hyacinth shrouded the surface like a moth-eaten cloak. Gauri felt people in the surrounding homes taking in what was happening. Watching through chinks in their shutters, standing still in darkened rooms.</p><p>They were arranged in a row, their shoulders touching. The gun was still trained on her father-in-law.</p><p>She heard a conch shell blowing, the ringing of a bell. The sounds carried in from another neighborhood. Somewhere, in some house or temple, someone was praying, giving offerings at the end of another day.</p><p>We are under orders to locate and arrest Udayan Mitra, the soldier who seemed to be commanding the others said. He announced this through a megaphone. If anyone in this locality knows where he is hiding, if anyone is harboring him, you are required to step forward.</p><p>No one said anything.</p><p>My son is in America, her mother-in-law said quietly. A lie that was also the truth.</p><p>The officer ignored her. He stepped over to Gauri. His eyes were a lighter brown than his skin. He studied her, pointing his gun at her, moving it closer until she was no longer able to see it. She felt the tip, a cold pendant at the base of her throat.</p><p>You are the wife of this family? The wife of Udayan Mitra?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Where is your husband?</p><p>She had no voice. She was unable to speak.</p><p>We know he is here. We have had him followed. We have searched the house. We have blocked off the means of egress. He is wasting our time.</p><p>Gauri was aware of a painful current travelling up and down the backs of her legs.</p><p>Where is he? the officer repeated, pressing the gun against her throat a little harder.</p><p>I don’t know, she managed to say.</p><p>I think you are lying. I think you must know where he is.</p><p>Behind the water hyacinth, in the floodwater of the lowland: this was where, if the neighborhood was raided, Udayan had told her he would hide. He said there was a section where the growth was particularly dense. He kept a kerosene tin behind the house, to help him over the back wall. He’d practiced it, late at night, a few times.</p><p>We think he might be hiding in the water, the soldier continued, not removing his eyes from her.</p><p>No, she said to herself. She heard the word in her head. But then she realized that her mouth was open, like an idiot’s. Had she said something? Whispered it?</p><p>What did you say?</p><p>I said nothing.</p><p>The tip of the gun was still steady at her throat. But suddenly it was removed, the officer tipping his head toward the lowland, stepping away.</p><p>He’s there, he told the others.</p><p>Again the officer began speaking through a megaphone.</p><p>Udayan Mitra, step forward, surrender yourself, he said, the words at once distorted and piercing, audible throughout the enclave. If you hesitate, we are prepared to eliminate the members of your family.</p><p>At first, nothing happened. Some of the soldiers were wading into the water, aiming rifles. One of them fired a shot. Then, from somewhere in the lowland, she heard the sound of the water’s surface breaking.</p><p>Udayan appeared. Amid the hyacinth, in water up to his waist. Bent over, coughing, gasping for air. His hair was sticking to his scalp, his shirt sticking to his skin. His beard and mustache needed trimming. He raised his arms over his head.</p><p>Good. Walk toward us now.</p><p>He stepped through the weeds, out of the water, until he stood only a few feet away. He was shivering, struggling to regulate his breathing. She saw the lips that never fully met, leaving a small diamond-shaped gap at the center. She saw flecks of algae coating his neck, his forearms.</p><p>He was told to bend down and touch his parents’ feet. He was told to ask for their forgiveness. He stood before his mother and bent down. Forgive me, he said.</p><p>What are we to forgive? her father-in-law asked, his voice cracking, when Udayan bent before him. He appealed to the officers. You are making a mistake.</p><p>Your son has betrayed his country. It is he who has made a mistake.</p><p>His hands were bound by a rope. She saw him wince as it was tightened.</p><p>This way, the officer said, pointing with his gun.</p><p>Udayan paused, and glanced at her. He looked at her face as he always did, absorbing its details as if for the first time.</p><p>They pushed him into the van and slammed the door shut. Gauri and her in-laws were ordered back into the house. One of the soldiers escorted them. She wondered which prison they would take him to. What they would do<span data-page="page_14"></span> to him there.</p><p>They heard the van starting. But instead of reversing and heading out of the enclave, toward the main road, it travelled over the damp grass that edged the lowland, the tires leaving thick tracks. Over toward the empty field that was on the other side of it.</p><p>Inside the house they climbed to the third floor, to the terrace. They could make out the van, which had stopped now, and then Udayan standing next to it. It would have been impossible for anyone else in their neighborhood to witness what was happening. But the top floor of the house, recently completed, afforded them this view.</p><p>They saw one of the soldiers undoing the rope around Udayan’s wrists. They saw Udayan walking across the field, away from the paramilitary. He was walking toward the lowland, back toward the house, his arms raised over his head.</p><p>Gauri remembered all the times she’d watched him from her grandparents’ balcony in North Calcutta, crossing the busy street, coming to visit her.</p><p>For a moment, it was as if they were letting him go. But then a gun was fired, the bullet aimed at his back. The sound of the shot was brief, unambiguous. There was a second shot, then a third.</p><p>She watched his arms flapping, his body leaping forward, seizing up before falling to the ground. There was the clean sound of the shots, followed by the sound of crows, coarsely calling, scattering.</p><p>In their bedroom, under the mattress, forgotten among folded sections of newspaper they’d not bothered to toss, was a diary the police had discovered while Gauri and her mother-in-law were out shopping. It contained all the proof they needed. Among the equations and notes on routine formulas and experiments was a page of instructions for how to put together a Molotov cocktail, a homemade bomb. Notes on the difference in effect between methanol and gasoline. Potassium chlorate versus nitric acid. Storm matches versus a kerosene wick.</p><p>In the diary there was also a map Udayan had sketched of the layout of the Tolly Club. The locations and names of the buildings, the stables, the caretaker’s cottage. The arrangement of the driveway, the configuration of the walking paths.</p><p>Certain times of day had been jotted down, a schedule of when the guards moved around, when employees went on and off duty. Various places where a person might enter and exit the premises, targets where one might throw an explosive or leave a timed device behind.</p><p>The day after speaking to Gauri, Subhash went out, alone, into the city for the first time. He took the material his parents had given him, his share and Udayan’s, to a tailoring shop. He didn’t need new shirts and trousers, and yet he felt obligated, not wanting the material to go to waste. The news that American clothing was all ready-made had come to his parents as a surprise. It was the first detail of his life there they’d openly reacted to.</p><p>He got on a bus after he left the tailor’s, riding with no destination in mind, getting out close to Esplanade. He saw foreigners on the streets, Europeans wearing kurtas, beads. Exploring Calcutta, passing through. Though he looked like any other Bengali, he felt an allegiance with the foreigners now. He shared with them a knowledge of elsewhere. Another life to go back to. The ability to leave.</p><p>He stopped to light a cigarette, Wills, the brand Udayan had smoked. Feeling tired, he stood in front of a store that sold embroidered shawls.</p><p>What would you like to see? the owner asked. He was from Kashmir, his face pale, his eyes light, a cotton cap on his head.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Come have a look. Have a cup of tea.</p><p>He had forgotten about such gestures of hospitality. He entered and sat on a stool, watching as the woollen shawls were spread out on a large white cushion on the floor. The generosity of the effort, the faith implicit in it, touched him. He decided to buy one for his mother, realizing only now that he’d brought her nothing from America.</p><p>I’ll take this, he said, fingering a navy-blue shawl, thinking she would appreciate the softness of the wool, the intricacy of the stitch.</p><p>What else?</p><p>That’s all, he said, but then he pictured Gauri. He recalled her profile as she’d told him about Udayan. The way she’d stared straight ahead at nothing as she told him what he’d wanted to know.</p><p>He sifted through the choices at his feet. Ivory, gray, a brown that was lighter than the tea he’d been given to drink. These were considered appropriate for her now. But a vivid turquoise one with a border of minute embroidery caught his eye.</p><p>He imagined it wrapped around her shoulders, trailing over one side. Brightening her face.</p><p>Also this one, he said.</p><p>His parents were on their terrace, waiting. They asked what had taken him so long. They said it still wasn’t safe to wander so late on the streets.</p><p>Though their concern was reasonable, it annoyed him. I’m not Udayan, he was tempted to say. I would never have put you through that.</p><p>He gave his mother the shawl he’d bought for her. Then he showed her the one for Gauri.</p><p>I’d like to give her this.</p><p>You should<span data-page="page_15"></span> know better, she said. Stop trying to befriend her.</p><p>He was silent.</p><p>I heard the two of you talking yesterday.</p><p>I’m not supposed to talk to her?</p><p>What did she tell you?</p><p>He didn’t say. Instead, he asked, Why don’t you ever talk to her?</p><p>Now it was his mother who was silent.</p><p>You’ve taken away her colored clothes, the fish and meat from her plate.</p><p>These are our customs, his mother said.</p><p>It’s demeaning. Udayan would never have wanted her to live this way.</p><p>He was not used to quarrelling with his mother. But a new energy flowed through him, and he could not restrain himself.</p><p>Does it mean nothing that she’s going to give you a grandchild?</p><p>It means everything. It’s the only thing left to us, his mother said.</p><p>And what about Gauri?</p><p>She has a place here if she chooses.</p><p>What do you mean, if she chooses?</p><p>She could go somewhere to continue her studies. She might prefer it.</p><p>What makes you think that?</p><p>She’s too withdrawn, too aloof to be a mother.</p><p>His temples were throbbing. Have you discussed any of this with her?</p><p>There’s no point in worrying her about it now.</p><p>You can’t separate them. For Udayan’s sake, accept her.</p><p>His mother lost her patience. She was angry with him, too. Shut your mouth, she said. Don’t tell me how to honor my own son.</p><p>That night, under the mosquito netting, Subhash was unable to sleep.</p><p>Udayan had given his life to a movement that had been misguided, that had caused only damage, that had already been dismantled. The only thing he’d altered was what their family had been.</p><p>He had kept Subhash, and probably to a great degree his parents, deliberately in the dark. The deeper his involvement had become, the more evasive he’d turned. Writing letters as if the movement no longer mattered to him. Hoping to throw Subhash off the trail as he put together bombs, as he sketched maps of the Tolly Club.</p><p>Gauri was the one he’d trusted. He’d inserted her into their lives, only to strand her there. Subhash thought of her remaining with his parents, living by their rules. His mother’s coldness toward her was insulting, but his father’s passivity was just as cruel.</p><p>And it wasn’t simply cruelty. Their treatment of Gauri was deliberate, intended to drive her out. He thought of her becoming a mother, only to lose control of the child. He thought of the child being raised in a joyless house.</p><p>The only way to prevent it was to take Gauri away. It was all he could do to help her, the only alternative he could provide. And the only way to take her away was to marry her. To take his brother’s place, to raise his child, to come to love her as Udayan had. To follow him in a way that felt perverse, that felt ordained. That felt at once right and wrong.</p><p>He mentioned nothing to his parents, knowing that the solution he’d arrived at would appall them. He went to her directly.</p><p>This is for you, he said, standing in her doorway, giving her the shawl.</p><p>She lifted the cover of the box and looked at it.</p><p>I’d like for you to wear it, he said.</p><p>He watched her step into the room and open her wardrobe. She placed the shawl, still folded in the box, inside.</p><p>When she turned to face him again, he observed that a mosquito had landed at the very edge of her forehead, close to the hairline. He wanted to reach over and brush it away, but she stood, unflinching, perhaps unaware.</p><p>I hate how my parents treat you, he said.</p><p>She was silent. She sat down at the desk, in front of the book and the notebook spread there. She was waiting for him to go.</p><p>He lost his nerve. The idea was ridiculous. She would not wear the turquoise shawl, she would never agree to marry him and go to Rhode Island. She was mourning for Udayan, carrying his child. Subhash knew he was nothing to her.</p><p>The following afternoon, at a time when no one was expected, the buzzer rang. Subhash was sitting on the balcony, reading the papers. His father was at work, his mother had gone out on an errand. Gauri was in her room.</p><p>Downstairs, he found three men standing on the other side of the gate. Two policemen carrying guns and an investigator from the Intelligence Bureau. The investigator introduced himself. He wanted to speak to Gauri.</p><p>She’s sleeping.</p><p>Go wake her.</p><p>He unlocked the gate and took them to the second floor. He asked them to wait on the landing.</p><p>When Gauri opened her door, she was not wearing her glasses. Her hair was dishevelled, the material of her sari wrinkled. The bed was unmade.</p><p>He told her who had come. I’ll stay with you, he said.</p><p>She tied back her hair and put on her glasses. She made the bed and told him she was ready. She was composed, betraying none of the nervousness he felt.</p><p>The investigator stepped into the room first. The policemen followed, standing in the doorway. They were smoking cigarettes, allowing the ashes to fall onto the floor.</p><p>The investigator was observing the walls, the ceiling, taking in certain details. He picked up one of the books<span data-page="page_final"></span> on Gauri’s desk, thumbing through a few pages. He took a notepad and pen out of his shirt pocket.</p><p>You’re the brother? he asked, not bothering to look up at Subhash.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>The one in America?</p><p>He nodded, but the investigator was already focussed on Gauri.</p><p>You met your husband in what year?</p><p>Nineteen-sixty-eight.</p><p>While you were a student at Presidency?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>You were sympathetic to his beliefs?</p><p>In the beginning.</p><p>Are you currently a member of any political organization?</p><p>No.</p><p>I’d like to go over some photographs. They’re of some people your husband knew.</p><p>All right.</p><p>He took an envelope out of his pocket. He began handing her pictures. Small snapshots Subhash was unable to see.</p><p>Do you recognize any of these people?</p><p>No.</p><p>You’ve never met them? Your husband never introduced you to them?</p><p>No.</p><p>Subhash swallowed, and glanced at her. She was lying, he was sure.</p><p>Look carefully, please.</p><p>I have.</p><p>The investigator put the snapshots back into the envelope, careful not to smudge them. We’ll return if we have further questions, he said.</p><p>When do you go back to America? the investigator asked Subhash.</p><p>In a few weeks.</p><p>You’re nothing like your brother, he remarked, then turned to go.</p><p>Gauri was waiting for him on the terrace, sitting on one of the folding chairs.</p><p>You’re all right? he asked.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>How long before they come back?</p><p>They won’t come again.</p><p>How can you be sure?</p><p>She raised her head, then her eyes. Because I have nothing else to tell them, she said, her expression neutral, composed. He wanted to believe her.</p><p>You’re not safe here, he said. Even if the police leave you alone, my parents won’t.</p><p>What do you mean?</p><p>They want you out of this house, Gauri. They don’t want to take care of you. They want their grandchild to themselves.</p><p>Then he said the only things he could think of, the most obvious of facts: That in America no one knew about the movement, no one would bother her. She could go on with her studies. It would be an opportunity to begin again.</p><p>Because she said nothing to interrupt him, he went on, explaining that the child needed a father. In America it could be raised without the burden of what had happened. He told her he knew she still loved Udayan. He told her not to think about what people might say. If she went with him to America, it would all cease to matter.</p><p>You don’t have to do this, Gauri said to Subhash the following morning.</p><p>It’s not only for you.</p><p>He wouldn’t have wanted this.</p><p>I understand.</p><p>I’m not talking about our getting married.</p><p>What, then?</p><p>He told me we needed to wait. That it wasn’t right to begin a family. After the revolution was successful, he said, that was when we should bring a new generation into the world. And yet—</p><p>She stopped herself.</p><p>What?</p><p>He once told me, because he got married before you, that he wanted you to be the first to have a child. ♦</p>	Jhumpa Lahiri	June 10 & 17, 2013 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/06/10/brotherly-love-2	America	Books	Brothers	Calcutta, India	Communists	Country clubs	Subhash	Third	Immigrants
Checking Out	<p>In <span data-page="page_1"></span>London, night came too soon. It hung in the morning air like a threat and then in the afternoon a blue-gray dusk descended, and the Victorian buildings all wore a mournful face. In those first weeks, the weightless menace of the cold startled Obinze, drying his nostrils, deepening his anxieties, making him urinate too often. He would walk fast, his hands swallowed up by the sleeves of the gray wool coat his cousin had lent him. Sometimes he would stop outside a tube station, often by a flower or a newspaper vender, and watch the people brushing past. They walked so quickly, as if they had an important destination, a purpose to their lives. His eyes would follow them, with a lost longing, and he would think, You can work, you are legal, you are visible, and you don’t even know how fortunate you are.</p><p>It was at a tube station that he met the Angolans who would arrange his marriage, exactly two years and three days after he had arrived in England; he kept count.</p><p>“We’ll talk in the car,” one of them had said over the phone. Their old black Mercedes was fussily maintained, the floor mats wavy from vacuuming, the leather seats shiny with polish. The two Angolans looked alike, with thick eyebrows that almost touched, and they were dressed alike, too, in leather jackets and long gold chains. Their tabletop hair, which sat on their heads like tall hats, surprised him, but perhaps having retro haircuts was part of their hip image. They spoke to him with the authority of people who had done this before, and also with a slight condescension; his fate, after all, was in their hands.</p><p>“We decided on Newcastle because we know people there and London is too hot right now—too many marriages happening in London, yeah?—so we don’t want trouble,” one of them said. “Everything is going to work out. Just make sure you keep a low profile, yeah? Don’t attract any attention to yourself until the marriage is done. Don’t fight in the pub, yeah?”</p><p>“I’ve never been a very good fighter,” Obinze said dryly, but the Angolans did not smile.</p><p>“You have the money?” the other one asked.</p><p>Obinze handed over two hundred pounds, all in twenty-pound notes that he had taken out of the cash machine over two days. It was a deposit, to prove that he was serious. Later, after he met the girl, he would pay two thousand pounds.</p><p>“The rest has to be up front, yeah? We’ll use some of it to do the running around and the rest goes to the girl. Man, you know we’re not making anything from this. We usually ask for much more, but we’re doing this for your cousin,” the first one said.</p><p>Obinze did not believe them, even then. He met the girl, Cleotilde, a few days later, at a shopping center, in a McDonald’s whose windows looked out onto the dank entrance of a tube station across the street. He sat at a table with the Angolans and watched people hurry past, wondering if one of them was she, while the Angolans whispered into their phones; perhaps they were arranging other marriages.</p><p>“Hello there!” she said.</p><p>She surprised him. He had expected someone with pockmarks smothered under heavy makeup, someone tough and knowing. But here she was, dewy and fresh, bespectacled, olive-skinned, almost childlike, smiling shyly at him and sucking a milkshake through a straw. She looked like a university freshman who was innocent or dumb, or both.</p><p>“I just want to be sure that you’re sure about doing this,” he told her. Then, worried that he might frighten her away, he added, “I’m very grateful, and it won’t take too much from you—in a year I’ll have my papers and we’ll do the divorce. But I just wanted to meet you first and make sure you are O.K. to do this.”</p><p>“Yes,” she said.</p><p>He watched her, expecting more. She played with her straw, not meeting his eyes, and it took him a while to realize that she was reacting more to him than to the situation. She was attracted to him.</p><p>“I want to help my mom out. Things are tight at home,” she said, a trace of a non-British accent underlining her words.</p><p>“She’s with us, yeah,” one of the Angolans said impatiently.</p><p>“Show him your details, Cleo,” the other Angolan said.</p><p>His calling her Cleo rang false; Obinze sensed this from the slight surprise on her face. It was a forced intimacy: the Angolan had never called her Cleo before. Obinze wondered how the Angolans knew her. Did they have a list of young women with European Union passports who needed money? Cleotilde pushed at her hair, a mass of tight coils, and adjusted her glasses, as though preparing herself, then presented her passport and license. Obinze examined them. He would have thought her younger than twenty-three.</p><p>“Can I have your number?” Obinze asked.</p><p>“Just call us for anything,” the Angolans said, almost at the same time. But Obinze wrote his number on a napkin and pushed it across to Cleotilde. The Angolans gave him a sly look.</p><p>The next day, on the phone, she told him that she had been living in London for six years, and was saving money to go to fashion school; the Angolans had<span data-page="page_2"></span> told him that she lived in Portugal.</p><p>“Would you like to meet again?” he asked. “It will be much easier if we try to get to know each other a little.”</p><p>“Yes,” she said without hesitation.</p><p>They ate fish-and-chips in a pub, a thin crust of grime on the sides of the wooden table, while she talked about her love of fashion and asked him about Nigerian traditional dress. She seemed a little more mature this time; he noticed the shimmer on her cheeks, the more defined curl of her hair, and knew that she had made an effort with her appearance.</p><p>“What will you do after you get your papers?” she asked him. “Will you bring your girlfriend from Nigeria?”</p><p>He was touched by her obviousness. “I don’t have a girlfriend.”</p><p>“I’ve never been to Africa. I’d love to go.” She said “Africa” wistfully, like an admiring foreigner, loading the word with exotic excitement. Her black Angolan father had left her white Portuguese mother when she was three, she told him, and she had not seen him since, nor had she ever been to Angola. She said this with a shrug and a cynical raise of her eyebrows, as though it had never bothered her, an effort so out of character, so jarring, that it showed him just how deeply it did bother her. There were difficulties in her life that he wanted to know more about, parts of her thick, shapely body that he longed to touch, but he was wary of complicating things. He would wait until after the wedding, until the business side of their relationship was finished. She seemed to understand this without their talking about it. And so, as they met in the following weeks, sometimes practicing how they would answer questions during their immigration interview and other times just talking about football, there was, between them, the growing urgency of restrained desire. It was there in how close they stood, not touching, as they waited at the tube station, and in their teasing each other about his support of Arsenal and her support of Manchester United. After he paid the Angolans the additional two thousand pounds, she told him that they had given her only five hundred.</p><p>“I’m just telling you. I know you don’t have any more money. I want to do this for you,” she said.</p><p>He wanted to kiss her, her upper lip pinker and shinier with lip gloss than the lower, to hold her, to tell her how deeply, irrepressibly grateful he was. She would never flaunt her power over him. One Eastern European woman, Iloba had told him, had asked a Nigerian man, an hour before their wedding, to give her a thousand pounds extra not to walk away. In a panic, the man had had to call all of his friends to raise the money.</p><p>When Obinze asked the Angolans how much they had given Cleotilde, they said, “Man, we gave you a good deal,” in the tone of people who knew how much they were needed. It was they, after all, who took him to a lawyer, a low-voiced Nigerian in a swivel chair, who slid backward to reach a file cabinet as he said, “You can still get married, even though your visa is expired. In fact, getting married is now your only choice.” It was they who provided water and gas bills, going back six months, with his name and a Newcastle address. And it was they who found a man who would “sort out” his driver’s license, a man called Brown. Obinze met Brown at the train station in Barking; he stood near the gate, amid the bustle of people, looking around and waiting for his phone to ring, since Brown had refused to give him a phone number.</p><p>“Are you waiting for somebody?” Brown asked, when he appeared. He was a slight man, his winter hat pulled down to his eyebrows.</p><p>“Yes. I’m Obinze,” he said, feeling like a character in a spy novel. Brown led him to a quiet corner, handed over an envelope, and there it was, his license, with his photo. It had the genuine, slightly worn look of something owned for a year. A small plastic card, but it weighed down his pocket. A few days later, he walked with it into a London building that looked like a church, steepled and grave from the outside, but inside was shabby, harried, knotted with people. Signs were scrawled on whiteboards:</p><p>Births and deaths this way. Marriage registration this way.</p><p>Obinze, his expression carefully frozen in neutrality, handed the license over to the registrar behind the desk.</p><p>A woman was walking toward the door, talking loudly to her companion. “Look how crowded this place is,” she said. “It’s all sham marriages, all of them, now that Blunkett is after them.”</p><p>Perhaps she had come to register a death, and her words were merely the lonely lashings-out of grief, but he felt the familiar tightening of panic in his chest. The registrar was examining his license, taking too long. The seconds lengthened and curdled. “<em>All sham marriages, all of them,”</em> rang in Obinze’s head. Finally, the registrar looked up and pushed across a form.</p><p>“Getting married, are we? Congratulations!” The words came out with the mechanical good cheer of frequent repetition.</p><p>“Thank you,” Obinze said, and tried to unfreeze his<span data-page="page_3"></span> face. [cartoon id="a17169"]</p><p>Behind the desk, a whiteboard was propped against a wall, with venues and dates of intended marriages scrawled in blue; a name at the bottom caught his eye. Okoli Okafor and Crystal Smith. Okoli Okafor had been his classmate in secondary school and at university, a quiet boy who had been teased for having a surname for a first name, who later joined a vicious cult at university, and then left Nigeria during one of the long strikes.</p><p>The memory, clear as a beam of light, took Obinze back to a time when he still believed the universe would bend according to his will. Once, during his final year at university, the year that people danced in the streets because General Abacha had died, his mother had said, “One day, I will look up and all the people I know will be dead or abroad.” For a moment, he felt as if he had betrayed her by having his own plan: to get a postgraduate degree in America, to work in America, to live in America. Of course, he knew how unreasonable the American Consulate could be—the vice-chancellor, of all people, had once been refused a visa to attend a conference—but he had never doubted his plan. He would wonder, later, why he had been so sure. Perhaps it was because he had never just wanted to go abroad, as many others did; some people were now even going to South Africa, which amused him. It had always been America, only America. A longing nurtured and nursed over many years. An advertisement on NTA for “Andrew Checking Out,” which he had watched as a child, had given shape to his longings. “Men, I’m checkin’ out,” the character Andrew had said, staring cockily at the camera. “No good roads, no light, no water. Men, you can’t even get a common bottle of soft drink!” While Andrew was checking out, General Buhari’s soldiers were flogging adults in the streets, lecturers were striking for better pay, and Obinze’s mother decided that he could no longer have Fanta whenever he wanted but only on Sundays. America became a place where bottles of Fanta could be had without permission. Obinze would stand in front of the mirror and repeat Andrew’s words: “Men, I’m checkin’ out!” Later, when he sought out magazines and books and films and secondhand stories about America, his longing took on a minor mystical quality. He saw himself walking the streets of Harlem, discussing the merits of Mark Twain with his American friends, gazing at Mt. Rushmore. Days after he graduated from university, bloated with knowledge about America, he applied for a visa at the Consulate in Lagos.</p><p>He already knew that the best interviewer was the man with the blond beard, and, as the line moved forward, he hoped that he would not be interviewed by the horror story, a pretty white woman famous for screaming into her microphone and insulting even grandmothers. Finally, it was his turn, and the blond-bearded man said, “Next person!” Obinze walked up and slid his forms underneath the glass. The man glanced at the forms and said, kindly, “Sorry, you don’t qualify. Next person!” Obinze was stunned. He went three more times in the next few months. Each time, he was told, with barely a glance at his documents, “Sorry, you don’t qualify,” and each time he emerged from the air-conditioned cool of the Consulate into the harsh sunlight stunned and unbelieving.</p><p>“It’s the terrorism fears,” his mother said. “The Americans are now averse to foreign young men.”</p><p>She told him to find a job and try again in a year. But his job applications yielded nothing. He travelled to Lagos and to Port Harcourt and to Abuja to take assessment tests, which he found easy, and then attended interviews, answering questions fluidly, but only long silences followed. Some of his friends got jobs, people who did not have his second-class upper degree and who did not speak as well as he did. He wondered if employers could smell his America-pining on his breath, or sense how obsessively he still looked at the Web sites of American universities.</p><p>One day, his mother left him a note on the bathroom sink: “I have been invited to an academic conference in London. We should speak.” He was puzzled. When she came home from her lecture, he was in the living room waiting for her.</p><p>“Mummy, <em>nno</em>,” he said.</p><p>She acknowledged his greeting with a nod. “I’m going to put your name on my British visa application as my research assistant,” she said quietly. “That should get you a six-month visa. You can stay with Nicholas in London. See what you can do with your life. Maybe you can get to America from there. I know that your mind is no longer here.”</p><p>He stared at her.</p><p>“I understand this sort of thing is done nowadays,” she said, sitting down on the sofa beside him, and trying to sound offhand, but in the uncommon briskness of her words he sensed her discomfort. She was a woman who asked no favors, who would not lie, who would not accept even a Christmas card from her students, because it might compromise her. Yet here she was, behaving as though truth-telling were a luxury that they could no longer afford. She had lied for him. If anyone else<span data-page="page_4"></span> had lied for him, it would not have mattered as much or even at all, but she lied for him and he got a six-month visa to the United Kingdom. He felt, even before he left, like a failure. He did not contact her for months, while he stayed with his cousin Nicholas, in Essex. He did not contact her because there was nothing to tell and he wanted to wait until he had something to tell. Throughout his stay in England, he had spoken to her only a few times, strained conversations during which he felt her wondering why he had made nothing of himself. But she never asked for details; she only waited to hear what he was willing to tell.</p><p>Everyone joked about people who went abroad to clean toilets, and so Obinze approached his first job with irony: he was indeed abroad cleaning toilets, wearing rubber gloves and carrying a pail, in an estate agent’s office on the second floor of a London building. Each time he opened the swinging door of a stall, it seemed to sigh. The beautiful woman who cleaned the ladies’ toilet was Ghanaian, about his age, with the shiniest dark skin he had ever seen. He sensed, in the way she spoke and carried herself, that she came from a background similar to his, a childhood cushioned by family, regular meals, and dreams in which there was no conception of cleaning toilets in London. She ignored his friendly gestures, saying only “Good evening” as formally as she could, but she was friendly with the Polish woman who cleaned the offices upstairs, and once he saw them in a deserted café, drinking tea and talking in low tones. He stood watching them for a while, a great grievance exploding in his mind. He was too close to what she was; he knew her nuances, while with the Polish woman she was free to reinvent herself, to be whoever she wanted to be.</p><p>The toilets were not bad—some urine outside the urinal, some unfinished flushing. So he was shocked, one evening, to walk into a stall and discover a mound of shit on the toilet lid, solid, tapering, centered as though it had been carefully arranged. It looked like a puppy curled on a mat. It was a performance. He thought about the famed repression of the English. There was, in this performance, something of an unbuttoning. A person who had been fired? Denied a promotion? Obinze stared at that mound of shit for a long time, feeling smaller and smaller as he did so, until it became a personal affront, a punch to his jaw. And all for three quid an hour. He took off his gloves, placed them next to the mound of shit, and left the building.</p><p>Obinze had not remembered that Iloba now lived in London; he had last seen him days before graduation. Iloba was merely from his mother’s home town, but he had been so enthusiastic about their kinship that everyone on campus assumed that they were cousins. Iloba would often pull up a chair, smiling and uninvited, and join Obinze and his friends at a roadside bar, or appear at Obinze’s door on Sunday afternoons. Once, Iloba had stopped Obinze on the General Studies quad, cheerfully calling out “Kinsman!” and then giving him a rundown of marriages and deaths of people from his mother’s home town whom he hardly knew. “Udoakpuanyi died some weeks ago. Don’t you know him? Their homestead is next to your mother’s.” Obinze nodded and made appropriate sounds, humoring Iloba, because Iloba’s demeanor was always so pleasant and oblivious, his trousers always too tight and too short, showing his bony ankles; they had earned him the nickname Iloba Jump Up.</p><p>Obinze got his phone number from Nicholas and called him.</p><p>“The Zed! Kinsman! You did not tell me you were coming to London!” Iloba said, using Obinze’s old nickname. “How is your mother? What of your uncle, the one who married from Abagana? How is Nicholas?” Iloba sounded full of a simple happiness. There were people who were born with an inability to be tangled up in dark emotions, in complications, and Iloba was one of them. With such people, Obinze felt both admiration and boredom. When Obinze asked if Iloba might be able to help him find a National Insurance number, he would have understood a little resentment, a little churlishness—after all, he was contacting Iloba only because he needed something—but it surprised him how sincerely eager to help Iloba was.</p><p>“I would let you use mine, but I am working with it and it is risky,” Iloba said.</p><p>“Where do you work?”</p><p>“In central London. Security. It’s not easy, this country is not easy, but we are managing. I like the night shifts, because it gives me time to read for my course. I’m doing a master’s in management at Birkbeck College.” Iloba paused. “The Zed, don’t worry, we will put our heads together. Let me ask around and let you know.”</p><p>Iloba called back two weeks later to say that he had found somebody. “His name is Vincent Obi. He is from Abia State. A friend of mine did the connection. He wants to meet you tomorrow evening.”</p><p>They met in Iloba’s flat. A claustrophobic feel pervaded the concrete neighborhood with scarred walls and no trees. Everything<span data-page="page_5"></span> seemed too small, too tight.</p><p>“Nice place,” Obinze said, not because the flat was nice but because Iloba had a flat in London.</p><p>“I would have told you to come and stay with me, the Zed, but I live with two of my cousins.” Iloba placed bottles of beer and a small plate of fried chin-chin on the table. The ritual of hospitality raised a sharp homesickness in Obinze. He was reminded of going back to his mother’s village with her at Christmas, aunties offering him plates of chin-chin. [cartoon id="a17241"]</p><p>Vincent Obi was a small round man, submerged in a large pair of jeans and an ungainly coat. As he and Obinze shook hands, they sized each other up. From the set of Vincent’s shoulders and the abrasiveness of his manner, Obinze sensed that he had learned early on, as a matter of necessity, to solve his own problems. Obinze imagined Vincent’s Nigerian life: a community secondary school full of barefoot children; a polytechnic paid for with the help of a number of uncles; a family of many children; and a crowd of dependents in his home town who, whenever he visited, would expect large loaves of bread and pocket money carefully distributed to each of them. Obinze saw himself through Vincent’s eyes: a university staff child who grew up eating butter and now needed his help. At first, Vincent affected a British accent, saying “innit” too many times.</p><p>“This is business, innit, but I’m helping you. You can use my N.I. number and pay me forty per cent of what you make,” Vincent said. “It’s business, innit. If I don’t get what we agree on, I will report you.”</p><p>“My brother,” Obinze said. “That’s a little too much. You know my situation. I don’t have anything. Please try and come down.”</p><p>“Thirty-five per cent is the best I can do. This is business.” He lost his accent and now spoke Nigerian English. “Let me tell you, there are many people in your situation.”</p><p>Iloba spoke in Igbo: “Vincent, my brother here is trying to save money and do his papers. Thirty-five is too much. Please just try and help us.”</p><p>“You know that some people take half. Yes, he is in a situation, but all of us are in a situation. I am helping him, but this is business.” Vincent’s Igbo had a rural accent. He put the National Insurance card on the table and started to write his bank-account number on a piece of paper. That evening, as dusk fell, the sky muting to a pale violet, Obinze became Vincent.</p><p>The warehouse chief looked like the archetype of an Englishman that Obinze carried in his mind: tall and spare, sandy-haired and blue-eyed. But he was a smiling man, and in Obinze’s imagination Englishmen were not smiling men. His name was Roy Snell. He vigorously shook Obinze’s hand.</p><p>“So, Vincent, you’re from Africa?” he asked, as he took Obinze around the warehouse, which was the size of a football field and alive with trucks being loaded, flattened cardboard boxes being folded into a deep pit, and men talking.</p><p>“Yes. I was born in Birmingham and went back to Nigeria when I was six.” It was the story that he and Iloba had agreed was most convincing.</p><p>“Why did you come back? How bad are things in Nigeria?”</p><p>“I just wanted to see if I could have a better life here.”</p><p>Roy Snell nodded. He seemed like a person for whom the word “jolly” would always be apt. “You’ll work with Nigel today—he’s our youngest,” he said, gesturing toward a man with a pale doughy body, spiky dark hair, and an almost cherubic face. “I think you’ll like working here, Vinny Boy!” It had taken him five minutes to go from Vincent to Vinny Boy and, in the following months, when they played table tennis during lunch break, Roy would tell the men, “I’ve got to beat Vinny Boy for once!” And they would titter and repeat “Vinny Boy.”</p><p>It amused Obinze how keenly the men flipped through their newspapers every morning, stopping at the photo of the big-breasted woman, examining it as though it were an article of great interest, different from the photo on that same page the previous day, the previous week. Their conversations, as they waited for their trucks to be loaded up, were always about cars and football and, most of all, women, each man telling stories that sounded similar to stories told the day before, the week before. Each time they mentioned knickers—“the bird flashed her knickers”—Obinze was even more amused, because knickers, in Nigerian English, were shorts rather than underwear, and he imagined these nubile women in ill-fitting khaki shorts, the kind he had worn as a junior student in secondary school.</p><p>Roy Snell’s greeting every morning was a jab to his belly. “Vinny Boy! You all right? You all right?” he would ask. He always put Obinze’s name up for the outside work that paid better, always asked if he wanted to work weekends, which was double time, always asked about girls. It was as if Roy held a special affection for him, which was both protective and kind.</p><p>“You haven’t had a shag since you came to the U.K., have you, Vinny Boy? I could give you this bird’s number,” he said once.</p><p>“I have a girlfriend back home,”<span data-page="page_6"></span> Obinze said.</p><p>“So what’s wrong with a little shag, then?”</p><p>A few men nearby laughed.</p><p>“My girlfriend has magical powers,” Obinze said.</p><p>Roy found this funnier than Obinze thought it was. He laughed and laughed. “She’s into witchcraft, is she? All right, then, no shags for you. I’ve always wanted to go to Africa, Vinny Boy. I think I’ll take a holiday and go to Nigeria when you’re back there for a visit. You can show me around, find me some Nigerian birds, Vinny Boy, but no witchcraft!”</p><p>“Yes, I could do that.”</p><p>“Oh, I know you could! You look like you know what to do with the birds,” Roy said, with another jab at Obinze’s belly.</p><p>Roy often assigned Obinze to work with Nigel, perhaps because they were the youngest men in the warehouse. That first morning, Obinze noticed that the other men, drinking coffee from paper cups and checking the board to see who would be working with whom, were laughing at Nigel. Nigel had no eyebrows; the patches of slightly pink skin where his eyebrows should have been gave his plump face an unfinished, ghostly look.</p><p>“I got pissed at the pub and my mates shaved off my eyebrows,” Nigel told Obinze, almost apologetically, as they shook hands.</p><p>“No shagging for you until you grow your eyebrows back, mate,” one of the men called out as Nigel and Obinze headed for the truck. Obinze secured the washing machines at the back, tightening the straps until they were snug, and then climbed in and studied the map to find the shortest routes to their delivery addresses. Nigel took bends sharply and muttered about how people drove these days. At a traffic light, he brought out a bottle of cologne from a bag he had placed at his feet, sprayed it on his neck, and then offered it to Obinze.</p><p>“No, thanks,” Obinze said. Nigel shrugged. Days later, he offered it again. The truck interior was dense with the scent of his cologne and, from time to time, Obinze would take deep gulps of fresh air through the open window.</p><p>“You’re just new from Africa. You haven’t seen the London sights, have you, mate?” Nigel asked.</p><p>“No,” Obinze said.</p><p>And so, after early deliveries in central London, Nigel would take him for a drive, showing him Buckingham Palace, the Houses of Parliament, Tower Bridge, all the while talking about his mother’s arthritis, and about his girlfriend Haley’s knockers. It took a while for Obinze to completely understand what Nigel said, because of his accent, each word twisted and stretched. Once Nigel said “male” and Obinze thought he had said “mile,” and, when Obinze finally understood what Nigel meant, Nigel laughed and said, “You talk kind of posh, don’t you? African posh.”</p><p>One day, months into his job, after they had delivered a fridge to an address in Kensington, Nigel said, of the elderly man who had come into the kitchen while they were installing it, “He’s a real gent, he is.” Nigel’s tone was admiring, slightly cowed. The man had looked dishevelled and hungover, his hair tousled, his robe open at the chest, and he had said, archly, “You do know how to put it all together,” as though he did not think they did. It amazed Obinze that, because Nigel thought the man was a “real gent,” he did not complain about the dirty kitchen, as he ordinarily would have done. If the man had spoken with a different accent, Nigel would have called him miserly for not giving them a tip.</p><p>They were approaching their next delivery address, in South London, and Obinze had just called the homeowner to say that they were almost there, when Nigel blurted out, “What do you say to a girl you like?”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Obinze asked.</p><p>“Truth is, I’m not really shagging Haley. I like her, but I don’t know how to tell her. The other day, I went round her house and there was another bloke there.” Nigel paused. Obinze tried to keep his face expressionless. “You look like you know what to say to the birds, mate,” Nigel added.</p><p>“Just tell her you like her,” Obinze said, thinking how seamlessly Nigel, at the warehouse with the other men, contributed stories about shagging Haley, and, once, about shagging her friend while Haley was away on holiday. “No games and no lines. Just say, ‘Look, I like you and I think you’re beautiful.’ ”</p><p>Nigel gave him a wounded glance. It was as if he had convinced himself that Obinze was skilled in the art of women; he expected some profundity, which Obinze wished, as he loaded a dishwasher onto a trolley and wheeled it to the door, that he had. An Indian woman opened the door, a portly, kindly housewife, who offered them tea. Many people offered tea or water. A sad-looking woman had once offered Obinze a small pot of homemade jam, and he had hesitated, but he sensed that whatever deep unhappiness she had would be compounded if he said no, and so he had taken the jam home, where it was still languishing in the fridge, unopened.</p><p>“Thank you, thank you,” the Indian woman said, as Obinze and Nigel installed the new dishwasher and rolled away the old one.</p><p>At the door, she gave Nigel a tip. Nigel was the only driver who split the<span data-page="page_7"></span> tips down the middle with Obinze; the others pretended not to remember to share. Once, when Obinze was working with another driver, an old Jamaican woman pushed ten pounds into his pocket when the driver wasn’t looking. “Thank you, brother,” she said, and it made him want to call his mother in Nsukka and tell her about it.</p><p>One morning in early summer, Obinze arrived at the warehouse and knew right away that something was amiss. The men avoided his eyes, and Nigel turned swiftly—too swiftly—toward the toilet when he saw Obinze. They knew. They had somehow found out. They saw the headlines about asylum seekers draining the National Health Service, they thought of the hordes further crowding a crowded island, and now they knew that he was one of the damned, working with a name that was not his. Where was Roy Snell? Had he gone to call the police? Was it the police that you called? Obinze tried to remember details from the stories of people who had been caught and deported, but his mind was numb. He felt naked. He wanted to turn and run, but his body kept moving, against his will, toward the loading area. Then he sensed a movement behind him, quick and violent and too close, and, before he could turn around, a paper hat was pushed onto his head. It was Nigel, and with him a crowd of grinning men.</p><p>“Happy birthday, Vinny Boy!” they all said. [cartoon id="a17269"]</p><p>Obinze froze, frightened by the complete blankness of his mind. Then he realized what it was. Vincent’s birthday. Roy must have told the men. Even he had not remembered to remember Vincent’s date of birth.</p><p>“Oh!” was all he said, nauseated with relief.</p><p>Nigel asked him to come into the coffee room, where all the men were trooping in, passing around the muffins and Coke they had bought with their own money in honor of a birthday they believed was his. A realization brought tears to his eyes: he felt safe.</p><p>Obinze was mildly surprised when Vincent called him that night, because he had called him only once before, months ago, when he changed his bank and wanted to give him the new account number. He wondered whether to say “Happy birthday” to Vincent, whether the call was indeed related to his birthday.</p><p>“Vincent, <em>kedu</em>?” he said.</p><p>“I want a raise.”</p><p>Had Vincent learned that from a film? The words sounded contrived and comical. “I want forty-five per cent. I know you are working more now.”</p><p>“Vincent, ahn-ahn. How much am I making? You know I am saving money to do this marriage thing.”</p><p>“Forty-five per cent,” Vincent said, and hung up.</p><p>Obinze decided to ignore him. He knew Vincent’s type; he would push to see how far he could go and then he would retreat. If Obinze called back and tried to negotiate, it might embolden Vincent to make more demands. But he would not risk losing Obinze’s regular weekly deposit entirely.</p><p>And so when, a week later, in the morning bustle of drivers and trucks, Roy said, “Vinny Boy, step into my office for a minute,” Obinze thought nothing of it. On Roy’s desk was a newspaper, folded at the page with the photo of the big-breasted woman. Roy slowly put his cup of coffee on top of the newspaper. He seemed uncomfortable, and wouldn’t look directly at Obinze.</p><p>“Somebody called yesterday,” he told Obinze. “Said you’re not who you say you are—that you’re illegal and working with a Brit’s name.” There was a pause. Obinze was stung with surprise. Roy picked up the coffee cup again. “Why don’t you just bring in your passport tomorrow and we’ll clear it up, all right?”</p><p>Obinze mumbled the first words that came to him. “O.K. I’ll bring my passport tomorrow.” He walked out of the office knowing that he would never feel again what he had felt moments ago. Was Roy merely asking him to bring in his passport to make the dismissal easier for him, to give him an exit, or did Roy really believe that the caller had been lying? Why would anybody call about such a thing unless it was true? Obinze had never made as much of an effort as he did the rest of the day to seem normal, to tame the rage that was engulfing him. It was not the thought of the power that Vincent had over him that infuriated him but the recklessness with which Vincent had exercised it. He left the warehouse that evening for the final time, wishing more than anything that he had told Nigel and Roy his real name.</p><p>The Angolans told him that things had “gone up,” or were “tough,” opaque words that were supposed to explain each new request for more money.</p><p>“This is not what we agreed to,” Obinze would say, or “I don’t have any extra cash right now,” and they would reply, “Things have gone up, yeah,” in a tone that he imagined was accompanied by a shrug. A silence would follow, a wordlessness over the phone line that told him that it was his problem, not theirs. “I’ll pay it in by Friday,” he would say, finally, before hanging up.</p><p>Nicholas gave Obinze a suit for the wedding. “It’s a good Italian suit,” he said. “It’s small for me, so it should<span data-page="page_8"></span> fit you.” The trousers were big, and they bunched up when Obinze tightened his belt, but the jacket, also big, shielded the unsightly pleat of cloth at his waist. Not that he minded. He was so focussed on finally beginning his life that he would have swaddled his lower parts in a baby’s napkin if it had been required. He and Iloba met Cleotilde near City Center. She was standing under a tree with some friends, her hair pushed back with a white band, her eyes boldly lined in black; she looked like an older, sexier person. Her ivory dress was tight at the hips. He had paid for the dress. “I haven’t got any proper going-out dress,” she had said, in apology, when she called to tell him that she had nothing that looked convincingly bridal.</p><p>She hugged him. She looked nervous, and he tried to deflect his own nervousness by thinking about them together after this—how, in less than an hour, he would be free to walk with surer steps on Britain’s streets, and free to kiss her.</p><p>“You have the rings?” Iloba asked her.</p><p>“Yes,” Cleotilde said.</p><p>She and Obinze had bought them the week before, plain, cheap matching rings from a side-street shop, and she had looked so delighted, laughingly slipping different rings on and off her finger, that he wondered if she wished it were a real wedding.</p><p>“Fifteen minutes to go,” Iloba said. He took pictures, his digital camera held away from his face, saying, “Move closer! O.K., one more!” His sprightly good spirits annoyed Obinze. On the train up to Newcastle the previous day, while Obinze had spent his time looking out the window, unable even to read, Iloba had talked and talked, until his voice became a distant murmur, perhaps because he was trying to keep Obinze from worrying too much. Now he talked to Cleotilde’s friends with easy friendliness about the new Chelsea manager, about “Big Brother,” as if they were all there for something ordinary and normal.</p><p>“Time to go,” Iloba said. They walked toward the civic center. The afternoon was bright with sunshine. Obinze opened the door and stood aside for the others to go ahead, into the sterile hallway, where they paused to get their bearings, to be sure which way the registry office was. Two policemen stood behind the door, watching them with stony eyes. Obinze quieted his panic. There was nothing to worry about, nothing at all, he told himself; the civic center probably had policemen present as a matter of routine. But he sensed in the sudden smallness of the hallway, the sudden thickening of doom in the air, that something was wrong. Then another man approached him, his shirtsleeves rolled up, his cheeks so red that he looked as though he were wearing terrible makeup.</p><p>“Are you Obinze Maduewesi?” the red-cheeked man asked. In his hands was a sheaf of papers in which Obinze could see a photocopy of his passport.</p><p>“Yes,” Obinze said quietly, and that word was an acknowledgment to the red-cheeked immigration officer, to Iloba, to Cleotilde, and to himself that it was over.</p><p>“Your visa is expired and you are not allowed to be present in the U.K.,” the man said.</p><p>One of the policemen clamped handcuffs around his wrists. He felt himself watching the scene from far away, watching himself walk to the police car outside, and sink into the too-soft seat in the back. There had been so many times in the past when he had feared that this would happen, so many moments that had become one single blur of panic, and now it felt like the dull echo of an aftermath. Cleotilde flung herself on the ground and began to cry. She may never have visited her father’s country, but he was convinced at that moment of her Africanness; how else would she have been able to fling herself to the ground with that perfect dramatic flourish? He wondered if her tears were for him or for herself, or for what might have been between them. She had no need to worry; the policemen barely glanced at her. It was he who felt the heaviness of the handcuffs during the drive to the police station, he who silently handed over his watch and his belt and his wallet and his phone. Nicholas’s large trousers were slipping down his hips.</p><p>“Your shoes, too. Take off your shoes,” the policeman said.</p><p>He took off his shoes. He was led to a cell. It was small, with brown walls, and metal bars so thick that his hand could not get around one. It reminded him of the chimpanzee cage at Nsukka’s dismal, forgotten zoo. From the high ceiling, a single bulb burned. There was an emptying, echoing vastness in the tiny cell.</p><p>“Were you aware that your visa had expired?”</p><p>“Yes,” Obinze said.</p><p>“Were you about to have a sham marriage?”</p><p>“No. Cleotilde and I have been dating for a while.”</p><p>“I can arrange for a lawyer for you, but it’s obvious you’ll be deported,” the immigration officer said evenly.</p><p>When the lawyer came, puffy-faced, dark arcs under his eyes, Obinze thought of all the films in which the state lawyer is distracted and exhausted. He came with a bag but did not open it, and he sat across from Obinze, holding nothing—no file, no paper, no pen. He<span data-page="page_final"></span> was pleasant and sympathetic.</p><p>“The government has a strong case. We can appeal, but, to be honest, it will only delay the case. You will eventually be removed from the U.K.,” he said, with the air of a man who had said those same words, in the same tone, more times than he wished to, or could, remember.</p><p>“I’m willing to go back to Nigeria,” Obinze said. The last shred of his dignity was like a wrapper slipping off his waist that he was desperate to retie.</p><p>The lawyer looked surprised. “O.K., then,” he said, and got up a little too hastily, as though grateful that his job had been made easier. Obinze watched him leave. He was going to check a box on a form that said that his client was willing to be removed. Removed. The word made Obinze feel inanimate. A thing to be removed. A thing without breath and mind. A thing. ♦</p>	Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie	March 18, 2013 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/03/18/checking-out	Africans	America	Arranged Marriages	Deliveries	Deportations	Illegal Immigrants	Obinze	Third	Immigrants
East Wind	<p>The <span data-page="page_1"></span>previous November, a row of wooden beach huts, their paintwork lifted and flaked by the hard east wind, had burned to the ground. The fire brigade came from twelve miles away, and had nothing to do by the time it arrived. “<em class="small">YOBS ON RAMPAGE</em>,” the local paper decided, though no culprit was ever found. An architect from a more fashionable part of the coastline told the regional TV news that the huts had been part of the town’s social heritage and must be rebuilt. The council announced that it would consider all options, but since then had done nothing.</p><p>Vernon had moved to the town only a few months before, and had no feelings about the beach huts. If anything, their disappearance improved the view from the Right Plaice, where he sometimes had lunch. From a window table, he now looked out across a strip of concrete to damp shingle, a bored sky, and a lifeless sea. That was the east coast: for months on end you got bits of bad weather and lots of no weather. This was fine by him: he’d moved here to have no weather in his life.</p><p>“You are done?”</p><p>He didn’t look up at the waitress. “All the way from the Urals,” he said, still gazing at the long, flat sea.</p><p>“Pardon?”</p><p>“Nothing between here and the Urals. That’s where the wind comes from. Nothing to stop it. Straight across all those countries.” Cold enough to freeze your knob off, he might have added in other circumstances.</p><p>“<em>Oorals</em>,” she repeated. As he caught the accent, he looked up at her. A broad face, streaked hair, chunky body, and not doing any waitressy number in hope of a bigger tip. Must be one of those Eastern Europeans who were all over the country nowadays. Building trade, pubs and restaurants, fruit picking. Came over here in vans and coaches, lived in rabbit warrens, made themselves a bit of money. Some stayed; some went home. Vernon didn’t mind one way or the other. That’s what he found more often than not these days: he didn’t mind one way or the other.</p><p>“Are you from one of them?”</p><p>“One of what?”</p><p>“One of those countries. Between here and the Urals.”</p><p>“<em>Oorals</em>. Yes, perhaps.”</p><p>That was an odd answer, he thought. Or maybe her sense of geography wasn’t so strong.</p><p>“Fancy a swim?”</p><p>“A swim?”</p><p>“Yes, you know. Swim. Splash splash, front crawl, breaststroke.”</p><p>“No swim.”</p><p>“Fine,” he said. He hadn’t meant it, anyway. “Bill, please.”</p><p>As he waited, he looked back across the damp concrete to the shingle. A beach hut had recently sold for twenty grand. Or was it thirty? Somewhere down on the south coast. Spiralling house prices, the market going mad: that’s what the papers said. Not that it touched this part of the country, or the property he dealt in. The market had bottomed out here long ago, the graph as horizontal as the sea. Old people died, and you sold their flats and houses to people who would get old in them in their turn, and then die. That was a lot of his trade. The town wasn’t fashionable, never had been. Londoners carried on up the A12 to somewhere pricier. Fine by him. He’d lived in London all his life until the divorce. Now he had a quiet job, a rented flat, and saw the kids every other weekend. When they got older, they’d probably be bored with this place and start acting the little snobs. But for the moment they liked the sea, throwing pebbles into it, eating chips.</p><p>When she brought the bill, he said, “We could run away together and live in a beach hut.”</p><p>“I do not think,” she replied, shaking her head, as if she believed he meant it. Oh, well, the old English sense of humor—takes a while for people to get used to it.</p><p>He had a few rentals to attend to—changes of tenancy, redecoration, damp problems—and then a sale up the coast, so he didn’t return to the Right Plaice for a few weeks. He ate his haddock and mushies, and read the paper. There was some town in Lincolnshire that was suddenly half Polish, there’d been so many immigrants. Nowadays, more Catholics went to church on Sundays than Anglicans, they were saying, what with all these Eastern Europeans. He didn’t mind one way or the other. Actually, he liked the Poles he’d met—brickies, plasterers, electricians. Good workers, well trained, did what they said they would, trustworthy. It was time the good old British building trade had a kick up the arse, Vernon thought.</p><p>The sun was out that day, slanting low across the sea, annoying his eyes. Late March, and bits of spring were getting even to this part of the coast.</p><p>“How about that swim, then?” he asked as she brought the bill.</p><p>“Oh, no. No swim.”</p><p>“I’m guessing you might be Polish.”</p><p>“My name is Andrea,” she replied.</p><p>“Not that I mind whether you’re Polish or not.”</p><p>“I do not also.”</p><p>The thing was, he’d never been much good at flirting—never quite said the right thing. And since the divorce he’d got worse at it, if that was possible, because his heart wasn’t in it. Where was his heart? Question for another day. Today’s subject: flirting. He knew all too well the look in a woman’s eye<span data-page="page_2"></span> when you didn’t get it right. Where’s he coming from, the look said. Anyway, it took two to flirt. And maybe he was getting too old for it. Thirty-seven, father of two, Gary, eight, and Melanie, five. That’s how the papers would put it if he was washed up on the coast some morning.</p><p>“I’m an estate agent,” he said. That was another line that often hampered flirting.</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>“I buy and sell houses. And flats. And we do rentals. Rooms, flats, houses.”</p><p>“Is it interesting?”</p><p>“It’s a living.”</p><p>“We all need living.”</p><p>He suddenly thought, No, you can’t flirt, either. Maybe you can flirt in your own language, but you can’t do it in English, so we’re even. He also thought, She looks sturdy. Maybe I need someone sturdy. She might be my age, for all I know. Not that he minded one way or the other. He wasn’t going to ask her out.</p><p>He asked her out. There was little enough choice of “out” in this town. One cinema, a few pubs, and the couple of restaurants where she didn’t work. Apart from that, there was bingo for the old people whose flats he would sell when they were dead, and a club where some halfhearted Goths loitered. Kids drove into Colchester on a Friday night and bought enough drugs to see them through the weekend. No wonder they’d burned down the beach huts.</p><p>He liked her at first for what she wasn’t. She wasn’t flirty; she wasn’t gabby; she wasn’t pushy. She didn’t mind that he was an estate agent, or that he was divorced with two kids. Other women had taken a quick look and said no. He reckoned women were more attracted to men who were still in their marriages, however fucked up those marriages were, than to ones who were picking up the pieces afterward. Not surprising, really. But Andrea didn’t mind all that. Didn’t ask questions much. Didn’t answer them, either, for that matter. The first time they kissed, he thought of asking if she was really Polish, but then he forgot.</p><p>He suggested coming back with him, but she refused. She said she’d come the next time. He spent an anxious few days wondering what it would be like to go to bed with someone new after so long. He drove fifteen miles up the coast to buy condoms where no one knew him. Not that he was ashamed or embarrassed; just didn’t want anyone knowing, or guessing, his business.</p><p>“This is a nice apartment.”</p><p>“Well, if an estate agent can’t find himself a decent flat, what’s the world coming to?”</p><p>She had an overnight bag with her; she took off her clothes in the bathroom and came back in a nightdress. They climbed into bed and he turned out the light. She felt very tense to him. He felt very tense to himself.</p><p>“We could just cuddle,” he suggested.</p><p>“What is cuddle?”</p><p>He demonstrated.</p><p>“So cuddle is not fucking?”</p><p>“No, cuddle is not fucking.”</p><p>“O.K., cuddle.”</p><p>After that they relaxed, and she soon fell asleep.</p><p>The next time, after some kissing, he reacquainted himself with the lubricated struggle of the condom. He knew he was meant to unroll it, but found himself trying to tug it on like a sock, pulling at the rim in a haphazard way. Doing it in the dark didn’t help, either. But she didn’t say anything, or cough discouragingly, and eventually he turned toward her. She pulled up her nightie and he climbed on top of her. His mind was half filled with lust and fucking, and half empty, as if wondering what he was up to. He didn’t think about her very much that first time. It was a question of looking out for yourself. Later you could look out for the other person.</p><p>“Was that O.K.?” he said after a while.</p><p>“Yes, was O.K.”</p><p>Vernon laughed in the dark.</p><p>“Are you laughing at me? Was not O.K. for you?”</p><p>“Andrea,” he said, “everything’s O.K. Nobody’s laughing at you. I won’t let anyone laugh at you.” As she slept, he thought, We’re starting again, both of us. I don’t know what she’s had in her past, but maybe we’re both starting again from the same sort of low point, and that’s O.K. Everything’s O.K.</p><p>The next night, she was more relaxed, and gripped him hard with her legs. He couldn’t tell whether she came or not.</p><p>“Gosh, you’re strong,” he said afterward.</p><p>“Is strong bad?”</p><p>“No, no. Not at all. Strong’s good.”</p><p>But the time after he noticed that she didn’t grip him so hard. She didn’t much like him playing with her breasts, either. No, that was unfair. She didn’t seem to mind if he did or didn’t. Or, rather, if he wanted to, that was fine, but it was for him, not for her. That’s what he understood, anyway. And who said you had to talk about everything right away?</p><p>Now he was glad neither of them was any good at flirting. Flirting was a kind of deception. Whereas Andrea was never anything but straight with him. She didn’t talk much, but what she said was what she did. She would meet him where and when he asked, and be standing there, looking out for him, brushing a streak of hair out of her eyes, holding on to her<span data-page="page_3"></span> bag more firmly than was necessary in this town.</p><p>“You’re as reliable as a Polish builder,” he told her one day.</p><p>“Is that good?”</p><p>“That’s very good.”</p><p>“Is English expression?”</p><p>“It is now.”</p><p>She asked him to correct her English when she made a mistake. He got her to say “I don’t think so” instead of “I do not think,” but, actually, he preferred the way she talked. He always understood her, and those phrases that weren’t quite right seemed part of her. Maybe he didn’t want her talking like an Englishwoman in case she started behaving like one—well, like one in particular. And, anyway, he didn’t want to play the teacher.</p><p>It was the same in bed. Things are what they are, he said to himself. If she always wore a nightie, perhaps it was a Catholic thing—not that she ever mentioned going to church. When he asked her to do stuff to him, she did it, and seemed to enjoy it, but she didn’t ask him to do stuff back to her—didn’t even seem to like his hand down there much. But this didn’t bother him; she was allowed to be who she was.</p><p>She never asked him in. If he dropped her off, she’d be trotting up the concrete path before he’d got the hand brake on; if he picked her up, she’d already be outside, waiting. At first this was fine, then it began to feel a bit odd, so he asked to see where she lived, just for a minute, so he could imagine where she was when she wasn’t with him. They went back into the house—nineteen-thirties semi, pebble dash, multi-occupation, metal window frames rusting up badly—and she opened her door. His professional eye took in the dimensions, furnishings, and probable rental cost; his lover’s eye took in a small dressing table with photos in plastic frames and a picture of the Virgin. There was a single bed, a tiny sink, a rubbish microwave, a small TV, and clothes on hangers clipped precariously to the picture rail. Something in him was touched by seeing her life laid out like that in the minute or so before they stepped outside again. To cover this sudden emotion, Vernon said, “You shouldn’t be paying more than fifty-five. Plus services. I can get you somewhere bigger for the same price.”</p><p>“Is O.K.”</p><p>Now that spring was here, they went for drives. They drove into Suffolk and looked at English things: half-timber houses with no damp courses, thatched roofs that put you in a higher insurance band. They stopped by a village green and he sat down on a bench overlooking a pond, but she didn’t fancy that, so they looked at the church instead. He hoped she wouldn’t ask him to explain the difference between Anglicans and Catholics—or the history behind it all. Something about Henry VIII wanting to get married again. The King’s knob. All sorts of things came down to sex if you looked at them closely enough. But, anyway, she didn’t ask.</p><p>She began to take his arm, and to smile more easily. He gave her a key to his flat; tentatively, she started leaving overnight stuff there. One Sunday, in the dark, he reached across to the bedside drawer and found the condom packet was empty. He swore, and had to explain.</p><p>“Is O.K.”</p><p>“No, Andrea, is bloody not O.K. Last thing I need is you getting pregnant.”</p><p>“I do not think so. Not get pregnant. Is O.K.”</p><p>He trusted her. Later, as she slept, he wondered what exactly she’d meant. That she couldn’t have kids? Or that she was taking something herself, to make doubly sure? If so, what would the Virgin Mary have to say about that? Let’s hope she isn’t relying on the rhythm method, he suddenly thought. Guaranteed to fail on a regular basis and keep the Pope as happy as Larry.</p><p>Time passed. She met Gary and Melanie; they took to her. She didn’t tell them what to do; they told her, and she went along with it. They also asked her some questions he’d never dared, or cared, to ask.</p><p>“Andrea, are you married?”</p><p>“Can we watch TV as long as we like?”</p><p>“Were you married?”</p><p>“If I ate three, would I be sick?”</p><p>“Why aren’t you married?”</p><p>“How old are you?”</p><p>“What team do you support?”</p><p>“You got any children?”</p><p>“Will you take me to the toilet?”</p><p>“Are you and Dad getting married?”</p><p>He learned the answers to some of these questions. Like any sensible woman, Andrea wasn’t telling her age. One night, in the dark, after he’d delivered the kids back and was too upset for sex, as he always was on those occasions, he said, “Do you think you could love me?”</p><p>“Yes, I think I would love you.”</p><p>“Is that a would or a could?”</p><p>“What is the difference?”</p><p>He paused. “There’s no difference. I’ll take either. I’ll take both. I’ll take whatever you’ve got to give.”</p><p>He didn’t know how it started, the next bit. Because he was beginning to fall in love with her, or because he didn’t really want to? Or wanted to but was afraid? Or was it that, deep down, he had an urge to fuck everything up? That’s what his wife—ex-wife—had said to him one morning over breakfast: “Look, Vernon, I<span data-page="page_4"></span> don’t hate you, I really don’t. I just can’t live with you because you always fuck things up.” Her statement seemed to come out of the blue. True, he snored, and dropped his clothes where he shouldn’t, and watched the normal amount of sports on TV. But he came home on time, loved his kids, didn’t chase other women. In some people’s eyes, that was the same as fucking things up.</p><p>“Can I ask you something?”</p><p>“For sure.”</p><p>“No, ‘for sure’ is American. English is ‘yes.’ ”</p><p>She looked at him, as if to say, Why are you now correcting my English? “Yes,” she repeated.</p><p>“When I didn’t have a condom and you said it was O.K., did you mean it was O.K. then or O.K. always?”</p><p>“O.K. always.”</p><p>“Blimey, do you know what a twelve-pack costs?”</p><p>That was the wrong thing to say, even he could see that. Christ, maybe she’d had some terrible abortion or been raped or something.</p><p>“So you can’t have children?”</p><p>“No. Do you hate me?”</p><p>“Andrea, for God’s sake.” He took her hand. “I’ve got two kids already. Point is, is it O.K. with you?”</p><p>She looked down. “No. Is not O.K. with me. It makes me very unhappy.”</p><p>“Well, we could . . . I don’t know, see the doctor. See an expert.” He imagined that the experts over here were more clued up.</p><p>“No, no expert. <em>No expert</em>.”</p><p>“Fine, no experts.”</p><p>He thought, Adoption? But can I afford another, with my outgoings?</p><p>He stopped buying condoms. He started asking questions, as tactfully as he could. But tact was like flirting: either you had it or you didn’t. No, that wasn’t right. It was just easier to be tactful if you didn’t care whether you knew things or not, harder when you cared.</p><p>“Why are you now asking these questions?”</p><p>“Am I?”</p><p>“Yes, I think so.”</p><p>“Sorry.”</p><p>But he was only sorry that she’d noticed. Also sorry that he wouldn’t stop. Couldn’t stop. When they first got together, he’d liked the fact that he didn’t know anything about her; it had made things different, fresher. Gradually, she’d learned about him, while he hadn’t learned about her. Why not just continue like that? <em>Because you always fuck things up</em>, his wife, ex-wife, whispered. No, he didn’t accept that. If you fall in love, you want to know. Good, bad, indifferent. Not that you’re looking for bad things. That’s just what falling in love means, Vernon said to himself. Or thinking about falling in love. Anyway, Andrea was a nice person—he was certain about that. So what was wrong with finding out about a nice person behind her back?</p><p>They all knew him at the Right Plaice: Mrs. Ridgewell, the manageress; Jill, the other waitress; and old Herbert, who owned the restaurant but only dropped in when he fancied a free bite. Vernon chose a time when the lunch trade was starting, and walked past the counter toward the toilets. The room—more of a cupboard, really—where the staff left their coats and bags was just opposite the gents. Vernon went in, found Andrea’s bag, took her keys, and came back out flapping his hands as if to say, That whirry old hand dryer never quite does the trick, does it?</p><p>He winked at Andrea, walked to the hardware shop, complained about clients who had only one set of keys, strolled around for a bit, picked up the new set, went back to the Right Plaice, prepared a line about the chilly weather playing havoc with his bladder, didn’t need to use it, put her keys back, and ordered a cappuccino.</p><p>The first time he went, it was the sort of drizzly afternoon when no one looks at anyone who’s passing. A chap in a raincoat goes up a concrete path to a front door with frosted-glass panels. Inside, he opens another door, sits on a bed, gets up suddenly, smooths out the dent in the bed, turns, sees that the microwave isn’t rubbish, actually, puts his hand under the pillow, feels one of her nightdresses, looks at the clothes hanging from the picture rail, touches a dress she hasn’t worn before, deliberately doesn’t let himself look at the pictures on the little dressing table, sees himself out, locks up behind him. No one did anything wrong, did they?</p><p>The second time, he examined the Virgin Mary and the half-dozen pictures. He didn’t pick anything up, just went down on his haunches and looked at the photos in their plastic frames. That must be Mum, he thought, looking at the tight perm and big glasses. And there’s little Andrea, all blond and chubby. And is that a brother or a boyfriend? And here’s somebody’s birthday with so many faces you can’t tell who’s important and who isn’t. He looked again at the six- or seven-year-old Andrea—just a bit older than Melanie—and took the image home in his head.</p><p>The third time, he eased open the top drawer; it stuck, and Andrea’s mum toppled over. There was mainly underwear, most of it familiar. Then he went to the bottom drawer, because that’s where secrets are normally kept, and found only sweaters and a couple of scarves. But in the middle drawer, under some shirts, were three items he laid on the bed in the same order, and even the same distance apart, as he found them. On<span data-page="page_5"></span> the right was a medal, in the middle a photo framed in metal, on the left a passport. The photo showed four girls in a swimming pool, their arms around one another, a lane divider with cork floats separating one pair from the other.</p><p>They were all smiling up at the camera, and had wrinkles in their white rubber caps. He instantly picked out Andrea, second from the left. The medal showed a swimmer diving into a pool, with some lines of German writing on the back and a date, 1986. How old would she have been then—eighteen, twenty? The passport confirmed it: born 1967, which made her forty. It said she’d been born in Halle, so she was German.</p><p>And that was that. No diary, no letters, no vibrator. No secrets. He was in love—no, he was thinking about being in love—with a woman who’d once won a swimming medal. Where was the harm in knowing that? Not that she swam anymore. And now he remembered how she’d got all jumpy when Gary and Melanie had tried to make her go to the water’s edge and splash around. Maybe she didn’t want to be reminded. Or perhaps it was quite different, swimming in a competition pool versus having a dip in the sea. Like ballet dancers not wanting to do the sort of dancing everyone else did.</p><p>That evening, he was deliberately jolly when they met, even a bit silly, but she seemed to notice, so he stopped. After a while, he felt normal again. Almost normal, anyway. When he first started going out with girls, he’d found there were moments when he suddenly thought, I don’t understand anything at all. With his second girlfriend, Karen, for instance: they’d been jogging along nicely, no pressure, having fun, when she’d asked, “So where’s all this leading, then?” As if there were only two choices: up the aisle or up the garden path. Other times, with other women, he’d say something, just something ordinary, and—splash—he’d find himself in deep water.</p><p>They were in bed, Andrea’s nightie pulled up around her waist in the fat roll he was quite used to feeling against his belly, and he was going it a bit, when she shifted her legs and crushed him with them, like a nutcracker, he thought.</p><p>“Mmm, big strong swimmer’s legs,” he muttered.</p><p>She didn’t answer, but he knew she’d heard. He carried on, but could tell from her body that her mind wasn’t on things. Afterward, they lay on their backs, and he said some stuff, but she didn’t pick up on anything. Oh, well, work tomorrow, Vernon thought. He went to sleep.</p><p>When he dropped by the Right Plaice to pick her up that evening, Mrs. Ridgewell said Andrea had called in sick. He rang her mobile but she didn’t answer, so he texted her. Then he went around to the house and tried her bell. He left it a couple of hours, phoned again, rang the bell, then let himself in.</p><p>Her room was quite neat, and quite empty. No clothes on the picture rail, no photos on the little chest of drawers. Something made him open the microwave and look inside; all he saw was the circular plate. On the bed were two envelopes, one for the landlord, the other for Mrs. Ridgewell. Nothing for him.</p><p>Mrs. Ridgewell asked if they’d had a quarrel. No, he said, they never quarrelled.</p><p>“She was a nice girl,” the manageress said. “Very reliable.”</p><p>“Like a Polish builder.”</p><p>“I hope you didn’t say that to her. It’s not a nice remark. And I don’t think she was Polish.”</p><p>“No, she wasn’t.” He looked out to sea. “<em>Oorals</em>,” he found himself saying.</p><p>“Pardon?”</p><p>You went to the station and showed a photograph of the missing woman to the booking clerk, who remembered her face and told you where she’d bought a ticket to. That’s what they did in films. But the nearest station was twelve miles away, and it didn’t have a ticket office, just a machine you put money or plastic into. And he didn’t even have a picture of her. They’d never done that thing couples do, crowding into a booth together, the girl sitting on the man’s lap, both giggly and out of focus. They were probably too old for that, anyway.</p><p>At home, he Googled Andrea Morgen and got four hundred and ninety-seven thousand results. Then he put her in quotes and cut it down to three hundred and ninety-three. Did he want to search for “Andrea Morgan”? No, he didn’t want to search for someone else. Most of the results were in German, and he scrolled through them helplessly. He’d never done languages at school, never needed them since. Then he had a thought. He looked up an online dictionary and found the German for “swimmer.” It was a different word if you were a man or a woman. He typed in “Andrea Morgen” and “Schwimmerin.”</p><p>Eight results, all in German. Two seemed to be from newspapers, one from an official report. And there was a picture of her. The same one he’d found in the drawer: there she was, second from the left, arms around her teammates, big wrinkles in her white swimming cap. He paused, then hit “Translate this page.” Later, he found links to other pages, this time in English.</p><p>How could he<span data-page="page_final"></span> have known, he asked himself. He could barely understand the science and wasn’t interested in the politics. But he could understand, and was interested in, things that, even as he looked out at the sea from a window table in the Right Plaice, were already beginning to change his memory of her.</p><p>Halle was in what used to be East Germany. There had been a state recruiting scheme. Girls were picked out when they were as young as eleven—only four years older than that chubby little girl in the photograph. Vernon tried to put together her probable life. Her parents signing a consent form, perhaps a secrecy form as well. Andrea enrolled in the Child and Youth Sports School, then in the Dynamo Sports Club in East Berlin. She had some school lessons, but was mostly trained to swim and swim. It was a great honor to be a member of the Dynamo: that was why she’d had to leave home. Blood was taken from her earlobe to test how fit she was. There were pink pills and blue pills. Vitamins, she was told. Later, there were injections—just more vitamins. Except that they were anabolic steroids and testosterone. It was forbidden to refuse. The training motto was “You eat the pills or you die.” The coaches made sure she swallowed them.</p><p>She didn’t die. Other things happened instead. Muscles grew, but tendons didn’t, so tendons snapped. There were sudden bursts of acne, a deepening of the voice, an increase of hair on the face and body; sometimes the pubic hair grew up over the stomach, even above the navel. There was retarded growth and problems with fertility. Vernon had to look up terms like “virilization” and “clitoris hypertrophy,” then wished he hadn’t. He didn’t need to look up heart disease, liver disease, ovarian cysts, deformed children, blind children.</p><p>They doped the girls because it worked. East German swimmers won gold medals everywhere, the women especially. Not that Andrea had got to that level. When the Berlin Wall came down and the scandal broke, when they put the trainers, doctors, bureaucrats—the poisoners—on trial, her name wasn’t even mentioned. In spite of the pills, she hadn’t made the national team. The others, the ones who went public about what had been done to their bodies and their minds, at least had gold medals and a few years of fame to show for it. Andrea had come out with nothing more than a relay medal at some forgotten championship in a country that no longer existed.</p><p>Vernon looked out at the concrete strip and the shingle beach, at the gray sea and the gray sky beyond. The view was pretending that it had always been the same, for as long as people had sat at this café window. Except that there used to be a row of beach huts blocking the view. Then someone had burned them down. ♦</p>	Julian Barnes	May 19, 2008 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/05/19/east-wind	Beaches	Catholics	Condoms	Contraception	Divorce	East Germany	Vernon	Third	Immigrants
Everything Is Far from Here	<p>On the first day, there’s a sense of relief. There are other feelings, too, but relief is among them. She has arrived, at least. After three weeks. After a broken sandal strap, sunburn on her cheeks, mud in her ears, bugs in her hair, blisters around her ankles, bruises on her hips, boiled eggs, bottled water, sour berries, pickup trucks and train cars and footsteps through the dirt, sunrises and sunsets, nagging doubt and crackling hope—she has arrived.</p><p>•</p><p>They tell her to sleep, but that can’t be right. First she has to find her son, who is supposed to be here, too. They were separated along the way, overnight, a few days ago. The man who was leading them here divided the group. Twelve people drew too much attention, he claimed. He had sectioned off the women, silencing any protest with the back of his hand, swift to the jaw. “Do you want to get there or not?” They did. “Trust me,” he said.</p><p>He sent a friend to escort them. When she glanced back, she felt a shove between her shoulder blades. “It’s only for a few miles,” he hissed in her ear. “Walk.”</p><p>By morning, the men were gone, the children gone. The friend, a man with sunglasses and a chipped front tooth, said, “I am here to take care of you.” What he meant was that they were there to take care of him. Four women. Which they did. Which they were made to do.</p><p>•</p><p>“Where is my son?” she asks a guard who speaks Spanish. He shrugs in reply. “¿<em>Mi hijo</em>?” she asks anyone who will listen and many who won’t. “He’s five years old. He has black hair, parted on one side, and a freckle, right here, under his eye. He was wearing a Spider-Man shirt.” People just shake their heads.</p><p>“There’s a family unit,” one woman says, pointing down the hall. “They have cribs,” she adds, as if that’s something.</p><p>In the family unit, which is one large room, she searches every crib. She gazes down at infants and eight-year-olds curled against the bars. She scans the faces of the children watching “Dora the Explorer” on a television set mounted to the wall.</p><p>“He’s coming,” a young mother sitting in the corner assures her. She has a child on her lap. “The same thing happened to me. The kids just take longer. They don’t walk as fast. Mine got here a whole week after I did. Everyone makes it eventually.”</p><p>She wants to believe that’s true.</p><p>•</p><p>The first night, she lies in a bed and listens to the noises of the women in the room with her. Dozens of them. They’re stacked neatly in bunk beds, like bodies in a morgue, and she stares at the bowing mattress above her, the straining metal coils, worried that they will not hold. She considers the possibility that the gray-haired woman who clambered up there earlier and who is snoring there now might fall through and crush her to death. She begins to laugh. What if? After everything? What if that’s how it ends? The sound of her laughter blooms in the dark. From across the room, a voice asks, “What the fuck is so funny?”</p><p>•</p><p>They let her store: her clothes, her broken leather sandals, a plastic comb, an elastic hair band. They let her keep: the silver wedding ring she still wears even though her husband died four years ago. They take: her pocketknife (no weapons), a sleeve of Maria cookies (no food), a tin of Vaseline (no reason).</p><p>•</p><p>In the morning, there’s a count. In the evening, there will be another. The guards yank the beige sheet off her bed, balloon it dramatically in the air. “Forty-eighteen, clear!” They move down the line.</p><p>It’s a warehouse, this place: cement floors, fluorescent tube lights in the ceiling, flyers taped to the painted cinder-block walls—ads for phone services, for immigration attorneys, for psychologists. She takes it all in.</p><p>After the inspection, she returns to the processing desk, near the front of the facility. Through the windows she can see a chain-link fence topped with a confection of barbed wire and, just beyond it, an open field speckled with wildflowers and long grass and a few broad trees.</p><p>“My son?” she asks the woman sitting at the desk. “Gabriel Rivas? Did he get here yet?”</p><p>The woman consults her computer. “Sorry,” she says. “No one by that name.”</p><p>She stares at the woman, unsure of what to say.</p><p>“Did you check the family area?” the woman asks.</p><p>•</p><p>They get one hour to eat. Hash browns and syrup for breakfast. Chicken broth and French fries for lunch. Turkey cutlets and potato dumplings for dinner. So many potatoes. It’s a world made of potatoes. There is water to drink, but it tastes like chlorine, and it makes her nauseous.</p><p>They take showers in the trailers. The guards control when the water turns on and when it turns off. Soap bubbles skim across the floor.</p><p>In the bathroom, which is in a separate trailer, she wads up toilet paper and stuffs it into her underwear. A woman next to her notices.</p><p>“Talk to Esme,” she says. “She’ll hook you up.”<span data-page="page_2"></span></p><p>She finds Esme in the dayroom, watching TV. Esme offers to sell her a tampon for a dollar, money she doesn’t have.</p><p>Esme is unsympathetic. She purses her lips. “At least you got your period,” she says. “Many of us don’t, you know, after what they do. We get pregnant instead.”</p><p>•</p><p>She marks the days on her arm. A small dot on the inside of her wrist becomes a trail, then a winding chain.</p><p>•</p><p>Periodically, new people arrive, escorted by border-patrol agents. A few every week. She watches them with their tattered backpacks, the children with stuffed animals in their arms. When the weather turns cold, people are wrapped in foil blankets as they trudge up the walk.</p><p>“Did you see a little boy?” she asks every new arrival. “A boy who looks like me?”</p><p>The people glance at her with weary, red-rimmed eyes. Some of them shake their heads. One after the other, none of them him.</p><p>•</p><p>What if she’s forgotten what he looks like? What if she’s gone crazy? What if he’s here, lying in one of those cribs, and she sees him every single day without realizing he’s her son? What if it’s been too long? What if memory fails? What if everything fails, and getting through life is simply learning to cope with the failure? No, she scolds herself. Don’t think like that. Don’t let yourself give way.</p><p>•</p><p>A woman named Alicia arrives from El Salvador with her six-year-old daughter in tow. They sleep in the bed together. They shower together. The girl won’t leave her mother’s side.</p><p>“She’s nervous,” Alicia says, as if there’s a need to explain. “It was a terrible trip.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“We’re going to find her father in Minnesota.”</p><p>“But this is Texas.”</p><p>“Is it far?”</p><p>And how, she wonders, does she answer a question like that. Is it far? Everything is far from here, even if it’s only across the street.</p><p>•</p><p>She meets with a lawyer, a man in a stained tan sports coat. She asks him how long she’ll be here. She asks him what happens after this. “<em>Eso depende</em>” is his answer to both. Then: “Tell me everything. They’ll need to determine if you qualify for asylum, if you have credible fear.” And though she doesn’t want to relive it, she tells him about the day, a few months ago now, that the boys—boys whose mothers she knew from the neighborhood—pushed her off a moving bus and dragged her across a busy intersection, how she kept scrabbling her legs under her to try to stand, and how they kicked her to keep her down. How nobody helped her, how nobody stopped them because nobody knows how to stop boys like that. How they made her kneel in the alley behind the fruit store while they held a gun to her head and all took turns, how they put the gun in her mouth and made her suck that, too, and how when they were finished they said, “You’re in the family now, bitch,” and laughed.</p><p>“Why do you think they targeted you?” the lawyer asks.</p><p>“I was alone.”</p><p>“You’re not married?”</p><p>“Not anymore.”</p><p>“And you’re pretty.”</p><p>She narrows her eyes.</p><p>“And men—”</p><p>“They were boys.”</p><p>“Even more so. We have an expression here: Boys will be boys.”</p><p>She feels a rising anger.</p><p>“If we go back,” she says evenly, “they will do it again.”</p><p>“We?” he asks. “Is there someone else?”</p><p>“My son,” she starts, but her voice breaks. She clenches her fists. She digs her nails into her palms, determined not to cry.</p><p>•</p><p>At night, lying in her bunk atop the beige sheet, she imagines running back the way she came, retracing her steps through the dirt and the weeds until she finds him standing in the overgrowth somewhere, hungry and cold. She wants to gather him up, to hold him close, to smell the apricot-sweetness of his skin, to feel the fuzz of his ear against her cheek, to say I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry—for what? Had she wanted too much? Safety for herself and for him? Was that too much? It hadn’t seemed like it at the time, but if she hadn’t wanted it they never would have left, and if they had never left she never would have lost him. She wouldn’t have lost everything.</p><p>•</p><p>Often now, she wants to scream. Sometimes she does, and then the guards come to restrain her. They hold her arms behind her back. They drag her down the hall and put her in a room, a colorless box with spiders in the corners, until she calms down. But that’s going in the wrong direction. The scream is for help, not for hindrance. Why don’t they understand? The woman in the box next to hers is there because she threw up. To throw up is to disobey orders. You disobey, you get the box. The guards think: The smaller the box, the more we can control them. But everyone else knows: The smaller the box, the more out of control people become.</p><p>•</p><p>One day, when the air is damp and the sky is mottled and gray, there’s a protest. People outside hold signs that say “<em class="small">ILLEGAL IS A CRIME</em>” and<span data-page="page_final"></span> “<em class="small">SEND THEM BACK WITH BIRTH CONTROL</em>.” People hold American flags over their shoulders like capes. Superhero Americans. She imagines them at home in their living rooms, a bowl of dog food by the door, a cup of cold tea that has steeped too long on the counter. She imagines them laying the poster board on the floor, uncapping markers, drawing the letters, coloring them in.</p><p>•</p><p>Esme lost her baby. She left that part out.</p><p>“She had a miscarriage a few weeks after she got here,” a woman named Marta tells her. “<em>Gracias a Dios</em> that she didn’t have to carry it to term. Her body released its own pain.” Marta stops and shakes her head. “They don’t take care of nobody in here, see. They don’t care who we are. It’s easier to fuck somebody than to give a fuck, you know?”</p><p>•</p><p>One morning, a woman in a pale-pink T-shirt approaches her in the cafeteria while she’s getting a tray.</p><p>“I heard you were looking for your son,” she says quietly.</p><p>She looks at the woman—she can’t help it—with delirious hope.</p><p>“I might know something,” the woman says.</p><p>“Like what?” Her heart pounds. She can hear the echo of it deep in her ears, even amid the clatter and scrape of silverware, the grumble of voices around them.</p><p>“Your ring,” the woman says.</p><p>For a moment, she’s confused, but then she understands. “Tell me,” she says.</p><p>The woman nods at the ring.</p><p>“Tell me first.”</p><p>A smile spreads like an oil slick across the woman’s face, but she doesn’t speak.</p><p>She keeps her eyes on the woman, her round face and her widow’s peak, as she touches the ring on her finger. It’s looser now than when she arrived. She twists it gently and slides it off. She closes her hand around it. When she gives it to the woman, she feels part of herself go numb.</p><p>“Tell me,” she says again.</p><p>The woman fits the ring over the tip of her thumb. “I heard about a boy they found on the side of the road,” she says. “They took him to a hospital in Laredo.”</p><p>“How old?”</p><p>“Ten?”</p><p>She forces herself to swallow. “No,” she says weakly. “My son is younger.”</p><p>“Oh, is he?”</p><p>She nods.</p><p>“Sorry,” the woman says. “I thought maybe it was him.”</p><p>•</p><p>She loses track of the dots. She loses track of herself.</p><p>•</p><p>Alicia and her daughter are released. Marta is sent back. She doesn’t see Esme again.</p><p>And yet. Every day she waits for him by the front door. She sits on the floor, knitting her fingers in her lap.</p><p>And then—</p><p>“Gabriel!”</p><p>She scrambles to her feet. Mixed up in a tangle of people, there he is. His dark, combed hair, the freckle beneath his eye. God in Heaven! It’s him! She lunges forward and wrests him from the crowd. She falls to her knees and pulls him into her arms. She’s so flooded with shock and gratitude that she can hardly breathe. Her nose in his hair, the smell of him almost unbearably sweet. Her hands cupping his shoulders, those same slight shoulders, as small and breakable as eggs. “Gabriel,” she whispers again and again. She can feel him shuddering. “It’s O.K.,” she tells him through tears.</p><p>Around her there is cheering. Or is it shouting? Why is everyone shouting? A woman’s voice saying, “Don’t touch my boy! Mateo!” And why does she feel hands on her now, prying her away, tugging her back as she reaches for him—isn’t it him? isn’t it? but it looked so much like him!—hands that carry her down the hall, hands that shove her into a room, hands that turn the key in the lock.</p><p>She crumples to the floor and blinks in the dark. From inside the box, she screams.</p><p>•</p><p>And then one day there are leaves on the trees, and wild-magnolia blossoms on the branches, bobbing gently in the breeze. She will stay in this place, she tells herself, until he comes. Through the window in the dayroom, she watches the white petals tremble, and, in a gust, a single blossom is torn off a branch. The petals blow apart, swirling, and drift to the ground.</p><p>She closes her eyes. Where has she gone and what has she become? The blisters have healed, the bruises have faded, the evidence has vanished—everything dissolves like sugar in water. It’s easy to let that happen, so much easier to give in, to be who they want you to be: a thing that flares apart in the tumult, a thing that surrenders to the wind. ♦</p>	Cristina Henríquez	July 24, 2017 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/07/24/everything-is-far-from-here	Immigrants	Immigration	Refugees				Unnamed	Third	Immigrants
Foreign-Returned	<p>In Connecticut, Hassan shared a desk with a woman—a girl, really. Later, this would be what he remembered most about the job, long after the inconvenience of his morning commute, the banality of his days spent making spreadsheets, and the mediocrity of the cafeteria had faded from memory. He would remember Hina the way he saw her on her first day. The crunched, focussed expression on her small, sharp face as she claimed her half of the desk, a purse over one arm and a duffelbag over the other, a light sheen of perspiration on her upper lip, a dark-gray head scarf wound tightly around her head and fixed above her right ear with a long, silver pin.</p><p>Hina nodded at Hassan in greeting and then took a brass-colored nameplate out of her purse, placing it carefully on her side of the desk. It was the kind of thing you might order from a mall kiosk that specialized in monogrammed gifts.</p><p>“My name is Hina Bhati,” she said, pointing at the nameplate, in case he hadn’t noticed it.</p><p>“Yes, I see that,” Hassan said.</p><p>Hassan had been at the bank eight weeks. Long enough to know that there was a slow way he could take from the men’s room back to his cubicle, a route that killed off three minutes of the work day. Long enough to learn that casual Fridays meant khakis, not jeans. Long enough to feel that the two-person, T-shaped desk he’d been assigned to was his alone. Hina Bhati looked to be in her early twenties, at least seven or eight years younger than he was. Why on earth were they sharing a desk?</p><p>Hina had an accounting degree from <em class="small">SUNY</em> Albany, a fact that he learned from the diploma she hung on the wall next to her computer, tapping a tiny nail into the plaster with a miniature, purse-size hammer. On her desk she arranged a tissue box with a crocheted cover, a small, iridescent vase with three silk flowers, and a sturdy, expensive-looking ballpoint pen. She put several large computer manuals on the floor and stood on top of them in order to reach the high shelf above her desk. There she placed her Quran, swaddled in a maroon velvet cover and decorated with multicolored ribbons. Once her belongings were in order, she tucked an imaginary hair inside her scarf and raised the height of her chair until her feet didn’t touch the floor. Hassan noticed that she swung her heels back and forth as she talked, as a child might.</p><p>“So,” she began, fixing him with a flat stare, “we might as well get to know each other. Where are you from and how long have you been at the bank?”</p><p>He could guess from Hina’s accent that she had grown up in the States, and from her features, her coloring, and her name that she was likely Pakistani. Was this, he wondered, why they had been assigned the same desk? The two Pakistanis? The thought irked him. He could already tell how little they had in common.</p><p>Working in Stamford hadn’t been part of Hassan’s original plan. When he first came to the U.S., he had worked as a senior analyst at Citigroup in New York, a job he had held for seven months before being laid off, after which he’d had to scramble to get a new position before the grace period on his H-1B ran out. In a few months, the Americans would elect a new President, and the news was filled with talk of Muslims—which ones you could trust, which ones should be registered or accounted for. He felt lucky to have found the position in Stamford, even though it had meant a pay cut and a relocation. He didn’t mention any of this to Hina. Instead, he told her that he and his wife, Sara, were originally from Karachi and loved the peace and quiet they had found in Connecticut.</p><p>Hina told him that she was from Albany but her parents were from Gujranwala, Pakistan. She had travelled to her ancestral home only once, as a teen-ager. Gujranwala struck Hassan as the kind of second-tier industrial city you visited only if you had a specific reason. He had gone there once for a cricket match with his college team. “What did you think of it?” Hassan asked, amused at the thought of Hina attempting to navigate Gujranwala’s crowded streets. She seemed to shiver slightly at the memory, as if trying to shake off the dust even now.</p><p>“It made me grateful to have grown up in America,” she said.</p><p>“You should visit Karachi sometime,” Hassan said. “I think you’d enjoy it.”</p><p>“That doesn’t seem likely,” Hina said, crinkling up her nose. “The State Department has a Travel Warning for Pakistan now. My father says that we’re much better off here.”</p><p>She reached under the desk and pulled a prayer rug from her duffelbag. She explained that she had arranged with Tom, their team leader, to offer her daily prayers in the conference room on the eleventh floor. “Where do you keep your rug?” she asked.</p><p>Hassan shrugged. “I don’t,” he said. “I mean, not here.” Back home, his religious practice had been limited to an annual trip to the masjid for Eid, but it hardly seemed necessary to explain<span data-page="page_2"></span> this to Hina. Prayer was a personal matter, in his opinion. Best avoided in the workplace.</p><p>Hassan and Sara lived just outside Stamford in a two-bedroom apartment with wall-to-wall carpeting and a faintly musty smell. Of all the places they’d looked at, this had been the closest to Hassan’s office. It cost about half what they’d been paying in Murray Hill, but there was little else to recommend it. The modern furniture they’d bought in New York was all wrong here. Tall, decorative vases that had once flanked their entryway now huddled like conspirators in the hall. When Sara talked about returning to Manhattan, Hassan nodded. He had a one-year contract at RBS, and he knew he’d be lucky to extend it. It was unlikely that they’d move back to the city anytime soon. But he didn’t want to upset her. In New York, there had been places for Sara to walk to, to explore. In Stamford, the only place she could reach on foot was a small, deserted park. He figured that once she got pregnant she would spend her time turning the second bedroom into a nursery. But that hadn’t happened yet. Sometimes it just took a while, the doctor had said. Keep trying; come back in a few months. Hassan didn’t tell Sara that every time she got her period he felt a small, tugging sense of relief.</p><p>Most evenings, Hassan returned from work to find Sara in their bedroom, riding her exercise bike and watching CNN. Even in the sweatpants and baggy T-shirts she wore in the apartment, even in her glasses, even fifteen pounds heavier than she had been on their wedding day, three years ago, Sara was still a beautiful woman. She had been the most sought-after girl of his youth. True, this was perhaps not the America she had signed up for. But it was still America.</p><p>“What have you been up to today?” Hassan asked, retrieving an empty coffee mug from the floor. Around Sara’s bike was a sea of miscellany: piles of papers, coasters, binders, souvenir mugs, tangled Christmas lights.</p><p>“Unpacking,” Sara said, her eyes glassy, focussed on the television. Hassan found the election coverage repetitive and tiresome—these windbag candidates were just like the ones back home, he argued—but Sara had become fixated. Instead of looking into grad school, she spent her days tracking every scandal, every erroneous theory, even though she couldn’t vote.</p><p>At the beginning of her second week in the office, Hina suggested that she and Hassan review each other’s work for errors, sharing files back and forth, before forwarding them to Tom. They were working on a prospective buyout, a deal to purchase a toll road in Indiana. Some days Tom had them running financial models; other days he had them prepare his presentations for weekly meetings. Hassan was annoyed that, apart from a group e-mail chain, he and Hina had almost no contact with the other analysts working on the deal. But Hina didn’t mind. She told Hassan that she liked to think of herself as Tom’s secret weapon.</p><p>“Well, he has two secret weapons, then,” Hassan suggested. “Me and you.”</p><p>“Perhaps,” Hina said, as if she didn’t quite agree.</p><p>Hassan made occasional mistakes and Hina caught them. But Hina’s work was meticulous. And she was fast.</p><p>“Watch out, Hassan! She’s unstoppable!” Tom said as he passed their desk, chuckling to himself.</p><p>Tom’s compliments made Hina blush and squirm with pleasure. “Don’t worry,” she told Hassan one afternoon. “I know you’re concerned that I’m smarter and faster than you, but that’s not it.”</p><p>“That’s not what?” Hassan asked, bristling. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“Well, it’s just that I have greater attention to detail, that’s all,” Hina said. “It may be because of the way that I was taught in school. Instead of using rote memorization, we were taught cognitive problem solving. My father says that’s the real advantage of an American education.”</p><p>It was difficult not to snap at Hina when she said things like this. Hassan tried to compose a witty response, but he couldn’t come up with anything fast enough. He excused himself and walked to the kitchen to get some coffee. From that point onward, Hassan forwarded Hina’s work to Tom without checking it, spending the time he’d saved following cricket matches on his smartphone.</p><p>That evening over dinner, Hassan did his best impression of Hina for Sara.</p><p>“You see, that’s why <em>American</em> Pakistanis like <em>me</em> are superior to <em>Pakistani</em> Pakistanis like <em>you</em>,” he said, making his eyes wide and his voice high. He put a dinner napkin on his head to simulate Hina’s headscarf, making Sara laugh.</p><p>“But there must be something interesting or valuable about her, Hassan,” Sara said. “Otherwise, how did she get the job?”</p><p>Hassan said that no, Hina was deathly boring. She was a typical American hijabi. All high and mighty.</p><p>Every Sunday that summer, Sara and Hassan put on their best weekend clothes—bright blouses and capri pants for her, polo shirts and pressed khakis for him—and went to the Ahmeds’ house, in Darien. Mona and Ali Ahmed were originally from Lahore, friends of friends back home. They had the assurance of people who had spent two comfortable decades on the East Coast: a wide circle of acquaintances, membership at a local golf club, a time-share in Naples, Florida. Ali Ahmed was a pediatric gastroenterologist.<span data-page="page_3"></span> Mona organized charity events for the Islamic Center in Stamford. Every weekend, they hosted an open house, a back-yard party where Pakistani families dropped by with their kids and ate lunch by the pool.</p><p>The Ahmeds’ house was a big white Colonial with green shutters, framed by carefully landscaped shrubs and trees. There was a semicircular driveway and a four-car garage with a guest apartment above it. “<em>This</em> is what I imagined Connecticut would look like,” Sara said the first time they drove up to the house, her eyes opening wider with admiration. Hassan instinctively tried to find fault with the house. He knew that it might be years, a decade even, before they could afford a place like this. But it <em>was</em> grand, Hassan had to admit. Like a house in a movie about a family with a lovable dog.</p><p>The Ahmeds’ three sons—seven, nine, and twelve—were always dressed in matching outfits, their hair combed and gelled to one side. The boys were consistently charming and well behaved, salaaming each guest on arrival and shaking hands, then promptly disappearing to play on their own. “Those kids are so impressive,” Sara murmured. “I don’t know how Mona does it.”</p><p>The female guests each contributed a dish covered in plastic wrap—fresh shami kebabs, fruit salad, homemade samosas—which they took to the kitchen when they arrived so that they could gossip with Mona. Sara told Hassan that, as the ladies unwrapped the dishes, Mona made each one feel as if she alone were the most important woman at the party. She touched their sleeves. She complimented them on their haircuts. Sara admired Mona—her impeccable taste, how quickly she connected with other women—but she also sensed that the parties were a kind of audition. For what, she told Hassan, she wasn’t sure.</p><p>Outside in the yard, the husbands hovered around a large Weber grill, keeping Ali company while he grilled chicken tikkas. Funny, wasn’t it, Hassan had remarked to Sara after their first visit, how in America these men were so proud of their barbecuing skills, a task none of them would have taken on back home. But Hassan looked up to Ali. The easy way he interacted with his guests, his salt-and-pepper hair always in place. Hassan noticed that Ali rarely offered his own opinions, instead encouraging other people to talk about themselves. People said that he was an excellent doctor.</p><p>On the fourth Sunday in June, Ali clapped Hassan on the back and passed him the grill tongs. “H-man,” he said, “you think you can take care of this while I go for a swim?”</p><p>“Definitely,” Hassan said, smiling. He turned to the grill, squeezing the points of the tongs together in one hand and staring at a platter of raw chicken legs. He wished that he hadn’t been the one tapped for this task. He had never cooked anything more elaborate than a fried egg.</p><p>Abid, a heavyset banker in his late forties, sat drinking a beer next to the grill, watching Hassan with interest. “You should see the look on your face, bro. You’d think he just asked you to deliver a baby. You want me to do it for you?”</p><p>“No, I got it, thanks,” Hassan said, waving the smoke away from his eyes.</p><p>“What did you say you do at RBS, by the way?” Abid asked, pulling his seat closer and offering Hassan a drink from the cooler.</p><p>Hassan described the buyout that he and Hina were working on, trying to sound knowledgeable about infrastructure in Indiana. He hoped that Abid would assume he was higher up in the pecking order of his group than he really was. The trouble was that he found it difficult, while explaining his job and drinking a beer, to stay focussed on the chicken. How was he supposed to know when the meat was done?</p><p>When lunch was served it was clear that much of the chicken was burned on the outside and raw in the middle. Ali told Hassan not to worry. He placed the most undercooked pieces back on the grill, covering them with the lid, and urged the guests to go ahead and start eating the rest of the meal. Mona looked annoyed.</p><p>“Dude, Hassan’s trying to kill us,” Abid joked.</p><p>Hassan glared at him. Sara kicked Hassan’s shin under the table. Hassan bit into a drumstick that was clearly too pink near the bone.</p><p>“You’ll get sick, sweetheart,” Sara said to him under her breath, passing him a napkin. “Don’t eat that.”</p><p>“It’s fine, don’t be silly,” Hassan said, tearing off a piece of raw chicken with his teeth. “Not bad at all.”</p><p>Sundays gave Hassan and Sara a sense that Connecticut held possibility, that they were on a trajectory. True, Ali and Mona inhabited entire worlds that Hassan and Sara never entered. The club where Ali played golf with other doctors, for one. The Islamic Center, where Mona did her volunteering, a place that held little interest for either of them. But at the pool parties Hassan and Sara felt a sense of rightness. On Sundays, they felt closest to the people they wanted to be.</p><p>There was never a possibility that Hassan and Sara could reciprocate the Ahmeds’ hospitality. The thought of inviting the Ahmeds over to their small, shabby apartment felt ludicrous. And so each Sunday they chatted with Ali<span data-page="page_4"></span> and Mona and the other guests for a few moments of real connection, and went home feeling unsatisfied.</p><p>Until one Sunday in August, when Sara told a lie.</p><p>Hassan could tell that she hadn’t planned to do it. After lunch, Mona asked her about their current living situation, what they would do when they had a baby, if they’d need to move to a bigger place. Sara mentioned that they were living in a two-bedroom apartment near the office, and Hassan saw Mona frown slightly. But, Sara added quickly, they had their eye on a four-bedroom Victorian in Newfield. They had recently put in an offer on the place, she continued, but then the owner had backed out of the sale. His adult daughter thought she might want the house after all.</p><p>“That must be so frustrating,” Mona said, fixing her large, kohl-rimmed eyes on Sara with sympathy. “And what do you think about all this, Hassan?”</p><p>“Right, yes,” Hassan murmured, faltering. “I mean, yes, it’s annoying.”</p><p>“Oh, we’ll find something else,” Sara said, her voice confident, pulling Mona’s attention back to her. “I know just what I want.”</p><p>Hassan watched Sara conjure up a house with her elegant, long-fingered hands. She used words that he didn’t know she knew. Cornice. Eave. Gable. He saw Mona looking at Sara, smiling at her more. At the end of the day, Mona handed her a tote bag full of paint chips and fabric swatches left over from her most recent redecoration, pointing to the sage greens and dove grays that she liked best.</p><p>On the drive back to their apartment, Sara examined the samples, rubbing the soft fabrics between her thumb and forefinger. She said the names of the paint colors aloud: Misty Morning Dew. Sandy Ridge. Brookside Moss. Hassan chose his words carefully. He didn’t want to upset his wife, but as he spoke he found irritation creeping into his voice. Now, he said, they’d have to talk about their imaginary house hunt every Sunday. Yes, of course he wanted those things, too. But Sara’s lie had made him feel foolish. He was only a few months into his contract. They were a far cry away from a four-bedroom Victorian.</p><p>Sara looked out the window, the stack of binders open in her lap.</p><p>“Oh, I know all that,” she said.</p><p>“Then why?” Hassan asked. “Why did you say those things?”</p><p>“Because,” Sara said, her voice becoming small, “I can tell what she thinks of us.”</p><p>“What does she think of us?” Hassan asked, surprised to find that he cared.</p><p>“She thinks we’re . . . ordinary,” Sara said.</p><p>Hassan started to interject: What was wrong, he wanted to argue, with being ordinary? With fitting in? But then he stopped himself. In Karachi, Hassan and Sara had grown up in their grandfathers’ houses. Their families had histories that were understood by their friends, shared by their neighbors. In Connecticut, they were interchangeable. Inconsequential. He was just another analyst. She was just another wife.</p><p>Their friendship with the Ahmeds lasted the twelve weeks of summer. Then, on Labor Day, while they were eating lunch, Mona informed Hassan and Sara that she wouldn’t be having the weekly pool party anymore. Now that the school year was starting, she planned to host a multicultural book club instead. Each week, the group would read a book from a different culture and discuss it over lunch.</p><p>“There will be two Irish: they are called the Foleys. A Jewish surgeon and his wife. A Korean and some South Indians.”</p><p>“Sara and I could be the Pakistanis,” Hassan suggested, smiling.</p><p>“Oh, but I’m afraid that’s us,” Mona said, shaking her head with sympathy. “Ali and I are the Pakistanis in the group.”</p><p>Without the weekly trips to Darien, Hassan and Sara’s routine felt unevenly weighted, off-kilter. They spent Sundays at the Stamford Town Center mall, looking at kitchen appliances and clothes that they didn’t need. They went out for Chinese food. They drank flavored lattes. They took a scenic drive to look at fall leaves.</p><p>“What’s all the fuss about?” Hassan asked, squinting out the window as Sara drove north on I-95. “I mean, they’re leaves.”</p><p>Every morning, Hassan watched Sara take her temperature and enter the data into an app on her phone. She made fertility charts, looking for fluctuations and patterns. She spent hours exchanging anonymous messages with other women trying to conceive. But still no baby.</p><p>One Monday morning in October, Hina came to work with new pins on her parka. She explained to Hassan that she had spent the weekend canvassing in Pennsylvania with her women’s group. She had a serious look on her face, and Hassan wondered, with a vague sense of dread, if she planned to give him a lecture on the virtues of American democracy. He was surprised when she asked if she could tell him about her trip.</p><p>“I know we’re not . . . friends,” Hina said, taking her seat and folding her hands in her lap. “But I feel very distracted by what happened. Perhaps if I talk about it I can put it out of my mind.”</p><p>“Be my guest,” Hassan said, closing his browser, his interest piqued.</p><p>Hina described her trip. She explained how her group had started the day registering new voters at a shopping center. Then the group had broken into pairs. Hina<span data-page="page_5"></span> and another girl, Saima, were given a list of names and addresses of registered Democrats in a residential neighborhood about five miles from the mall. There, they went door to door. It was the middle of the afternoon and most people weren’t home. The neighborhood looked very much like the one in which Hina had grown up. There were ranch homes. Minivans in the driveways. American flags. It felt familiar.</p><p>After they had covered a few blocks, a large white sedan passed the girls and then circled back, pulling up alongside them. There were three boys in the car. They were wearing basketball jerseys. Were they lost? one of them asked. Did they need directions? Hina thanked the young man and explained that they were spending the afternoon canvassing, talking to registered Democrats. Were they registered to vote? she asked. Did they live in the area? The boy in the passenger seat was the talker of the group. His light hair was shaved on the sides and spiked on top. They were from this neighborhood, he said. They were all registered to vote. They would love to talk further with Hina and her friend. Why not get in the car and they could go for a drive? Then they could talk more comfortably.</p><p>Hina said that they’d be happy to discuss the issues right where they were. The blond boy persisted, asking if the girls couldn’t get in the car because it was against their religion? No, it wasn’t like that, Hina explained. It was just that they had work to do. Did they not trust him? the young man wanted to know. Hadn’t he been friendly to them, even though he supported the other candidate? Yes, he had been friendly, Hina said. Then they should shake hands, he said. They should shake hands as a gesture of friendship. To show that they could agree to disagree. The boy offered Hina his hand.</p><p>Hina took the boy’s hand and he grinned at her. Just then his friend tapped the accelerator and the car lurched forward. She could hear the boys laughing as she stumbled. She shouted at the boy to let her hand go, but he held on. Then the car moved again. Her arm snapped back as she fell, landing on the pavement with a thud. She heard Saima shouting at the receding car. Hina lay on the ground, staring at the sky. Her arm felt sore, but it was nothing, really—she was more startled than injured. What bothered her was that she had touched that boy. She hated the fact that she had fallen for the prank. Once she had calmed down, she and Saima went to the local police station.</p><p>“What did the police say?” Hassan asked, leaning across the desk. He made an effort to look unaffected, but he felt furious on Hina’s behalf.</p><p>“The officer said that if he had a dollar for every time someone behaved badly he’d be rich. That was it. It’s just—” Hina’s voice broke. She cleared her throat. “It’s just that I wish I had told those guys to go fuck themselves.”</p><p>Hassan had never heard Hina swear. He watched her switch on her monitor and open her purse, remove her phone, her notebook, and her pen, and place them in a neat row next to her keyboard. Hassan could see that telling him her story had made Hina feel more in control. But it left him agitated. For the rest of the day, he found himself looking over at Hina, studying her small, round shoulders. He had spent his entire life in Pakistan as part of the majority. What would it feel like, he wondered, to consider America home?</p><p>In November, Hassan and Sara found themselves trying to explain the election results to their families in Karachi. Yes, they said, it was true that a handful of states had the power to determine the winner. Yes, a candidate could win the most votes and still not become President. In that case, Hassan’s mother said, the Americans were even more foolish than she’d thought. At least in Pakistan, she said, they hadn’t chosen their own dictators.</p><p>One afternoon, Hassan toggled between numbers in a spreadsheet and bullets and graphs on a presentation, unsure of what to work on next. The hours between lunch and dinner stretched out in front of him like an interminable sentence. On the other side of the desk, Hina looked deeply engrossed in her work, her face inches from her monitor. She was reading traffic studies, prepping for a meeting in which she’d most likely not even be called on. This was the difference, he realized, between Sara and Hina. Sara would talk about graduate school for another year and probably not do anything about it. Hina would have been halfway to a degree by now.</p><p>“You have exciting plans for Thanksgiving, Hina?” Hassan asked. He assumed she’d be heading back to Albany. The dutiful daughter.</p><p>Hina didn’t look up from her monitor. “Well, my friend Mona Ahmed wants me to join her family in Florida, but I’m not sure if I will or not,” she said.</p><p>Hearing the name spoken aloud gave Hassan an odd feeling in his stomach. “How do you know Mona?” he asked.</p><p>“From the Islamic Center,” Hina explained. “She’s been very kind to me. And I’m fond of her children.”<span data-page="page_6"></span> Hassan suddenly couldn’t stand those Ahmed brats. Their precious matching shirts and haircuts.</p><p>“You babysit for them?” Hassan asked.</p><p>“No,” Hina said, drawing herself upright in her chair. “We’re friends. Mona and I are in the same women’s group. We went canvassing together. And I’m in her multicultural book club.”</p><p>That evening, Hassan told Sara what he’d learned.</p><p>“How could you not realize that she’s known them all this time?” she asked, exasperated. She was sitting on the floor of their bedroom folding laundry, stacking socks and underwear into little piles. “You sit across from her <em>all day</em>.”</p><p>“It’s not as if we compare social calendars,” Hassan said. He sat down on their bed, looking at the mound of laundry. But he had wondered the same thing. How could he not have known?</p><p>A week later, Hassan got home from work to find that Sara had set the table with crystal wineglasses, yellow supermarket roses, and cloth napkins. She was wearing a long diaphanous tunic over slim pants, her hair blow-dried straight and her eyes painted a dark, smoky blue. Hassan hadn’t seen her dressed this way in ages.</p><p>“You didn’t need to go to all this trouble,” he said, gesturing around at the clean apartment. “I mean, it’s only Hina.” He had resisted the idea of inviting her, but Sara had insisted on it.</p><p>“Don’t be silly,” Sara said. “We have to be hospitable.”</p><p>In the dim light of their apartment, Hina seemed softer. Instead of the boxy jackets and long skirts she wore to work, she had come dressed in a maroon shalwar kameez and a matching headscarf. Her outfit looked freshly ironed.</p><p>“Such a pleasure to meet you, finally!” Sara said, kissing Hina on both cheeks and showing her to the couch.</p><p>Hassan asked Hina if she’d read the latest report on a toll-road project about to be scrapped by lawmakers in Texas. “Might be something we should be aware of,” he said, calling up the article on his phone so that he could read it aloud.</p><p>“Hassan,” Sara said, rolling her eyes for Hina’s benefit and handing her a glass of fresh orange juice, “don’t be a bore. I want to hear about Hina’s family.”</p><p>Hina rested the glass in her lap and smiled cautiously at Sara. Her father, she told them, had come from the Punjab with the help of his older brother. He had settled first in Michigan, then in upstate New York. Hina had three younger sisters and one brother. She was the first college graduate in her family.</p><p>“Isn’t that lovely,” Sara said, turning to Hassan.</p><p>He nodded, his smile tight. It was slightly embarrassing, watching Sara try to ingratiate herself with Hina.</p><p>“And Hassan tells me you know Mona and Ali Ahmed?” Sara said.</p><p>“Yes,” Hina said. “Mona has been a mentor to me.”</p><p>“Isn’t that wonderful. Mona is a dear friend.”</p><p>“I didn’t realize that,” Hina said.</p><p>“Well, we’ve been so busy this fall,” Sara said. “That’s probably why we haven’t seen you at the Ahmeds.”</p><p>“Of course,” Hina said.</p><p>Sara excused herself to finish preparing the meal and Hassan turned on their large flat-screen TV, taking a seat next to Hina. It was strange, he realized, that he had sat across from Hina all these months but had never sat beside her. They were only a few inches apart on the couch. He could smell her scent, something musky and floral and not altogether unpleasant.</p><p>At the dinner table, Hina took a portion of vegetables and salad but didn’t touch the main course, a thick rib-eye steak.</p><p>“Have some steak, Hina,” Sara said, holding out a piece toward Hina’s plate. “It’s a very good cut.” Hassan knew that the meat had been expensive, the most impressive American dish that Sara could think of.</p><p>“Thank you, but I only eat halal,” Hina said, piercing a roasted potato with her fork and chewing it methodically.</p><p>Hassan worried for a moment that Sara might try to pass the meat off as halal, when he knew that she’d bought it at the Fairway Market in Stamford, where she bought all their food.</p><p>Sara paused, frowning slightly, and then slid half the steak onto her own plate, more than she could possibly eat, passing the rest to Hassan.</p><p>“Hina,” Sara said, adopting a serious face, “Tell me more about your women’s group. I’m really looking to deepen my faith.”</p><p>In early December, an invitation arrived in Hassan’s inbox. The Ahmeds were having a holiday party at their home, an open house from 4 to 8 <em class="small">P.M</em>. He clicked on the invitation twice, watching the shiny snowflakes and fat metallic orbs rotate. Were they back on the Ahmeds’ official guest list? Or was this a test?</p><p>Hassan was curious if Hina had received the same invitation.</p><p>“I’m not sure if I’m going yet,” she said. “I mean, I like the Ahmeds a lot, but they serve alcohol at their parties and that bothers me.”</p><p>“What’s the big deal?” Hassan asked. “I mean, it’s not like anyone is forcing you to drink it.”</p><p>“I don’t think you understand,” Hina said, tipping her head to one side and giving him a long look.</p><p>“Understand what?” Hassan asked.</p><p>“What it means to stick to your principles,” Hina said.</p><p>The exterior of the Ahmeds’ house was decorated with small white lights, a bright constellation of<span data-page="page_7"></span> electric points that gave the place a kind of glow. Inside there were real pine boughs that let off a fresh, wintry smell. There was food piled on every table—selections of fresh cookies dusted in powdered sugar and platters of crackers, cheese, and fruit. In the dining room, Hassan spotted Hina and waved to her. She was more dressed up than he’d seen her before, in a long, emerald-green shalwar kameez and matching headscarf. What’s more, he whispered to Sara, there was something different about her face. “That’s called makeup, Hassan,” Sara said, refilling her wineglass. “Who knows? Maybe she’s getting set up with someone tonight.”</p><p>Sara went to the kitchen to find Mona, and Hassan went in search of Ali. He found him in the library, a small, wood-panelled room thick with cigar smoke. A group of men were in the midst of what looked like an animated discussion. On the coffee table was a large bottle of Johnnie Walker Black Label, a monogrammed, leather-covered ice bucket, and several crystal tumblers. Ali seemed pleased to see him, as if no time had elapsed since the summer. “Help yourself, Hassan,” he said, waving him in and telling him to shut the door behind him. Hassan grabbed a glass from the tray and settled into a leather chair. He nodded to Abid, who nodded back.</p><p>“Look, there’s no question,” Abid said to the group. “This Administration will be good for business.” Several of the others speculated on how their investment portfolios might be positively affected by fewer regulations. Hassan began to feel nervous that Ali or Abid or one of the other men might ask him about his own investments. He had none. Not yet.</p><p>Several of the men had gone to school together in Lahore. Others had known each other at Boston University. There were jokes that Hassan didn’t understand, references to Web sites that he didn’t read. He didn’t have much to contribute to the conversation. He drank four Scotches in a row. When he stood up, he realized that he was drunk.</p><p>Hassan excused himself and weaved through rooms of people, looking for Sara. Where was she? Suddenly he found himself wondering what he was doing here. Who were all these people?</p><p>He couldn’t find Sara, but he spotted Hina through a doorway. She sat wedged on a couch between two older Pakistani women, who were laughing. Hina looked miserable, as if she had gone along with a joke that she now regretted.</p><p>“Come on, Hina,” Hassan heard one of the women say. “I want to introduce you to my nephew in London. Just take it off so I can snap your picture and send it to him. I won’t post it anywhere, I promise.”</p><p>“You’d be quite pretty without the scarf,” the other woman said.</p><p>He made his way to the kitchen, where Sara was huddled with Mona by the stove.</p><p>“Sweetheart!” Sara said, extending one hand in the air like a punctuation mark. The Scotch made him feel as if the party were moving in slow motion. “Mona and I are getting caught up. I’m telling her about how we had to fire the contractor on our new place and move into a temporary apartment. . . .”</p><p>Hassan could see that Sara’s eyes were bright with her lies, that she was trying to give him a message to play along. Walking toward her, he felt something bubbling up inside him, a well of anger about to erupt. Just once, he thought, just once he should say out loud that his wife was full of shit.</p><p>“Sara,” he began, “we both know . . .” His finger was pointed at her as if they were in a schoolyard, but now he hesitated, stumbling to find his words. He saw the whiteness of Sara’s eyes around her pupils, her stare suddenly narrowed and mean. His wife could be frightening when she wanted to be.</p><p>Just then, he heard someone lurch into the room, and he turned to see Hina standing in the doorway, her bulky parka bunched under one arm.</p><p>“Mona, I’m sorry, but I have to go home,” she announced. “I feel sick and I have to go home. Right now.”</p><p>Mona went to Hina and put an arm around her shoulder.</p><p>“Wouldn’t you rather sleep over?” she asked kindly. “It’s raining now. You can take the yellow guest room. I can lend you a nightgown.”</p><p>“Yes, that’s a good idea, Hina,” Sara added in a soothing tone of voice, joining Mona. “Let us take care of you.”</p><p>But Hina said that she would prefer to sleep in her own bed. She had already called a cab. She pulled her parka on over her outfit and walked toward the front door.</p><p>“Hassan, you’ll go with Hina, yes,” Mona asked, a directive instead of a question. She handed him a large golf umbrella from a stand near the back door. “Make sure she gets home all right.”</p><p>Sara stood next to Mona like a sentinel. “Go, sweetheart,” she said. “Be a gentleman and don’t trouble yourself with anything here.” She smiled at him, an old smile that told him that she would fix things with the Ahmeds, she would fix things in Connecticut, she would forget what he had almost said. All that he was required to do was deliver Hina home safely.<span data-page="page_8"></span></p><p>Outside, Hina stood facing the driveway, trying to take shelter underneath a pine tree, shielding herself from what had become sleeting rain. Hassan joined her there, offering her part of the dry space under the umbrella.</p><p>“They said the cab would be ten minutes, but that was twenty minutes ago,” she said, sounding very small. “I feel like I might throw up. I should never have let those women take my picture.”</p><p>“I can drop you,” Hassan said. “Mona asked me to drop you.”</p><p>“No,” Hina said, refusing to look at him. “You’ve been drinking and I don’t want to get in your car.”</p><p>It was not an unreasonable point, actually. He probably shouldn’t drive.</p><p>When the cab arrived, Hassan got in after Hina. “I’ll make sure you get home O.K.,” he said.</p><p>Hina pulled up a map on her phone and gave directions to the driver, then she leaned her head against the window, her shoulders slumped. When they arrived at her building, Hina handed the driver two twenty-dollar bills and got out of the cab quickly, waving goodnight and not waiting for her change.</p><p>As she walked up her front steps, Hassan noticed her chunky black purse, forgotten on the seat next to him. He grabbed it and scrambled out of the cab.</p><p>“Hina,” he called out, waving the purse in his right hand.</p><p>The cab took off, and Hassan ran after the car, slipping in the slush, but the driver didn’t stop. Hassan walked back to Hina’s doorstep, panting with the effort.</p><p>“Your purse,” he said, holding it out to her. She took it, looking grateful.</p><p>“You can come up and call another cab if you want,” she said. “It’s pretty cold out.”</p><p>As they walked up the long, narrow staircase to her apartment Hassan was conscious of the silence. It felt strangely intimate to watch Hina put her key in the lock and push the door open, to step into the personal space where she slept and ate. It had been a long time since he’d been invited into a woman’s apartment alone.</p><p>The apartment was dark. The street lamps outside lit the edges of the room, and Hassan looked around, trying to find an object to focus on.</p><p>On one wall of the living room hung what looked like a velveteen poster of the Kaaba at Mecca; on the other was a Matisse landscape mounted on foam board.</p><p>Hina began to breathe deeply, her shoulders rising and falling with the effort. Hassan wondered if she was crying. Then she stepped over to him, looking up. She was standing less than a foot from Hassan, the toes of her boots nearly touching his.</p><p>“My parents wanted me to be educated. To be like <em>educated Pakistanis</em>,” she said, her voice a low hiss. “But I see you, and you’re all so confused and selfish. None of you are any better than my father.”</p><p>Hina put a hand over her mouth and stifled an awkward sound, something between a cry and a moan. In the darkness of the room, he could just make out the whites of her eyes in the light from the street. Hina was right, he thought. All the people at the party were hypocrites. Including his wife.</p><p>Hina reached up with her left hand and pulled out the long pin that kept her headscarf fastened. With her right, she tugged on the cloth, letting it fall to her shoulders. Her hair was cut in layers around her face and her eyes looked large.</p><p>As she straightened her shoulders and held his gaze, Hassan felt two thoughts compete for his attention: one, that he should excuse himself and go home immediately, and the other, that he couldn’t leave, that he was somehow rooted to the floor. Hassan and Hina stood there facing each other for what felt like minutes. A car pulled up outside and he could hear a man and a woman laughing, snatches of music playing through the car window. Hina stood still, the pin in her hand. For a brief, terrible moment, Hassan wondered if she was going to do something with it. He felt the thud of his heart in his ears, as if he’d been running. Then she turned abruptly and disappeared behind a door. He heard the sound of water in the bathroom.</p><p>Before he could imagine any other possibility, Hassan hurried down the stairs. The streets were empty, the only sound a garbage truck doing its nightly rounds. Thank God, he repeated to himself as he walked. Thank God he hadn’t done anything stupid.</p><p>At work on Monday, Hina’s face was tight, her lips a thin line. Hassan slid a cup of coffee and a doughnut across the desk.</p><p>“I didn’t know which kind you like,” he said, “so I got glazed. I hope that’s all right.”</p><p>Hina reached for the coffee and took a small sip. “Thank you,” she said.</p><p>“Did you recover O.K. from the party?” Hassan asked. It seemed awkward not to acknowledge the strangeness of the evening, the abruptness of the way they had parted, but Hina winced.</p><p>“I behaved wrongly,” she said. “I shouldn’t have been around people who were drinking. I shouldn’t have been alone with you in my apartment. And I shouldn’t have removed my headscarf.”</p><p>“But nothing happened,” Hassan said, leaning forward in his chair. “Hina, we didn’t<span data-page="page_final"></span> <em>do</em> anything.”</p><p>“But we could have,” she said, turning toward the wall, as if she couldn’t bear to look at his face. “That’s the problem.”</p><p>Then a curious thing happened. Something that he could not have predicted. Hina pulled her chair closer and laid her palms flat on the top of the desk. She began to speak in a low, even tone that couldn’t be overheard if one of their co-workers walked by. She told him about her childhood in Albany. About how, when her three younger sisters and brother were small, it was Hina who took care of them while her father finished the night shift in his store and her mother worked at the hospital. Every evening, she braided her sisters’ hair and every morning she made an assembly line of omelettes, dicing green chilies and onions and tomatoes. Hina was shy at school and didn’t make friends easily. At home, she liked to pretend that the children were hers, to raise as she liked.</p><p>Then, shortly after her twentieth birthday, her father told her that some family friends from Delaware were coming to meet her. It was obvious to Hina what this meant. Her prospective husband was well dressed, deferential to her parents, inquisitive about her interests. He was ten years older than she was, an estate lawyer with teeth so bright she wondered if he’d had them whitened. When they were given time alone to talk, she watched him drink his tea and tried to imagine a life with him. She tried to picture sleeping next to him, having his child. There was nothing wrong with him, and yet she couldn’t shake the fact that he was not what she wanted.</p><p>“When I refused him,” Hina said, “my parents and I stopped speaking to one another. They said that I had embarrassed them. That I was throwing away the best chance I’d get. I moved into a campus apartment with two girls I knew from the Muslim Students Association. I finished my degree in two years.” Hina crossed her arms, looking almost defiant. “I send my parents money occasionally. Through my sister. I want them to be comfortable. But the truth is that I have not seen them in five years. <em>Inshallah</em>, my contract here will be extended next summer,” she added. “I want to make senior analyst by the time I’m twenty-five. Then go for my M.B.A. After that, I’ll be on track to make V.P. and buy a house. Then my siblings can come and live with me. I’m not interested in marriage. I want to make a life that I choose.”</p><p>Hina sat back, smoothing her scarf and looking calmer. Hassan had always been aware that he might lack the qualities essential for success in America, but it had never seemed as evident to him as it did now.</p><p>In the days after this conversation, he and Hina skirted around each other, reluctant to be left alone together. Two weeks later, Hina was promoted to a managerial position in the firm’s fund business and moved to a different floor. When Hassan returned from winter vacation he found that the other half of the desk was empty. All that remained was a small hole in the wall where Hina’s diploma had once hung.</p><p>Now that they are back in Karachi, Hassan and Sara joke that they are “foreign-returned,” a designation that their U.K.-educated uncles still put on their business cards, as if it denoted membership to an exclusive club. They sit in Sara’s parents’ kitchen drinking tea and talking about their time in the U.S., trading theories about why Hassan’s contract wasn’t renewed. True, it might have been his performance review. But it could also have been his name. Or his nationality. Or his visa status. Either way, no one in Karachi blames them for wanting out of the new America.</p><p>Hassan will look for work soon, but first, he tells Sara, he wants to reacclimate. It takes two hours to read the papers cover to cover. The local news feels almost comforting in its sameness: a litany of power outages, corruption scandals, society parties. The international news is filled with talk of war. By the time he finishes, it is almost time to think about lunch.</p><p>Always, when they speak of Connecticut, it seems as if the best part of the story hasn’t happened yet. It’s then that Hassan thinks of the Ahmeds. Ali, helping the kids with their homework while Mona fixes dinner. Ali and Mona debating whom to invite to their next party. Hassan tries to imagine the guest list. Strange how quickly the names and faces are receding—blurring together into one large, homogenous pool.</p><p>Mostly when he imagines life in America he thinks of the house that Sara wanted: a white clapboard Colonial with green shutters. He sees dusk falling on the freshly shovelled driveway, the lights blinking on one by one. But he doesn’t see Sara in the house, or the children that they plan to have. Rather, he sees another man’s children, Hina’s siblings: three girls and a boy. They are poring over textbooks at the dining-room table or playing Ping-Pong in the basement. They look content in their kingdom, padding around the carpets in their socks. ♦</p>	Sadia Shepard	January 8, 2018 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/01/08/foreign-returned	Connecticut	Pakistan	Immigrants	Muslims	Suburbia		Hassan	Third	Immigrants
Freight	<p>In <span data-page="page_1"></span>February of 1939, having failed to establish myself as a screenwriter in Hollywood, I decided to hitchhike back to New York, where my future wife waited. It was a bland California morning, pleasant and calm.</p><p>The rendezvous with my friend Royer, who was to take me to a road frequented by hitchhikers, was effected with a minimum of anxiety. I was early; he was a half hour late. He said little en route. Remarks about the highway, tags and scraps of nervous observations.</p><p>The miles slipped by all too quickly, covering only the merest jot of the great journey stretching before me, the great journey I would soon have to undertake unassisted, unbefriended, and in ignorance.</p><p>Where my highway toward El Centro and Royer’s toward a walnut ranch forked he let me off. We shook hands. I stood a minute looking after the dwindling vehicle, loath to surrender my last connection to companionship, to someone concerned. The car disappeared around a curve in the road.</p><p>Undoubtedly I was too reticent, undoubtedly I was too shy. For all my tentative thumbing, my waggling and waving of arms, I got only as far as the next town, and by then the winter sun was already low in the west. A fellow-hitchhiker offered to guide me to the place he was going to stay: it was something better than a flophouse, he said, but not much.</p><p>About a mile hike brought us to the place, and it fitted his description—not much better than a flophouse on the Bowery, the chief difference being the absence of drunks standing, drooping and tattered, in the doorway. Evidently aimed at a clientele of transients like myself, it went by the improbable name of the Dew Drop Inn, and cost fifty cents a night per cubicle. Furnished with only a bed and a light, it was innocent of heat at night, with no showers in evidence, only lavatories and crappers. I was counselled by the occupant of the neighboring cubicle, a little wiseacre with a mustache, to make for Holtville, rather than the route that looked shortest, because it was better travelled and better for picking up rides.</p><p>It was a cinch to Holtville—the wise guy with the mustache was right. Effortlessly, I parlayed one ride into another, and reached Holtville early in the afternoon. And there I stuck. And not only I—a whole file of hitchhikers, ludicrous in our numbers, compared with the trickle of traffic going our way. The reason for the scarcity of vehicles wasn’t hard to find: from Holtville to Yuma, Arizona, next leg of the journey, lay a stretch of road, fifty miles or more, through desert, devoid of towns. Not only did few autos and trucks make the trip, but for us hitchhikers only the whole trip was of any use. Otherwise, we’d be marooned in the middle of nowhere, in or between hamlets without names, tiny blank circles on a map. Though some trucks did pass by, truckers were enjoined by their insurance companies or by their employers not to pick up riders. The driver of the very infrequent passenger car that went all the way, who might have wished to give someone a lift, seeing that long file strung out along the highway, must have feared that he would be mobbed if he stopped for anyone.</p><p>The hours went by; so did the cars and trucks, but I advanced not a yard toward Yuma. And, as far as I could see, neither did anyone else, though most of us must have marched at least five miles back and forth in the hope of finding a more propitious station whereon to stab the air with our thumbs: futile Jack Horners were we. One heard the flinty jests of desperation: some guys had been here for three days (I could well believe it); some had applied for resident status. Many hitchhikers, I could see, having abandoned all hope of getting out of town eastward, had crossed the highway and were thumbing their way back west—and with far greater success. Anything to get out of Holtville, I thought. But then I learned that their aim was to backtrack to a railroad junction and hop a freight from there. To hell with the highways, they said.</p><p>I felt the same way myself. But, at a loss, I continued to stab the air with my thumb. Then I struck up with a short-statured wise guy. I thought for a moment that he was the one I had met in the flophouse the evening before, who had advised Holtville as my best bet. But he wasn’t. This wise guy had no mustache. Nor would he ever have blown his last fifty cents for a flop, as I soon discovered.</p><p>He was as brash a guy as ever I met; his story was that he drove new automobiles from Detroit to California, which somehow enabled the dealer to avoid paying an entry tax. Now and then, he drove a “hot” car, a stolen car, from one state to another. In between, he sold used cars. He had been on a drunk for days. Now he was penniless. He had eaten nothing since yesterday; he was beating his way back to Texarkana, his home town. He knew all the ropes, all modes of travel, both highway—which he damned with heartfelt anathema—and freights. If only he<span data-page="page_2"></span> could get to Yuma and the freight yards, wouldn’t he show the rest of these lugs how to move? Acting with all the due circumspection of one who has only a few dimes on his person, after great deliberation I invited him into one of the truck stops for coffee and doughnuts. I now had a buddy. His name was Johnny Graham.</p><p>We thumbed in tandem now, buddies, but to no avail. Seeking luckier spots, we passed and passed again the prominent sign on the road that read: “Soliciting Rides Liable to Chain Gang.”</p><p>“I’m gonna steal that goddam sign,” Johnny threatened.</p><p>But night came, and, lit up by approaching headlights that never slowed down, the sign was still there. So were we. At last, miraculously, our symbiosis paid off. Because I treated him to another round of doughnuts and coffee in the truck stop, he and I were free to solicit drivers, our fellow-diners, directly. My polite entreaties got me only “Sorry, bud, it’s my job.” For all his brazen importunings, his truck-driver cant, his bold familiarity, Johnny didn’t fare any better. A few times, truck drivers seemed on the point of yielding, but thought better of it. Then, at 2:15 <em class="small">A.M.,</em> Johnny’s tactics paid off: “All right, you win,” the trucker said.</p><p>In the back of the cab, behind the driver and his helper, was a concealed bunk, and that was to be our hidden roost for the next fifty miles. The truck butted through the freezing, thin night air, the treads of the heavy tires crooning to the highway asphalt. Through the bunk’s portholes, single stars kept pace with us for long distances, steady as icy rivets. The truck slowed down, came to a stop. In the cold void, we heard a woman’s voice, though we could see no one, a young woman’s voice, cheery and clear, in greeting. And then the cab door opened, slammed shut; again the heavy vehicle lumbered into speed. Johnny and I merely looked at each other. All that mattered was that we were rolling toward Yuma. Perhaps another quarter to a half hour passed, and then the truck came to a stop. We heard the driver get out: “Far as I can take you, fellas.” He opened the bunk door. “Can’t take you into town.”</p><p>“Sure! Sure!” We understood. We sprang from the bunk down to the highway. “Thanks, Mister. Thanks, pal. Thanks a million.”</p><p>The truck stayed there, and we soon walked out of range of its dimmed headlights. Incurious, we did not turn at the sound of truck door opening, thudding closed. With hope renewed, we walked briskly toward the east, toward a horizon still seamless with night, starry, in quiet, keen air, and made out the first city lights about a half mile away: Yuma. And soon we were treading sidewalk.</p><p>The gleam of a diner pried into the dark street, promising warmth, food, coffee, against the inhospitable desert gloom behind us. “Coffee an’?” I invited.</p><p>“Sure would.” Sheer animal hunger sounded in his plea.</p><p>We entered, into humid comfort, found stools, ordered—coffee and two doughnuts apiece (at a cost of ten cents each) and, asking the waitress to hold it a sec, took turns to the lavatory.</p><p>And now, refreshed, another brisk walk, to the freight yards, as the night sky streaked into abrasion of dawn. Johnny spoke to other hobos moving along the gravel lanes between freights, and we found a boxcar and clambered aboard. We congratulated ourselves on being alone, on having a private freight car. Alas, too soon. By the time the gray gravel between tracks shone in broad daylight, twenty more birds of passage had joined us. The door of the boxcar opened briefly on warm sunshine when a belated hobo climbed aboard, and rolled closed again. And finally, after those rumblings and bumpings, the mysterious joltings heralding the setting forth of freight trains, we clanked into motion, picked up speed, and were on our way. We rolled the door open to let in the sun. Some of us stretched out on the boxcar floor; some lay jackknifed against the walls; some sat. A gray bearded old hobo, a “bindle stiff,” Johnny labelled him, methodically unfurled various-sized rectangles of blanket and, sighing tranquilly, with hands locked together, reclined on his improvised couch, his head propped up by a stained knapsack.</p><p>I found a place next to Johnny. I hadn’t slept in twenty-four hours. Awhile I watched in gratitude as the spectacular Arizona landscape whizzed past the open boxcar door—sunny butte and sloping sunlit mesa. And then overpowering drowsiness meshed everything together into a single clacking carrousel. Ah, what was more wonderful than travelling by freight!</p><p>The train made a stop in Tucson. How long it would stay there nobody knew. For an hour or so, we joined the other hobos basking on the sun-warmed planks adjacent to the railroad street crossing. And then, bored, impatient, we strolled over to Main Street and, with the security of outcasts, studied the prosperous citizenry. A rodeo was due to be held that afternoon, so the town may have had more than its usual complement of visitors, and these and the notices of the coming diversion, and the air of anticipation engendered by it, beguiled us into loitering overlong. When we got back to the freight yard, our train had left.</p><p>Another was due in<span data-page="page_3"></span> a little while, the hobos said. And, soon after, it thundered into the yard, slowing down, but only as if it meant to go on. I ran alongside at top speed, Johnny behind me. I had already been instructed never to grab the steel ladder at the end of a boxcar, but only the one at the beginning—in the direction the train was moving—because a miss on the rear ladder might mean plunging headlong under the wheels of the following car, while a miss on the front ladder would only send me slamming against the freight wall, and I would be hurled back, away from the train. So I made a grab for the front-end ladder, grasped, held on, climbed up to the catwalk atop the freight, knelt, clung to the catwalk—and the train suddenly stopped. Johnny howled with laughter.</p><p>“Jeez, that is funny,” I said. “Risk your neck, and have the train stop.”</p><p>“No. You’re funny.”</p><p>“Me?”</p><p>“You’re hot shit, the way you grab a train on the fly.” Johnny guffawed again. “If I ever saw anybody who couldn’t make up his mind gettin’ on a freight, it’s you.”</p><p>“Yeah? Why?”</p><p>“Chrissake, grab the goddam ladder. It ain’t gonna bite ye.”</p><p>Chagrined at my ineptitude, I followed Johnny along the catwalk, leaping the gap from car to car. But chagrin was a luxury I couldn’t afford here; even reflecting on it was inadmissible for somebody being whittled down to nobody, just another hobo, and an incompetent one at that. Pay attention. Watch what you’re doing.</p><p>“Here’s a reefer,” Johnny said. He pulled up the rust-covered hatch and peered down. “Nobody in it.”</p><p>In the dark refrigerator compartment, its length running the width of the freight, and little more than a yard wide, a steel ladder, affixed to the wall, led down to the bottom. We descended, and looked back overhead, where the reefer hatch could be rigged ajar by an attached rod. Johnny climbed up a few rungs and set the rod.</p><p>“You got an extra handkerchief, right?”</p><p>“Yeah. What d’you want?”</p><p>“Gimme it, will ye?” And, taking the handkerchief, he wedged it under the supporting brackets of the tilted hatch. “That’s so a brakey knows we’re down here.” He climbed down and explained: tramps asleep when the brakeman overhead locked the hatch in freezing weather—to protect the cargo—had been frozen to death when the car was left on a siding out of earshot.</p><p>“I get it.”</p><p>The train began moving. We half sat, half reclined on the reefer floor. It was not a solid floor but a drainage floor: curved steel bars about a half-inch thick with two-inch spaces between them enabled the water of melting ice cakes in the summer to escape to a tray and the tracks beneath. The steel drainage scimitars pressed cruelly into my buttocks.</p><p>Johnny soon fell asleep. I lit my pipe, and watched smoke vent through the transom of the rigged hatch into the narrow dusk of day’s end. The chill penetrated as the light faded . Soon, frigid dark roared into the confines of the empty ice compartment. How to pass the long night?</p><p>Long night awake . . . long night cold . . . long night on a freight, five days old . . . long night of <em>clackety-clack, clackety-clack</em> on wheels pounding eastward over the segmented tracks . . .</p><p><em>Howooo</em>. Train whistled approaching a level crossing. What crossing? A crossing in Texas. How to pass the long cold night?</p><p>Why, writer manqué, are you not? Novelist manqué, no? Desperately balked of all the narratives that you tried, narratives that came to naught, no? Came to nort, all abort.</p><p>Why, sternly bring your faculties to a focus by composing an autobiography, freely associative . . . but governed by implicit rules of narration . . . augment suspense toward a climax . . . a climax that would exclude present distress. Hey, good ground rules: augment suspense toward a climax . . . that would exclude . . . the cold ache of legs as you lean against the swaying wall, the icy carving of the scimitar bars into butt . . . or shoulder . . . or flank, driving you upright again. Where would you begin? You already told them of your Lower East Side boyhood in one novel; what would you do, then?</p><p>No, what happens in this vision I have, in this early manhood, seems to defy the ground rules I just laid down. In this thundering crypt above the rails, I see my life as pivoting about certain crucial, certain critical points, where the event determined the rest, the lamentable sequence that followed inexorably in its wake. <em>Clackety-clack. Clackety-clack</em>. The year is 1914. Now, that’s one year after the year in which my novel concludes. Right? Here’s the nub of the disaster: Zayde and Baba (grandfather, grandmother), two uncles, and two aunts, one skip ahead of the Great War, depart Galicia, sell—Zayde does—the little <em>gevelb</em>, the little store, in the little hamlet of Veljish (on no map at all), which pays for second-class passage to <em>Ameritchka</em>, to New York, to join us. Now, were it not for that semi-Americanized whoremonger of a hotel waiter, my uncle Saul, who looked down his snooty beak at the East Side, and persuaded the Galitzianer pilgrims to settle in Harlem, ah, how different my history would<span data-page="page_4"></span> have been, how different I. For Mom would have been content to remain on the East Side, in our lofty aerie overlooking the breezy East River, on Avenue D and Ninth Street. And I would not have been plucked out of my Orthodox Yiddish mini-state like a what? Vegetable, or a mandrake in Blake’s etching. I would have grown up in unquestioned Orthodoxy, tough little cocksure fisticuffian gamin, who had to hide under the bed when mothers came looking for him for having bloodied their kids’ noses. Me, I, alas, who in the course of a single year among the Irish on 119th Street in East Harlem went from a wiry kid to “Fat, fat, the water rat. Fifty bullets in your hat.” Oh, don’t blame the Irish.</p><p>I was outnumbered, and hung around Mom, even learning to embroider cloth between two hoops while I sat on the stoop beside her. Jewboy Achilles become Mama’s boy, tied to her apron strings. Oh, don’t blame the Irish. I should have fought, biffed and battled, for I was once good at it, and that was their language: biff and battle. I had nothing else to recommend me: poor eyes, maladroit, too, couldn’t catch a ball and couldn’t throw one, lousy at stickball. Who knew about such goyish sports on the East Side? Or marbles, or pitching pennies? But don’t blame the Irish. A punch in the nose for a punch in the nose. Jew bastard! But oh, untroubled I had been in my milieu, amid jabbering Jews under the omnipotent sway of a Hebrew God. And then I was suddenly hurled into the alien and incomprehensible goyish maw of East Harlem. Wanna fight? No. So don’t blame the Irish. . . .</p><p>Go sit and brood, sit and brood, if you can rest your ass on serried scimitars.</p><p>But that was the first, that was the first switch in the tracks, I still insist. First major fork in life’s journey. And <em>clackety-clack</em> and <em>clackety-clack</em> all you damn please.</p><p>The movers stole Mom’s red coral beads. Red coral beads, red coral beads, Mom’s mourned-for cherry-red coral beads. They disappeared in transit to Harlem.</p><p>But I got no support, I got no support. What the hell do you expect of a kid who had a timid mouse of a father, frightened, panicky, whacked the daylights out of me when Mrs. True from upstairs accused me of pushing her kid to the sidewalk, which I never did, but the pack of little goyim he was with ran when I turned in mock menace. She slapped me in front of Pop, and then he added a barbarous beating, so atrocious that dumpy, squat Mrs. Shapiro from the first floor intervened: “You’ll destroy your own son for a goya?” And Mom arrived from shopping, frantic hearing my screams all the way through the hall, planting herself before Pop, the frenzied madman, and demanding of Mrs. True belligerently, “Vot you vant?”</p><p>Oh, my mother. How ugly, how lowering gloomy the kitchen setting. Oh, my mother. Beaten the hell out of, drubbed to a whimper, to a snivelling nullity—</p><p>Try rolling over to the other flank.</p><p>I can’t say it often enough. They had no right to pluck me out like a radish, like a beet, like a scallion, like a parsnip from among my own. And force me to grow hydroponically, a root crop like me, that adored the dirt and the din of the twoscore streets of my Jewish mini-state. The irony of it: Zayde, given name Ben Zion, Orthodox Jew with a beard, comes to these shores with his family, and undoes Orthodoxy. You forget the anticipation, the delirious anticipation of the June day, sitting two flights up in the new apartment prepared for them by Saul and Mamie, my aunt, who lived across the street on 115th Street between Park and Madison, a nice “<em>bitvinn</em>” it was called. What did that little tyke imagine his newly arriving kinfolk would look like? Rich, generous, loving Jewish nobility come to rescue him from the unhappiness of the hostile goyish environment of 119th Street! Jewish nobility come to irradiate his unhappy home life! Empathetic, aye, opulent kinfolk, informed with novelty, with captivating fable, proffering handfuls of silver coins, endlessly doting, endlessly rejoicing in him.</p><p>Instead, getting out of the two taxicabs to the screams of hysterical Mamie from on high of “Tata, Tata! Oy, Mama, Mamaleh!” that drew the attention of all passersby within earshot on the street below were six ordinary, newly arrived, bewildered Jewish immigrants from Galicia in the erstwhile Austrian Empire.</p><p>With Saul overseeing the unloading of persons and baggage, amid commotion in the hall, the newcomers and their escorts ascended to the apartment. Everybody rushed in. Embraces ensued, resounding embraces. Under the supervision of Zayde, the newcomers were herded to the kitchen sink, and each rinsed his or her mouth with salt water. I swear, they rinsed it with something. Epsom salts? Nah. Go ask an Orthodox Jew. But that isn’t the crux of the matter; the crux of the matter is, or was, that your dreams of noble permissiveness, openhanded, free-hearted affection, contracted into a bearded, paunchy Jew who spoke Yiddish so dense you could scarce make way against it, contracted into a Slavic, snub-nosed, gentle, dear, depleted Baba, with little gold-rimmed eyeglasses, dam of a dozen offspring. The older of the two<span data-page="page_5"></span> immigrant uncles looked like Baba, stocky, aged eighteen, with a head of thick, wavy chestnut hair, and the younger uncle, long-nosed and straight-haired, dazed into reticence, stood apart, gangly and tall. One aunt, the older, was composed and slow-spoken, while the other aunt was green-toothed, erratic, and noisy with excitement. Both homely. I shrank. Too much to absorb, all their lopsided gesticulations, shrugging, their grimaces and outcries: “<em>Oy, gevalt un azoy, oy, gevalt un azoy! Takeh emes</em>? <em>Un azoy! Oy ich khalesh un azoy!”</em></p><p>With Mom’s permission to leave, with a nickel to comfort me, but still dejected, I walked to Central Park, and there climbed the granite outcrop atop the rowboat-dotted lake on 110th Street. And along a crease in the ground in a bosky grove where ran a little trickle of rainwater I became the buckskinned and fringed American Scout, self-reliant, self-sufficient, in the pristine wilderness of America I knelt down and drank, in ritual, dim commitment. Sipping from the polluted rivulet in much-trodden Central Park. That’s not the crux; that’s just a boyhood memory.</p><p>Oh, my legs ache, ache standing. But sitting down is scant comfort on a seat of sabres.</p><p>The brain incandesces and fades, synapses glow and gutter out. You left Judaism, right? Right, ol’ boy, ol’ boy. Left Judaism, and damn glad to. You go with Zayde on a sleepy summer Shabbes to the shul, to the prayer-book musty tenement ground-floor synagogue, sit hour after hour and daven where shown, pray but not know what for, glibly match the right sounds to the printed letters, as you were taught to do on the East Side. And Zayde’s proud of you, his oldest grandson, sure, sure, growing up devout. But the thing wears threadbare for a kid, is a hell of a bore—even though, ah, that was fun, at the Havdalah service—Havdalah, wasn’t it? Half a dollah. To be made much of by the other bearded Jews, Shloymeh F., Zayde’s so dignified older brother, actually wore a shiny silk top hat on Shabbes, what a stereotype target for snowballs if he’d ever appeared in my part of Harlem, among the juvenile scamps, Shloymeh with his forked gray beard and proud bearing and rich clearing of the throat. And the other pious congregants offering the only urchin at the Havdalah wine and lovely segments of salt herring, and—man, when that hit my palate the first time!—ripe wrinkled Greek olives.</p><p>All right, all right, sit down, if you can’t stand up anymore. But the novelty wasn’t enough to keep you coming regularly. So you shirked. And you and little Eddy F., the Irish widow janitor’s kid, became friends, and he showed you how to make tin-can telephones that stretched on a string from his flat on the ground floor to yours a flight up the worn stairs. And after many a fuzzy greeting, many a humming giggle and blurry message, you were well on the way to shedding your Judaism.</p><p>I stood up. Cold vacancy, interminable rattle and roar, my partner curled up in sleep, and a single blue star trailing like a distant kite, in and out of view. I’m tired of your yarn. The point is I’m here on this jigging jiggling freight. I survived. I’ll wait the goddam night out. I’m surly, I’m rancorous.</p><p>Weariness thrust in abeyance by the sudden thud on the roof of the freight car, I looked up: <em>thud</em>. Someone had leaped from one freight roof to another. The reefer hatch was lifted. Density of a person obliterating his shape of night sky, bowed, “Who down dere?” under stars spreading all about him. “Hey, you—you down dere?” A Negro voice.</p><p>“We are!” I yelled up. And alarmed: “Hey, Johnny!”</p><p>“Wha’ ?”</p><p>“How many you down dere?”</p><p>Apprised in an instant, and instantly hostile: “There’s two of us down here already. That’s enough. We don’t want no more.”</p><p>The one overhead lingered for a moment, and then withdrew.</p><p>“Boy, it’s cold up there right out in the open. I hope he finds someplace to hide,” I said.</p><p>“He’s a nigger. He’ll find a place to duck. I never worry about ’em.” Arkansas spoke through Johnny.</p><p>“I wonder where the hell he’s been? Come out all of a sudden that way.”</p><p>“He should have stayed wherever he was, God damn him. I was sleepin’ good. I mighta slept all the way to El Paso.” He reached for his cap, massaged his glimmering features, yawned noisily, his teeth gleaming at the terminal grunt.</p><p>An hour later, Johnny’s glimmering face tipped up toward the roof. “You hear that?”</p><p>“I think so.”</p><p>“Is that the nigger again?”</p><p>“I don’t know.”</p><p>“It can’t be a shacky.”</p><p>“No? Why not?”</p><p>“If he was closin’ up the reefers, we’da heard them other hatches slam.”</p><p>“You mean closed against the cold?”</p><p>“Yeah. It’s that black bastard.”</p><p>Certainty grew, grew as swiftly as the distant thud of someone landing on the catwalk at the farther end of the freight became bounding footsteps approaching. Desperate hands raised the hatch overhead.</p><p>“Hey, I’m comin’ down, man. I’m freezin’.”</p><p>“There’s two of us down here already. I told you. Stay out!”</p><p>“Dere’s three, fo’ in de others. Dere’s five in one.”</p><p>“Bullshit. Keep goin’.”</p><p>“Been over de whole freight, man. Dere’s only two o’ you.” The voice was young. “I’m comin’ down.”</p><p>“You try it! I’m tellin’ you, boy. Two’s enough down<span data-page="page_6"></span> here.”</p><p>The figure peering down from above didn’t seem so much uncertain as restrained, trying to sense by instinct what the temper was below, the forces he had to brace himself to confront.</p><p>“For Christ sake, let him come down,” I whispered.</p><p>“What for? Fuck’s too lazy to go all the way up to the locomotive. There’s lots o’ reefers.”</p><p>“That hatch cover! Jesus, if he locked us in— You crazy?”</p><p>“I’m comin’ down, man.”</p><p>Raised all the way, the hatch opened into a transom gorged with stars. Cascades of starlight poured through the gaping sluice above as he stooped, took his first step down, his booted foot seeking the rung below; and before he closed the hatch, stemming the flood of starlight above him, something—something metallic—glinted in the same hand. Down he came to the reefer bottom—woefully underclad, only a jacket over his shirt. With hands in pockets, “Man, I’m cold. Gettin’ out o’ dat wind like comin’ to a stove.”</p><p>“It’s all right,” I said.</p><p>Johnny moved silently to my side of the compartment.</p><p>“I guess we got room,” I said. “Where were you?”</p><p>“In a gondola. Layin’ flat an’ huggin’ de bottom. Man, I like to freeze to death. I said I gotta get outa here, I gotta get outa here, ’fo’ I freeze stiff. I tried ridin’ behind a tank car. Too cold to live.”</p><p>“You want a smoke?”</p><p>“Sleep. Dat’s what I want, man.” He took his hand out of his jacket pocket. “I ’fraid to go to sleep in dat gondola. If I fall asleep in dat gondola, dey pick me up froze harder’n a rock. This is the fust time I feel safe to sleep.”</p><p>Drawing his knees up, his small hat jammed down on his head, he slipped to the reefer floor, and as he turned on his side he retrieved a short length of glinting metal from his jacket pocket, slid the hand holding the object between the curved steel bars of the drain, and deposited the glinting piece on the drip pan beneath. He was asleep in a minute—coughed himself awake; his hand groped between drainage bars, and, reassured, he stretched out his legs as far as he could, hat still jammed down on his small head, motionless, audibly, he fell asleep.</p><p>“He’s got a knife,” Johnny whispered.</p><p>“I guess so.”</p><p>“Son of a bitch. That’s why he come down. Two of us, he figured, an’ he’s got a knife.”</p><p>“What the hell’s the difference?” I hissed. “He’s asleep, isn’t he? That’s all he wanted.”</p><p>“How do you know?”</p><p>“Oh, bullshit.” The pervasive shadowy Jew in the background flinched against myriad wounds suffered in centuries past. “Listen, Johnny, I’m not going to argue about it. It’s a waste of time. You want to stretch out and go to sleep? Go ahead. I can’t sleep. I’ll—I’ll watch.”</p><p>“I’m not afraid of him. It ain’t that. They’re all yeller anyway. It’s just that nobody else’d let him down, an’ we did. Shit, they’d tell him there was six in the reefer.”</p><p>An angry silence. Better keep quiet. Futile: you’ll never penetrate that barrier; you don’t even understand it, can’t put it into words. Screwy. No more sense than a puppy dog chasing his tail. Think of something else.</p><p>I slid down to his end of the steel bars of the drainage floor. “Ow.” Released from aching knees, I welcomed the few minutes of respite before the rigid scimitars against my buttocks supplanted old pain with new.</p><p>“I can see what he’s got.” Johnny settled beside him.</p><p>“You can?” Listlessly, “What?”</p><p>“Table knife, that’s all. It’s no goddam razor.”</p><p>“All right. I got a jackknife. How’s that?”</p><p>“Better git it out an’ keep it open. Just keep it open in your jacket pocket.”</p><p>“Oh, for Christ sake.” Peevishly, I rolled my rump away from the biting drainage bars, pulled the jackknife out of my back pocket, opened the three-inch Boy Scout blade, and exhibited it.</p><p>“You stab with it,” Johnny said. “Go right for the belly. Know what I mean? You hold the blade down with your thumb and stab.”</p><p>“Oh, nuts.” I dropped the open jackknife into my jacket pocket.</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“Yeah,” I retorted angrily. “You know what I think? You got it ass backward. That poor colored guy is carrying that cheesy knife to protect himself. That’s why. They wouldn’t let him into any of the reefers. You can tell why he came down here. If he was going to fight for his life to keep from freezing, we were his best chance. Jesus, can’t you see that? The guy’s sleeping on that goddam steel like a feather bed. Look at him. He hasn’t moved an inch in all this time. Doesn’t hear us. Anything. He’s absolutely worn out.”</p><p>“Worn out, my ass. He’s used to it. You don’t know these fuckin’ niggers. They’re tougher’n rawhide.”</p><p>“O.K. I’ve had enough. I don’t want to talk about it anymore.”</p><p>Bang and jerk of freight-car coupling. Each time the car slacked its motion over flat Texas, I reflected, the locomotive had to jerk it onward. That goddam boob and his nigger nuttiness had me sitting here with an open Boy Scout knife in my jacket pocket. Christ, absent-minded as I was—and cold—I was apt to cut myself before I cut anybody else. I ought to snap the blade closed before I thrust my<span data-page="page_7"></span> hand in my pocket to warm my fingers. Boy, that crazy Arkansas bastard. Wasn’t he crazy?</p><p>“Want the tobacco?” I made a peace overture.</p><p>“Nah. . . . Thanks. I’m beginnin’ to feel like a little shut-eye again.”</p><p>“Yeah? Wish I could say the same. I feel it, but it doesn’t do me any good.”</p><p>“What’re you gonna do? Be a watchman till light?”</p><p>“I don’t know. It looks that way.”</p><p>“Aw, let’s have a smoke, if you’re not going to sleep. O.K.?” I brought out the can of Prince Albert. We rolled cigarettes, struck a match, lighting up the thin, jackknifed form sound asleep on the gleaming steel drainage bars. We smoked in silence.</p><p>Nothing to do. Lead the way. Pretend to sleep. Maybe the guy would follow suit, and we could drop the subject. I mashed the half-smoked cigarette against a drainage bar, curled on my side. Room enough for my shoes to the side of the sleeper’s boots . . .</p><p>The stratagem worked. In a few minutes, when I cautiously lifted my head to peer, with arm pillowing face, Johnny’s dark form lay bunched in sleep. Jesus, the arch-enemies, offset, end to end, nether to nether, like a what? Couldn’t think of anything. Feet to feet. Two feet to feet. <em>Eine kleine Nachtmusik</em> . . . in a reefer . . .</p><p>That was sleep coming on, sleep. Ah, sleep, it is a precious thing, beloved from pole to pole . . . Oh, threshold, beautiful threshold of let go.</p><p>Utterly spent, I slept until after daybreak, until after morning light was framed in the rigged hatch overhead, unaware that my two fellow-travellers were standing hunched over at opposite walls of the reefer, saying little. I awoke when the freight’s tempo changed, the slowing down of motion allowing the distinct creak of car and train tracks beneath to emerge from the roar.</p><p>“We comin’ to de yahds,” the young Negro said, slender and limber, now that I could see him—and chipper, too, in movement. He had apparently slept the night through from the minute he lay down.</p><p>“We’re gittin’ to El Paso,” Johnny said. “C’mon, wake up. We got to get ready to get off her.”</p><p>Dreary and stiff, I got to my feet.</p><p>“No bull ketch me climbin’ down,” the Negro youth announced confidently. “Ah run him a race on de roof to a gondola, an’ den oveh de other side.”</p><p>“Yeah? What if he pulls a gun?”</p><p>“Ah jump the other side of de freight, man, like I tol’ you, ’fo’ I let him pistol-whip me.”</p><p>He seemed capable of it, too, lithe and agile. And as the train kept up its moderate, even rate of speed, he knelt down on one knee, slipped his brown flat wrist through the space between the drainage rails, and brought out the ordinary table knife we had seen him secrete there the night before. The streaked roughness of the crudely sharpened blade flashed a moment in daylight. He dropped it into his jacket pocket. Dully, I weighed his motives. Certainly he wouldn’t dare—against a railroad bull, a man armed with a gun?</p><p>In Texas? Jesus, he’d be lynched! Why had he waited until daylight to retrieve the weapon . . . to display it?</p><p>Johnny’s warning interrupted my foggy groping. His words came in a lowered voice and with a kind of worried severity, and, to my surprise, were not about the Negro youth. “You see one, a big guy—”</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>“A railroad bull, for Chrissake. You gotta get down an’ away fast. You woke up yet?”</p><p>“Yeah. What does he do? Wait for every freight that comes in?”</p><p>“No. But you never know when he’s around. Loosen up. Stamp your feet, wave your arms. C’mon.”</p><p>“Jesus, I had a helluva night.”</p><p>“He won’t give a shit about that. Loosen up.” He moved his own arms in prompting, kept a steady gaze on the Negro youth.</p><p>Who smiled. “Yeah, man, y’gotta git ready to hightail it outa them yahds. What if he Texas Slim?” He allowed himself a gleeful chuckle. “He fast on his feet.”</p><p>The freight slowed, slowed, jarred, came to a clashing stop, though we still felt in motion. Already the Negro youth had mounted the ladder and was climbing. Speedy and sure, his arm thrust back the hatch. Another rung upward and he heaved himself into open air; he sprang into daylight and disappeared. By the time I mounted the lower rungs, I could hear him climbing down the outside. And up, Johnny crowding behind me let the hatch fall back. Broad daylight. Blue dome of sky. Freight-car roofs in all directions. I had lived through it.</p><p>I jumped off the bottom rung down to the ground. But the Negro youth was tarrying there, and now I could guess, guess with a degree of certainty, at the same time oddly conscious that I felt no alarm. Standing between ramparts of brick-red and yellow freights, open gondolas, and tank cars, the brown youth in the small, earth-colored hat eyed us, me in particular, right hand in jacket pocket.</p><p>“Ah’m hungry, man.”</p><p>“So’re we,” Johnny said.</p><p>“Sell you my boots, man.” He pulled up his pants, bringing into view stockingless, lean brown shins above the edge of typical cowboy boots. “What y’all say? Sell ’em to yo’ fo’ jest a little money.”</p><p>The thoughts that<span data-page="page_final"></span> scurry through the mind: the whole proposition was preposterous. What the hell was he going to wear? And walk on this gravel? On streets? And in the cold? His wily eyes in his small head, watchful of every move, his wiry, quick body, ready for something, practiced, free and supple as a lynx. And a wickedly sharpened dinner knife hidden in his jacket pocket. And the two of us, yes, Johnny, shallow hard guy, and I, uncertain, untried, had to think of a way out of this, this emergency. Who the hell wanted his boots? He just wanted me to show some money. Forestall him somehow. Say O.K., and ask him how much, ask him to take them off. “Listen,” I said solicitously, “you need those boots. How’re you gonna get around?”</p><p>“Ah needs breakfas’ mo’n ah needs these boots right now.”</p><p>“Well, that’s different. You’d be crippled without boots. Wait a minute.”</p><p>Large-eyed, askance, and as sidelong as a profile out of Egypt, he watched me, the knuckles of his left hand bulging out the thin cloth of the jacket pocket. I fished into my topcoat. I knew there was a dime among the change there. I didn’t want to show any more money than that. But I had forgotten the open Boy Scout knife. It nicked me. Strange, strange: collapsed into unimaginable density as they say happened to a neutron star, all my history seemed in that instant, all its tenets, its dictates. Johnny beside me became tense, as my fingers avoided the open blade and fished for the dime. “Here, keep your boots. Take this dime. Get yourself something to eat.” I handed the youth the dime, conscious of Johnny’s scowl.</p><p>“Thanks, man.” Lissome again, he took the coin; or, rather, he accepted it, entirely without subservience or obligation, but with a short, triumphant laugh, turning, swiftly, strode jauntily away into the motley perspective between converging freights.</p><p>“What the hell’d you give him the dough for?” Johnny’s tough visage grimaced. Under the visor of his cap his brow furrowed in a scowl; even his short body all but flapped in a spasm of wrath, so pronounced it gave one the impression of a ripple contrary to the wave, pulses contrary to his stride. We hurried toward a break in the double lines of freights. “We coulda took care of him.”</p><p>I couldn’t help but grin. “Maybe.”</p><p>“What d’ye mean, maybe? I wouldn’t let no nigger ride over me.”</p><p>“I know.” But my mind seemed to be sifting out something worth a minute’s consideration. A kind of insight: that wasn’t the way—this was the important thing—a Negro was supposed to behave. That was it: not the cocksureness, no; then what? A sense of equality, independence. Sure, he had deliberately displayed the weapon to cow us. Or he would have grabbed the dough and run. And he was fast enough to get away. O.K. Whatever. Was I imagining things? Was it really a sign of change? A new stance of the Negro, a new attitude. “It’s only a dime.”</p><p>Johnny seemed to be going through some kind of parallel evaluation, but one that reached an entirely opposite judgment: “Sure it’s only a dime. But you let him git the better of you, you let him git ahead of you.”</p><p>“Oh, balls.” I tossed my head. “Get into a fight with a guy with a knife. For a dime?”</p><p>“I told you we oughta git that cheese dagger away from him while he was asleep. You saw him.”</p><p>“Well, we didn’t. And now get your throat slashed for ten cents.”</p><p>“He never would’ve. If we jumped him together, never. If he’d knowed you had a open jackknife, he never would’ve tried it.”</p><p>“Well, it wasn’t open.”</p><p>“What for you got your finger scratched?”</p><p>“I don’t know. Must have done it some other time.” Johnny clawed the air in frustration.</p><p>“Jesus.” I tried to shunt the conversation into other channels. “He turned out of sight about here, didn’t he?” I leaned forward to squint ahead. “How come we can’t find it?”</p><p>“We’re comin’ to it. There. I can see the snubbers at the end o’ the tracks. Trouble is you Northe’ners don’t know niggers. You keep lettin’ ’em git more an’ more outa their place. They’ll git us all down that way.”</p><p>“O.K. I see it. Boy, look at those lines of freights behind us.”</p><p>“It’s El Paso. It’s a big junction.”</p><p>Grumpy with each other but trying to reach an accommodation of necessity, knowing that we had to, we let the subject drop. With Johnny leading the way, in silence, like a short bridge to the commonplace, we rounded the spring snubber at the end of a line of freights and tramped out of the yard up the incline to the blacktop highway at the edge. We were now off railroad property, out of danger, in the clear, a couple of grouchy, slouchy, seedy hobos walking by the run-down dwellings at the outskirts of El Paso. ♦</p><p>(<em>The above is adapted from the almost two-thousand-page unedited novel manuscript that Roth was working on in the early nineteen-nineties.</em>)</p>	Henry Roth	September 25, 2006 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/09/25/freight	Blacks (African-Americans)	California	Childhood	Dimes	EL Paso, Texas	Freight trains	Unnamed	First	Immigrants
Katania	<p>When <span data-page="page_1"></span>I was a child, I had a family of doll people. They lived in a red shoebox painted to look like a house, with a dark-brown roof and yellow awnings. Inside the house, there was a set of plastic toy furniture, plus some random household items: a matchbox television, a mirror crafted from a piece of foil, and a thick rug secretly cut out of my old sweater. I also had a few plastic farm animals—a cow, a pig, a goat, and a very large (larger than the cow) chicken, which lived outside the shoebox.</p><p>The family itself consisted of the following individuals:</p><p>One pretty little doll, made of soft plastic, with painted-on hair and dress, who, in my games, represented me.</p><p>One naked, bald, vaguely female doll, made of hard shiny plastic, whom I designated the mother. I made her a Greek-style tunic out of an old handkerchief and glued a lock of my own hair to her head.</p><p>Two tiny baby dolls of unidentified gender, made of hard, matte plastic, and wrapped in blankets of the same kind of plastic.</p><p>And one hedgehog with a human body, dressed in a long skirt and apron, with tight, curly hair covered with a kerchief, to whom I assigned the role of grandmother.</p><p>What my family lacked was a father, but a father doll was a true rarity. Nobody I knew had a father doll. Most of the kids I knew didn’t even have fathers. I didn’t have a father; mine died when I was two. My family consisted of my mother, my grandmother, and me. That was perfectly normal. Fathers had a tendency to die, or to lose themselves to alcoholism, or to simply “up and go.” Our next-door neighbor up and went to the Far North one night. He announced his decision by screaming on the staircase, “I’m sick of you all!”</p><p>“So you’re just gonna up and go, huh? Well, good riddance!” his wife screamed back. But his three-year-old daughter cried for weeks. I could hear her through the thin walls of our apartment.</p><p>Fatherlessness was so common that even the Soviet authorities were aware of it. The Soviet authorities were famous for being protective of their citizens, so whenever a certain item was scarce they did their best to make that scarcity less conspicuous. My mother, who used to write school textbooks, was prohibited from even mentioning those scarce items. When composing a math problem, for instance, she couldn’t mention bananas, because they were impossible to get in most parts of Russia. She could use apples, but not bananas. Chicken, but not beef. Mothers, but not fathers. She was allowed to write, “A mother gave her three children six apples and asked them to divide the fruit equally,” but forbidden to write about a father asking his kids to do the same thing with bananas. She told me this when I was in my teens, and I didn’t believe her. I combed through my old textbooks to try to prove her wrong, but I couldn’t find a single mention of a father, beef, or bananas.</p><p>So imagine my surprise, my joy, when I suddenly got a father doll as a gift! My uncle had bought it for me on a business trip to Bulgaria. It was a beautiful doll, just the right size, a little shorter than the mother and the grandmother but taller than the kid. It had a hard body and a face made of soft, squeezable plastic, painted in masculine shades of brown. Brown eyes, brown lips, brown nostrils. Brown hair made out of some very hairlike material. A perpetual warm brown smile. It was dressed in what appeared to be a Bulgarian national costume of felt hat and boots, rumpled cotton pants, embroidered shirt, and a leather belt. This was exactly how I imagined an ideal father would look.</p><p>The father doll had only one imperfection—a bad hip. His left leg wouldn’t stay in place. It kept detaching from his torso and dangling in his pants. But I loved the doll so much that I didn’t see even this as a shortcoming until Tania pointed it out.</p><p>Tania and I had become friends exactly ten months before the arrival of the father doll. It was September, the first week of school, and Tania threw a tantrum during the annual Tea with Parents. We were all crowded into our small classroom, with our parents crouching over our kid-size desks. The school cafeteria provided us with hot tea, but the parents were required to bring pastries and cakes, and also a cup and a saucer for their child and themselves. Tania’s mother had apparently brought the wrong cup.</p><p>“I wanted the blue one!” Tania screamed. “The blue one with the gold rim! The blue one! The blue one!”</p><p>Her voice rose so high that I kept an eye on my cup, hoping it would break, the way cups sometimes did in movies when somebody screamed like that. But then I realized that it was far more interesting to watch Tania. She had fair skin, covered with pale freckles. She had turned tomato red, but her freckles had stayed the same color—I’d never seen anything like that. She closed her eyes, and squeezed her hands into fists, and a vein throbbed on her temple, bright blue and fat. Everybody else in the room<span data-page="page_2"></span> fell silent. Our teacher was very young—barely out of college—and she had no idea what to do. But Tania’s mother simply stood up and smiled and said that she’d go home and get the blue one. She was a tall woman, with a large soft body and a fair complexion like Tania’s. Even her hair was the same color as her daughter’s, only hers was fixed in a bun on the back of her head, and Tania’s was plaited into a thick braid.</p><p>Tania’s tantrum ended as soon as her mother was out the door. She opened her eyes and sat down, and her skin quickly faded back to pale pink. The teacher asked if she was O.K., and she nodded. Everybody started chatting, pouring tea, and cutting cake again, as if the tantrum had never happened. But I couldn’t take my eyes off Tania. She noticed my admiring stare and smiled at me with a warm and very grownup expression.</p><p>“Don’t you just hate it when you have to drink your tea from the wrong cup?” she said.</p><p>I nodded respectfully, as if I were very familiar with the difficulty of this situation. But what I admired was her courage. I would never have had the guts to throw a tantrum. And my mother would never have taken it so calmly. Just a few days before, she had kicked me in the ribs simply for crawling around on the floor and meowing while she was on the phone. I didn’t blame her. I had tried to meow into the receiver, even though I knew that she was talking to her boss.</p><p>After that tea, Tania and I started walking home together. We lived in the same building, which was only five minutes away from school. It was nine stories high and extremely long—it looked like a skyscraper lying on its side. There were twelve entrances. I lived in No. 2. Tania lived in No. 9. Across the street from our building there was an abandoned apple orchard. We often stopped there on the way home. We’d climb one of the trees and sit swinging our legs and talking about school, about our favorite cartoons, about our dolls. But I could never stay for more than fifteen minutes or so, because my grandmother was waiting for me at home.</p><p>Once, I complained to Tania about what a pest my grandmother was. Tania said that her grandmother was dead. “She died a year ago. Her lungs didn’t work. She was breathing like this.” Tania did a very good impression of rhythmic wheezing.</p><p>“My grandfather died of a stroke,” I said. “His whole body was paralyzed. He couldn’t even go to the bathroom by himself. The nurse had to stick her hand up his butt and get the poop out.”</p><p>“My grandmother’s sister died of a stroke, too,” Tania said. “She was in a coma. I don’t think she pooped at all.”</p><p>“How did your father die?” I asked.</p><p>I knew that Tania didn’t have a father, and for some reason I assumed that he was dead, like mine.</p><p>“My father isn’t dead!” Tania shrieked, her face turning red the way it had at the Tea with Parents. “He’s away on a business trip! In America. He misses me every day!”</p><p>I was so stunned by her sudden change of mood that I couldn’t process her words. I just stood there staring at her. She swung her schoolbag as if she were about to hit me on the head with it, but changed her mind and ran off toward her entrance. I went home, crying. I cried on and off for the rest of the day. My grandmother and then my mother kept asking me what was wrong, but I wouldn’t say. I didn’t really understand it myself. Perhaps what I was feeling was shame—not just the mortification of having made the wrong assumption about Tania’s father but the deeper, sickening humiliation of being excluded from the élite group of children who had fathers.</p><p>The next day at school, I tried to avoid Tania. I did my best not to look in her direction during classes; I didn’t talk to her at recess; I sat at the opposite end of the table at lunch. And at the end of the day I went into the bathroom and waited there until everybody had gone home. It didn’t work. When I finally came out, I saw Tania waiting for me on the school porch. I considered pretending that she wasn’t there, but then decided that that would be too silly. We walked home together.</p><p>After that incident, we never talked about our families again, but we did talk about our dolls. I would boast about how many animals mine had. “A cow, a pig, a really huge chicken!”</p><p>And Tania would say, with a dismissive smile, “Mine live in a city. There is no space for farm animals. Their names are Sigrid, Amaranta, and Arabella. Amaranta and Arabella are scientists, but Sigrid is an actress.”</p><p>One day Tania invited me over. I hesitated. She had a key hanging around her neck on a long blue ribbon. A lot of kids in my class had their apartment key hanging from their neck. They were supposed to go home, let themselves in, heat up their dinner, and wait for their mother to come home. They<span data-page="page_3"></span> knew how to turn on a stove; they didn’t worry that the match would burn down too quickly and hurt their fingers. They knew how to pour soup from the pot into their bowl without splashing it all over the floor. I couldn’t imagine ever becoming that accomplished. My grandmother was always waiting for me at home. She would watch from the window, and as soon as she saw me she’d put dinner on the stove and rush to open the door. I didn’t have to ring the bell, let alone unlock the door myself. I was afraid that if I went to Tania’s apartment I would somehow betray my incompetence. But if I didn’t go I might betray my incompetence in an even worse way.</p><p>I went. Tania unlocked the door with admirable skill. I said that I needed to call my grandmother. Tania pointed to the phone, which stood on a little shelf next to the coatrack. I called and told a complicated lie about an after-school gymnastics class. I hoped the gymnastics thing would impress my grandmother, who was always telling me that if I didn’t do gymnastics I would grow up with a crooked back. The lie worked, and I turned to Tania, expecting her to be impressed with my ingenuity. What I saw instead was a cold, mocking expression.</p><p>Her apartment was smaller than ours. Only one room—we had three. The TV was smaller, and the furniture shabbier, and the dishes in the cupboard didn’t gleam the way ours did.</p><p>“Do you want some of my dinner?” Tania asked.</p><p>I imagined her asking me to light a match or ladle the soup and shook my head.</p><p>“Good,” she said. “I’m not hungry, either. Do you want to see my dolls?”</p><p>I did. Very much so. [cartoon id="a17683"]</p><p>Tania’s dolls lived in a shoebox, too. Only her shoebox was white and stood perched on the edge of a large dresser. “It’s a skyscraper,” she explained. “Like they have in America.” The dolls didn’t have a lot of furniture, but they had a plastic airplane placed on a little shelf by the box. A tiny ladder led from inside their “apartment” to the plane.</p><p>“They need it when they go on business trips. Or, if there is a fire in the building, they can just get in the plane and fly off.”</p><p>“Where are they now?” I asked.</p><p>“Arabella is away on a business trip, but I can show you Amaranta and Sigrid.”</p><p>Amaranta was sitting in the bathtub. She looked a lot like my mother doll, but bigger and less bald. Sigrid was still in bed. Her head rested on a tiny pillow and her body was covered with a handkerchief. She was a tiny blonde, made of polished wood. She was beautiful and thin and foreign in a way my dolls could never hope to be.</p><p>“She’s very pretty,” I said.</p><p>“She’s talented, too,” Tania said.</p><p>As I was putting on my shoes to go home, I spotted another little doll stuck behind the shoe rack. This one was plastic. She had broken arms and a smashed-in face. I figured that this was Arabella.</p><p>The next time, we went to my place.</p><p>My grandmother gave us barley soup and chicken with mashed potatoes. I was a little worried that Tania wouldn’t like the food and would throw a tantrum or something, but she ate quickly and gracefully, said “Thank you,” and carried her dishes to the sink when she was done. My grandmother was delighted with her.</p><p>After dinner, I led Tania into my room. She took everything in with a quizzical expression, as if making an inspection.</p><p>“So you have your own room?” she asked.</p><p>I nodded. I was suddenly impressed by the fact that I had my own room.</p><p>“And you have a balcony?”</p><p>I said, “Yeah.”</p><p>She walked over to the rug that was hanging on the wall above my bed and yanked at its tassels.</p><p>“And you have rugs and everything,” she said.</p><p>I nodded and yanked at the tassels, too.</p><p>“You’re rich, aren’t you?”</p><p>I shrugged. I honestly didn’t know whether we were rich or not.</p><p>Tania seemed to like my dolls. She took them out of the box one by one and nodded in approval. She smiled at the grandmother. “Hedgehog! That’s clever,” she said. She petted my pig, she stroked the cow’s back. “So, they’re farmers, right? They live in a village?” she asked.</p><p>I had never thought about this. They had a barn and all those animals—so I supposed they were farmers and did live in a village.</p><p>“Listen,” Tania said. “Let’s give your animals a bath.”</p><p>But then my grandmother came in and said that it was time for Tania to go home and for me to do my homework.</p><p>“See this key?” Tania said, pointing to the key around her neck. “I can come and go as I please. But you, you’re stuck with your grandmother. You may be rich, but I have my freedom.”</p><p>Even then, at seven, I found the pathos of her words nauseating, but I was more pleased than angered. After she left, I looked around my room, at the balcony door, the rug, the nice furniture, and the red shoebox full of well-to-do farmers, and I felt enormous satisfaction. I didn’t have a key, but so what? I guess<span data-page="page_4"></span> I didn’t care that much about freedom.</p><p>My newfound identity was shattered as soon as my mother got home. I asked her if we were rich. She laughed for two full minutes, then bent over and pointed to her feet. “Look at my boots,” she said. “Do they look like the boots of a rich person to you?” The boots were scuffed, discolored, and covered with brown stains.</p><p>Later that night, on my way to the bathroom, I overheard my mother and grandmother talking about Tania.</p><p>“What do you think of that girl?” my mother asked.</p><p>“I don’t know.”</p><p>“Apparently she told Katya we were rich.”</p><p>“Rich?”</p><p>Now it was my grandmother’s turn to laugh.</p><p>Then she blew her nose and said, “She seemed polite.”</p><p>“Polite! Huh! I wish you could see how she treats her mother.” And my mother told my grandmother about the Tea with Parents tantrum. After that, she started whispering. I couldn’t hear anything. Fortunately for me, my grandmother, who was partly deaf, couldn’t hear, either. My mother had to switch back to her normal volume. She said she’d heard that Tania’s father had defected.</p><p>I heard my grandmother gasp.</p><p>“Sveta’s aunt said that he went on a business trip to the States and stayed. Just like that. Went to the authorities there and asked for refugee status or something. Can you imagine not caring about your wife and kid at all? Sveta’s aunt said that Tania’s mother was taken in for questioning. I’m sure she hadn’t even known about his plans.”</p><p>“Of course she hadn’t!” my grandmother said.</p><p>“Still, she got fired from her job.”</p><p>“That poor, poor woman.”</p><p>After that they started talking about our leaking fridge, and whether it was time to call somebody to fix it, and I tiptoed back to my room.</p><p>I didn’t entirely understand what they’d been talking about, but I gathered that what Tania’s father had done was something hateful and ugly. I felt sorry for Tania, but I also gloated a little. My father might have died, but at least he hadn’t done it on purpose.</p><p>In January, Tania proposed that we create a country for our dolls. We named it Katania—a combination of our names, Katya and Tania—and decided that it should have only two inhabited places: a village called Katushki and a city called T-City. The next step was to create a map.</p><p>We took four huge sheets of paper, taped them together, and started drawing. We painted the road from Katushki to T-City the usual brown color of roads. It meandered through the green of the woods, got almost as far as the ocean, made a loop, and returned to a bridge across the river. To make the river, we cut a wavy strip of foil from a chocolate wrapper and glued it to the map. The bridge was a simple strip of gray paper that we glued over the river. We weren’t happy with the bridge, because the yellow glue seeped out from under the edges and spilled all over the river.</p><p>“You know what it looks like?” I asked Tania, pointing to the glue stains.</p><p>“Snot!” she said, and I laughed, because that was exactly what I was thinking.</p><p>We spent months crouching over that map, drawing and redrawing the contours, changing or enhancing the colors, until our hands turned glossy and dark from all the paint. It was so much fun that I was sorry when the summer vacation started, because I knew that Tania would be going to stay with her grandfather in his village.</p><p>My own summer was uneventful, because I refused to go to camp. “But it’s free!” my mother lamented. “My office pays for it!” I was adamant. At the end of June, she took a week off to take me to Leningrad, but I came down with a fever on the train ride there and couldn’t enjoy the trip. On hot July weekends, my mother and I would take the morning train to the countryside, where we strolled down a dirt path through a wood to a pond, and we swam and then ate hard-boiled eggs and cheese on a grassy hill that smelled like hay. We always stayed a little longer than we’d planned and had to run to the station to catch our train back to Moscow.</p><p>On weekdays, I mostly stayed in our sweltering apartment, pacing around my room, complaining that I was bored. One day, I got inspired, took four old wooden rulers, broke them into pieces, and glued them back together in the shape of a chicken coop. My huge chicken barely fit inside. Otherwise, I mostly neglected my dolls.</p><p>But then my uncle came back from Bulgaria and brought me the father doll.</p><p>I don’t think I ever loved a toy so much. I spent the first week just playing with him all day long. When I noticed his bad hip, I tried to fix it with tape, but when that didn’t work I decided that he was even better this way. Even more special. I would feed him and dress him (his boots were removable!) and make the other family members dote on him.</p><p>“How’s your leg today, honey? Better? No? Not even a little? Well, sit down and rest, then.”</p><p>And he would beam his brown smile at everything and everybody.</p><p>I loved to sit<span data-page="page_5"></span> him on the sofa next to the little girl doll and a pig or a goat and have them watch my matchbox TV. They stayed like that for hours, while the babies slept, the grandmother cooked in the kitchen, and the mother either worked or pasted her hair on in the bathroom. “Isn’t it a picture of happiness!” my mother exclaimed, and I didn’t like her sarcasm one bit.</p><p>I couldn’t wait to show my new doll to Tania. I counted the days until August 22nd, the day she was supposed to come back.</p><p>But Tania didn’t come on the 22nd. Nor did she come on the 23rd. I called her a million times, and even walked by her window, looking up, hoping to catch sight of her. She called me on the 25th to say that she was sick with a stomach flu. I offered to visit her, but Tania said she’d come to my place the next day. She rang the bell at nine in the morning, as we were finishing breakfast. I got out of my chair so fast that I knocked over the soft-boiled egg on my plate, spilling the yolk onto the table.</p><p>Tania had grown about an inch over the summer; she was taller than me. She’d also lost weight and got a nice tan. Her skin was now darker than her hair. My grandmother offered her some breakfast, but she said she’d just eaten. Grandmother then urged me to come back and finish my meal. I refused—I couldn’t wait any longer.</p><p>I took Tania by the elbow and dragged her toward my room. “Look, look what I’ve got,” I kept chanting.</p><p>The whole doll family was gathered in their living room. The father and the little girl on the sofa. The mother and grandmother on the chair at the table. The twins lay on the floor, because there was no other place for them.</p><p>Tania didn’t notice the father at first. She thought I was referring to the chicken coop. She approved of the chicken coop. She said, “That’s clever.”</p><p>“No!” I said, pointing to the father doll. “Look here. Look what I’ve got. It’s their father!”</p><p>Now Tania saw him. She seemed to tense all over, then she reached into the box. There was a certain stiffness to her movements that made me apprehensive. She picked the father up gingerly, slowly, and brought him close to her face. For a second, I was afraid that she was going to eat him. But she just examined him, touched his hair, stroked the felt on his hat, sniffed at his leather boots.</p><p>“It’s a boy doll,” she said in a grave tone.</p><p>“Yeah,” I said. “It’s a boy doll. It’s their father.”</p><p>She was about to put him back when she noticed that his left leg was dangling in his pants.</p><p>“It’s damaged!” she said, and I saw an expression of relief spread across her face.</p><p>“No, it’s not damaged,” I said.</p><p>“Yes, it is. It’s a cripple,” she said.</p><p>“He’s not a cripple,” I said, and reached to take the father back. She dodged away from me.</p><p>“He’s a cripple, all right. And look at that stupid smile. Is he a retard, too?”</p><p>“He’s not!” I screamed.</p><p>I tried to grab my father doll out of her hand, but she jumped away.</p><p>“Cripple and retard, cripple and retard,” she started to sing, swinging the father in her hand.</p><p>“Your father is worse!” I screamed.</p><p>She stopped singing and stared at me.</p><p>I tried to remember that ugly word my mother had used. Defitted? Defetated? Effected? I couldn’t. I had to put it in the words I knew. “He ran off! He up and went!” I said. “He doesn’t care about you! He hates you! He’s sick of you!”</p><p>Tania’s face was turning that scary beet color. I didn’t care.</p><p>“He’s never coming back!” [cartoon id="a17771"]</p><p>“You’re lying!” Tania yelled and punched me on the shoulder. I tried to hit her back, but she ducked, then lunged for the balcony door, brandishing the father doll in her hand like a trophy.</p><p>I imagined him falling nine floors down to the pavement, his dear face destroyed just like Arabella’s. I leaped at Tania, and fell to the floor on top of her, pounding her in the chest. Her body felt firm and resilient under my fists, as if it were made of durable rubber. I’d had no idea that hitting someone could feel so good. I kept pounding, even after she had released the father and started to wail. I didn’t stop until my mother and my grandmother ran into the room and pulled me off her.</p><p>My mother punished me by taking away my dolls for two months. She put all the animals into the shoebox with the people, closed the lid, and balanced it on top of the bookcase. As if it were nothing, as if it weren’t a house where a family lived! I remember crying, and counting the days until I’d get them back. But when my mother finally handed me the box I was disappointed. The dolls didn’t seem so interesting anymore. They led their quiet, uneventful lives in the shoebox. The children either slept or misbehaved. The grandmother snarled at them. The father nursed his bad hip. The mother kept losing her hair. By the end of the<span data-page="page_6"></span> year, I had stopped playing with the dolls altogether, and my grandmother gave them to the little girl next door, the one whose father had gone to the Far North.</p><p>Tania and I didn’t play together anymore. We avoided each other at school. Then, a year later, she and her mother moved, and she transferred to a different school. I didn’t see her again until the end of high school, when her mother threw a going-away party for her. Tania was moving to America. Her father had arranged for her to go to college there. I didn’t want to go to the party, but my mother insisted.</p><p>Tania had grown a whole head taller than me and acquired a strange, restless manner. She talked very fast, with fidgety gestures, and her eyes kept flickering from one object to another. She said that her father had got back in touch about two years earlier, but I couldn’t ask her any questions, because there were so many people there—and all of them wanted to talk to Tania, or kiss her, or corner her against a wall and give her useless advice. I didn’t stay at the party long, but I kept thinking about it for days. It was odd that Tania had invited me in the first place, when we hadn’t spoken for years. Apparently, she needed me, of all people, to know that her father did care about her after all.</p><p>Ten years later, when my husband and I immigrated to the U.S., I tried to look her up, but couldn’t find her. I assumed that she had changed her name. Another eight years passed, and then all of a sudden I got a message from her on Facebook. “Aren’t you Katya V. from my old school?”</p><p>I had just finalized my divorce and changed back to my maiden name. If I hadn’t done that, she wouldn’t have been able to find me.</p><p>I was aching to know what had become of her, or at least what she looked like now, but her Facebook page didn’t tell me much. She barely posted anything, and her face in the profile picture was half blocked by the child in her arms.</p><p>Tania said that she was spending the summer at her house in the Berkshires and invited me to visit.</p><p>She’d caught me at a strange moment in my life. I was about to start a two-week vacation—my first since the divorce and the first I would spend alone—but I had no idea what to do with it. Back when most of my friends were planning their summer, the pain of the divorce had been too great and the future too murky for me to commit to anything. I had assumed that I’d be too depressed to go anywhere. The protective layer I’d grown during my married years had been peeled off, leaving me completely exposed.</p><p>But when the summer finally started I found that I felt better. The idea of being on my own began to excite me. I still felt exposed, but I also felt that the exposure would help me regain some long-forgotten intensity of living. With no husband’s wishes to satisfy, I could go anywhere I wanted. Except that the nice vacation spots were already booked, and the affordable plane tickets were gone.</p><p>Tania’s invitation gave me an idea: I’d drive up to her place, visit with her, and then continue driving north. No plan, no destination—I’d just drive as far as I wanted and find somewhere to stay. I’d never done anything like this, but I felt that it was time to do things I’d never done before.</p><p>Tania sent incredibly detailed driving directions and insisted that I turn off my G.P.S. In my years of driving in the U.S., I had become addicted to my G.P.S., and I couldn’t imagine turning it off, so I decided to keep Tania’s directions in mind while listening to the G.P.S., and to follow my intuition whenever they disagreed. This strategy got me lost as soon as I ventured off the highway, but I didn’t really mind. The closer I got to Tania’s place, the more I dreaded our initial conversation. I did want to talk about our childhood, but to get there we would need to catch up first. I’d have to tell her that my mother had died. That I probably wouldn’t be able to have children. And that my husband had left me. “Up and went. Because he was sick of me.” (I guess I didn’t really understand the cruelty of those words until my divorce.) At least my career was on the right track. That was something.</p><p>“Recalculating,” the G.P.S. informed me for the twentieth time, in the face of my disobedience. It demanded that I go back to the highway, which was clearly wrong. But Tania’s directions had also stopped making sense. I decided to disregard both of them and took the prettiest road that led uphill. I realized that I hadn’t visited the countryside in years. All those quaint houses, all those barns, all those animals in pastures made me feel both nostalgic and alienated. I knew that I’d never want to live in a place like this.</p><p>At some point, I came to a fork in the road. I chose to veer to the right and continue uphill. A beautiful property came into<span data-page="page_7"></span> view: a meadow full of daisies, a little pond with a single duck, a cluster of lilac bushes, a few apple trees, an extensive vegetable garden, and, at the top of the hill, a house that looked remarkably like my old shoebox. It was painted red, with yellow awnings. I slowed down to admire the view, just as my G.P.S. reluctantly announced that I had reached my destination. I drove a few feet forward and saw the address printed on a little sign: “12 Berry Hill Road.”</p><p>As I pulled into the driveway, the front door was opened by a large woman in a flowery sundress, her blond hair fixed in a little bun. My first thought was that Tania’s mother had come to visit, but then I realized that this was Tania herself. Tania, who’d grown large and soft. When she hugged me, it felt like being smothered in a down blanket.</p><p>Within ten minutes, I understood that I needn’t have worried about having to tell her all the sad things that had happened in my life. She didn’t ask me any questions, and she didn’t let me talk. As soon as I set foot in the house, she began a never-ending tour, up and down the stairs, in and out of doors, through rooms, across halls. She didn’t even offer me a drink. I had to ask for a glass of water, and then she gave me a bottle of Evian to drink on the go.</p><p>Tania talked faster than ever, and there was no way to protect myself from the gushes of information. Post and beam. Restored and reassembled in 1993. Hemlock timber. Wooden pegs. Dyed plaster walls. Central air. Finnish sauna off the master bedroom. Japanese toilet in the guest bathroom. (After four hours in the car, I used this with great enthusiasm.) Six bedrooms wasn’t so big, she informed me. The in-laws had a twelve-bedroom in a neighboring town. Their pond was ridiculous, though. Not fit for swimming. Tania’s pond was perfect, but the kids still preferred to swim in the pool. The kids were away right now. Attending a tennis day camp.</p><p>A large framed photograph of the family graced the living-room wall above a huge, obviously antique sofa. In the picture, Tania, her husband, and their two daughters sat on that same sofa, smiling. I thought that they were smiling a little too hard. I liked the look of the older girl, though. She reminded me of the Tania I’d known as a girl.</p><p>The adult Tania took a long look at the picture. “I guess we’re happy,” she said.</p><p>“Pretty hard not to be in a house like this,” I said and bit my tongue. But, fortunately, Tania didn’t hear the sarcasm in my tone. The tour was starting to wear me out. I didn’t know what reaction she expected. Continuous admiration? Or a bitter acknowledgment of her wealth? Something like her reaction when I took her on a tour of my room twenty-eight years before? “So—you have six bedrooms? And you have antique sofas and everything? You’re rich, aren’t you?”</p><p>I was relieved when we finally left the house. But the tour wasn’t over yet. Tania led me to the garden.</p><p>Keeping a garden was such a pain, she said. Row-cropping. Draining the soil. Weeding. Aphids. Maggots. Cutworms. Beetles. Did I know how difficult it was to find a decent gardener or a decent pest man? But it was beautiful, wasn’t it? Peas. Carrots. Look at the kale. Five types of kale. Rows and rows of kale. They all enjoyed eating kale. Yes, the kids, too. Kale did wonders for their health. Simply wonders. As did eating eggs from their own chickens.</p><p>Tania led me to her pièce de résistance—a chicken coop. A spacious wooden construction that housed ten or twelve chickens. All white, all big, all well fed.</p><p>“I can’t believe you have chickens!” I said, unable to contain my laughter.</p><p>“What’s so funny?” she asked.</p><p>Tania had built herself an exact replica of my old doll house, down to the chicken coop, but she didn’t seem to see the absurdity of the situation.</p><p>“Do you remember Katania?” I asked.</p><p>“Do I remember what?”</p><p>“Katania, our country?”</p><p>She looked at me, straining to understand what I was talking about.</p><p>“Katania,” I said, “the country that we created for our dolls. Mine lived in a village and yours lived in a city.”</p><p>“Vaguely,” she said. “I remember that we got in a big fight once.”</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>“Because you wouldn’t share your dolls.”</p><p>“Right,” I said.</p><p>“I teach my kids to share.”</p><p>“Good idea,” I said, and looked at my watch. It was time for me to go, I told her.</p><p>Tania didn’t protest. She said it was a pity that I wouldn’t meet her husband and kids, but otherwise she appeared to be satisfied with my visit.</p><p>As it happened, though, I did get to take a look at her husband. I had just pulled out of the driveway when I saw a silver Lexus pulling in. A man got out of the car, and I recognized him from the photograph above the sofa. He was wearing white linen pants and a white button-down shirt. He took a big pastry box from the passenger seat and started walking toward the house.</p><p>There was something strange about his gait, but at<span data-page="page_final"></span> first I didn’t realize what it was. Then I got it: he was putting his entire weight on his right leg. He walked as if his left leg didn’t work. He walked as if it were detached at the hip. ♦</p>	Lara Vapnyar	October 14, 2013 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/10/14/katania	Books	Countries	Cripples	Cups	Defections	Doll Houses	Unnamed	First	Immigrants
Lenny Hearts Eunice	<p><em>June 1, Rome.</em></p><p>Lucky diary! Undeserving diary! From this day forward, you will travel on the greatest adventure yet undertaken by a nervous, average man sixty-nine inches in height, a hundred and sixty pounds in heft, with a slightly dangerous body-mass index of 23.6. From this day forward, you will join me on the journey toward immortality. Why “from this day forward”? Because yesterday I met Eunice Park, and she will sustain me forever. Take a long look at me, diary. What do you see? A slight man with a gray, sunken battleship of a face, curious wet eyes, a giant gleaming forehead on which a dozen cavemen could have painted something nice, a sickle of a nose perched atop a tiny puckered mouth, and, from the back, a growing bald spot whose shape perfectly replicates that of the great state of Ohio, with its capital city, Columbus, marked by a deep-brown mole. On most days I look like a CrisisNet stream of our befuddled Bipartisan Defense Secretary Rubenstein, trembling through his press conference after our troops got routed at Caracas. <em>Slight</em>. Slightness is my curse in every sense. A so-so body in a world where only an incredible one will do. A body at the chronological age of thirty-nine already racked by too much LDL cholesterol, too much ACTH hormone, too much of everything that dooms the heart, sunders the liver, explodes all hope.</p><p>A week ago, before Eunice gave me reason to live, you wouldn’t have noticed me, diary. A week ago, I did not exist. A week ago, at a restaurant in Rome, I took out my dated äppärät, with its retro walnut finish and its dusty screen blinking with slow data, trying to get a read on whether there were any High Net Worth Individuals in the room—a last chance to find some new clients for my boss, Joshie, after having uncovered a grand total of <em>one</em> during the whole year I’d spent in Italy trying to foist our Product on unreceptive rich Eurotrash. I approached a potential client, a classically attractive High Net Worth Individual. He looked up from his wintry <em>bollito misto</em>, looked right past me, looked back down at the boiled lovemaking of his seven meats and seven vegetable sauces, looked back up, looked right past me <em>again</em>. It was clear that for a member of upper society to even remotely notice me I would have to first fire a flaming arrow into a dancing moose or be kicked in the testicles by a head of state.</p><p>And yet Lenny Abramov, your humble diarist, your small nonentity, will live forever. As the Life Lovers Outreach Coördinator (Grade G) of the Post-Human Services Division of the Staatling-Wapachung Corporation, I will be the first to partake of eternal life.</p><p>During my year in Rome, I kept a paperback next to my bed: “The Unbearable Lightness of Being,” of course. Every morning I reread page 8 and the sentences I had underlined as a moody, un-laid teen-ager already anticipating his deathbed: “What happens but once . . . might as well not have happened at all. If we have only one life to live, we might as well not have lived at all.” Next to this I had written in shaded teen-aged block letters: “<em class="small">EUROPEAN CYNICISM</em> <em class="small">OR</em> <em class="small">VERY SCARY TRUTH</em>???” Perhaps it was this book that had first launched my search for immortality. Joshie himself once said to a very important client, “Eternal life is the only life that matters. All else is just a moth circling the light.” He hadn’t noticed me standing by the door to his office. I had returned to my desk in tears, feeling abandoned to nothingness, mothlike, yet stunned by Joshie’s unusual lyricism. The part about the moth, I mean.</p><p>Here’s how I look at it. Money equals life. By my estimate, even the preliminary beta-dechronification treatments—for example, the insertion of SmartBlood to regulate my ridiculous cardiovascular system—would run three million yuan per year. With each second I have spent in Rome, lustily minding the architecture, drinking and eating enough daily glucose to kill a Cuban sugarcane farmer, I have been paving the toll road to my own demise.</p><p>But don’t bury me yet, judgmental diary. A new Lenny heart beats more convincingly than the old one. Eunice Park will save me. You just watch.</p><p>Last night, the last night of my Euro sabbatical, I told myself, Remember this, Lenny. Develop a sense of nostalgia for something, or you’ll never figure out what’s important. Remember how you met Eunice at your last orgiastic Roman party, how you rescued her from what’s-his-face, the diabetic American sculptor with the Beatlesque mop and stubby teeth, how you dragged that nano-sized woman into the night with you.</p><p>But by the end of said night I remembered very little. Let’s just say that I drank. Drank out of fear (she was so cruel). Drank out of happiness (she was so beautiful). Drank until my teeth and my whole mouth had turned a dark ruby red and the pungency of my breath and perspiration betrayed my passing years. And she drank, too. One <em>mezzolitro</em> of the local swill became a full <em>litro</em>, and then two <em>litri</em> and then a bottle of something possibly Sardinian but in any case thicker than bull’s blood.</p><p>Enormous plates of food were needed to mop up<span data-page="page_2"></span> this overindulgence. We thoughtfully chewed on the pig jowls of the <em>bucatini all’amatriciana</em>, slurped up a plate of spaghetti with spicy eggplant, and picked apart a rabbit practically drowning in olive oil. I knew I would miss all this when I got back to New York, even the horrible fluorescent lighting that brought out my age—the wrinkles around my eyes, the single long highway and three county roads that run across my forehead, testaments to many sleepless nights spent worrying about unredeemed pleasures and my carefully hoarded income, but mostly about death.</p><p>I told her I didn’t want to leave Rome now that I had met her.</p><p>She told me I was a nerd, but a nerd who made her laugh.</p><p>I told her I wanted to do more than make her laugh.</p><p>She told me I should be thankful for what I had.</p><p>I told her she should move to New York with me.</p><p>She told me she was probably a lesbian.</p><p>I told her my work was my life, but I still had room for love.</p><p>She told me love was out of the question.</p><p>I told her my parents were Russian immigrants who lived in New York.</p><p>She told me hers were Korean immigrants who lived in Fort Lee, New Jersey.</p><p>I told her my father was a retired janitor who liked to go fishing.</p><p>She told me her father was a podiatrist who liked to punch his wife and two daughters in the face.</p><p>“Oh,” I said. Eunice Park shrugged and excused herself. On my plate, the rabbit’s little dead heart hung from within his rib cage. I put my head in my hands and wondered if I should just throw some euros down on the table and walk out.</p><p>But soon enough I was heading down ivy-draped Via Giulia, my arm around Eunice Park’s fragrant, boyish frame. She was seemingly in good spirits, promising me a kiss, then chastising my poor Italian. She was shyness and giggles, freckles in the moonlight and drunken, immature cries of “Shut up, Lenny!” and “You’re such an idiot!” I noticed she had released her hair from the bun’s captivity and that it was dark and endless and thick as twine. She was twenty-four years old.</p><p>My apartment could accommodate no more than a cheap twin-size mattress and a fully opened suitcase, brimming with books. (“My Text-major friends at Elderbird used to call those things ‘doorstops,’ ” she told me.) We kissed, lazily, like it was nothing, then roughly, like we meant it. There were some problems. Eunice Park wouldn’t take off her bra (“I have absolutely no chest”), and I was too drunk and scared to develop an erection. But I didn’t want intercourse anyway. The next morning, she was kind enough to help me repack my suitcase, which refused to close without her help. “That’s not how you do it,” she said, when she saw me brushing my teeth. She made me stick out my tongue and roughly scraped its purple surface with the toothbrush. “There,” she said. “Better.”</p><p>During the taxi ride to the airport I felt the triple pangs of being happy and lonely and needy all at once. She had made me wash my lips and chin thoroughly to obliterate every trace of her, but Eunice Park’s alkaline tang remained on the tip of my nose. I made great sniffing motions in the air, trying to capture her essence, thinking already of how I would bait her to New York, make her my life, my life eternal. I touched my expertly brushed teeth and petted the flurry of gray hairs sticking out from beneath my shirt collar, which she had thoroughly examined in the morning’s weak early light. “Cute,” she had said. And then, with a child’s sense of wonder, “You’re old, Len.”</p><p><em>June 1: From the GlobalTeens account of Eunice Park.</em></p><p><em>Euni-Tard Abroad to Grillbitch.</em></p><p>Hi, Precious Panda!</p><p>So, guess what? I met the cutest guy in Rome. He is exactly my type, tall, kind of German-looking, very preppie, but not an asshole. Giovanna set me up with him—he’s in Rome working for LandO’LakesGMFordCredit! So I go to meet him in the Piazza Navona (remember Image Class? Navona’s the one with all the Tritons) and he’s sitting there having a cappuccino and streaming “Chronicles of Narnia”! Remember we streamed that in Catholic? So adorable. His name is Ben, which is pretty gay, but he was <em>so nice</em> and so smart. He took me to look at some Caravaggios and then he kind of like touched my butt a little and then we went to one of Giovanna’s parties and made out. There were all these Italian girls in Onionskin jeans staring at us, like I was stealing one of their white guys or something. I fucking hate that. If they mention my “almond eyes” one more time, I swear. Anyway, <em>I need your advice</em> because he called yesterday and asked if I wanted to go up to Lucca with him next week and I was playing hard to get and said no. But I’m going to call him and say yes tomorrow! <em>What should I do</em>? <em>Help!!!</em></p><p>P.S. I met this old, gross guy at a party yesterday and we got really drunk and I sort of let him go down on me. There was another even older guy,<span data-page="page_3"></span> this sculptor, trying to get in my pants, so I figured, you know, the lesser evil. Ugh, I’m turning into you!!!!! The first old guy took me to dinner at this restaurant, da Tonino, which was like O.K. He was nice, kind of dorky, although he thinks he’s so Media cause he works in biotech or something. And he had the grossest feet, bunions and this gigantic heel spur that sticks out like he’s got a thumb glued to his foot. I know, I’m thinking like my dad. Anyway, he brushes his teeth all wrong, so I had to <em class="small">SHOW A GROWN MAN HOW TO USE A TOOTHBRUSH</em>!!!!! What is wrong with my life, Precious Panda?</p><p><em>June 4: Leonardo Dabramovinci to Euni-Tard Abroad.</em></p><p>Oh, hi there. It’s Lenny Abramov. You might remember me from our little time in Rome. Thanks for brushing my teeth! Hee-hee. So, anyway, just got back to the U.S. of A. I’ve been practicing my abbreviations. I think you said “<em class="small">ROFLAARP</em>” in Rome. Does that mean “Rolling on Floor Looking at Addictive Rodent Pornography”? See, I’m not that old! Anyway, been thinking about you. Coming to N.Y.C. anytime soon? You’ve got a place to stay here. I’ve got a nice apartment all set up, seven hundred and forty square feet, balcony, view of downtown. Can’t compete with da Tonino, but I make a pretty mean roasted eggplant. I can even sleep on the couch if you want me to. Call or write anytime. It was really, really, <em>really</em> great to meet you. I’m committing the constellation of your freckles to memory as I write this (hope that doesn’t make you uncomfortable).</p><p>Love,</p><p>Leonard</p><p><em>June 6, New York.</em></p><p>Well, I’m back! New York, New York. The Motherland. The dense stretch of humanity where your scrappy diarist, Lenny Abramov, was birthed to an anxious immigrant woman and her unhappy husband. Less than a week off the plane, and already so much important work to be done. My new way of thinking is this—if I’m to live forever, I have to make people love me. First up, boss man Joshie. I’ve got to show Joshie that I still matter at the workplace, that I’m not just a teacher’s pet but a Creative Thinker and Content Provider. I have to make excuses for my poor performance in Europe. I have to get a raise and lower spending. I have to save money for initial dechronification treatments. I have to double my life span in twenty years and then just keep going at it exponentially until I gain the momentum to achieve Indefinite Life Extension. Secondly, Eunice. Even if she’s far away, I have to think of her as a potential partner. I have to meditate on her freckles and make myself feel loved by her so as to lower stress levels and feel less alone. Then I have to beg her to come to New York and let her become, as quickly as possible, reluctant lover, cautious companion, pretty young wife.</p><p>First order of business when I got back: to celebrate what I already have. I began with the seven hundred and forty square feet that form my share of Manhattan Island. I live in the last middle-class stronghold in the city, high atop a red-brick ziggurat that a Jewish garment workers’ union erected on the banks of the East River back in the days when Jews sewed clothes for a living. Say what you will, these ugly co-ops are full of authentic old people who have real stories to tell (although these stories are often meandering and hard to follow; e.g., who on earth was this guy “Dillinger”?).</p><p>Then I celebrated my Wall of Books. I counted the volumes on my twenty-foot-long modernist bookshelf to make sure that none had been misplaced or used as kindling by my subtenant. “You’re my sacred ones,” I told the books. “No one but me still cares about you. But I’m going to keep you with me forever. And one day I’ll make you important again.” I thought about the terrible calumny of the new generation: that books smell. And yet, in preparation for the eventual arrival of Eunice Park, I decided to be safe and sprayed some Pine-Sol Wild Flower Blast in the vicinity of my tomes, fanning the atomized juices in the direction of their spines.</p><p>I celebrated the difficult-to-assemble outdoor table (one leg still too short) on my balcony and had a pretty awful non-Roman coffee <em>al fresco</em> while looking out at the busy skyline of the Borrower-Spender-Financial-Residential Complex in lower Manhattan, some twenty blocks away from me, military and civilian choppers streaming past the overblown spire of the Freedom Tower and all that other glittering downtown hoo-ha. I celebrated the low-rise housing projects crowding my immediate view, the so-called Vladeck Houses, which stand in red-brick solidarity with my own co-ops, not exactly proud of themselves, but resigned and necessary, their thousands of residents primed for summer warmth and, if I may speculate, summer love.</p><p>With love in mind, I decided to celebrate the season. I slapped on a pair of white linen pants, a speckled Penguin shirt, and some comfy Malaysian sneakers, so that I easily resembled many of the nonagenarians in my building. My co-op is part of a <em class="small">NORC</em>, or Naturally Occurring Retirement Community—a kind of instant Florida<span data-page="page_4"></span> for those too frail or too poor to relocate to Boca in time for their death. Surrounded by shrunken <em class="small">NORC</em>ers in motorized wheelchairs with their Jamaican caregivers, I counted the daily carnage on the Death Board by the elevators. Five residents of the <em class="small">NORC</em> had passed in the last two days alone. I guess you could say that while admiring those authentic old people I also hated them. Hated them for giving up on life, for letting the waves come and recede, their withered bodies in tow.</p><p>In my trendy old man’s getup I ambled with easy grace down Grand Street, stepping off each curb with the profound “oy” that is the call-and-response of my neighborhood. I celebrated the teen-aged mothers from the Vladeck Houses tending to their children’s boo-boos (“A bee touched me, Mommy!”). I relished hearing language actually being spoken by children. Overblown verbs, explosive nouns, beautifully bungled prepositions. Language, not data. How long would it be before these kids retreated into the dense clickety-clack äppärät world of their absorbed mothers and missing fathers? Then I caught sight of the wooden telegraph poles that now lined the streets.</p><p>I’d heard about the Credit Poles going up when I was in Rome. Their old-fashioned appearance was obviously meant to evoke a sturdier time in our nation’s history, except for the little L.E.D. counters at eye level that registered your Credit ranking as you walked by. Atop the poles, American Restoration Authority signs billowed in several languages. In the Chinatown sections of East Broadway, the signs read, in English and Chinese, “America Celebrates Its Spenders!,” and showed a cartoon of a miserly ant happily running toward a mountain of wrapped Christmas presents. In the Latino stretch of Madison Street, they read, in English and Spanish, “Save It for a Rainy Day, Huevón,” with a frowning grasshopper in a zoot suit revealing his empty pockets. Alternating signs read, in all three languages:</p><p>The Boat Is Full.</p><p>Avoid deportation.</p><p>Latinos save.</p><p>Chinese spend.</p><p><em class="small">ALWAYS</em> keep your Credit ranking within limits.</p><p><em class="small">AMERICAN RESTORATION AUTHORITY</em></p><p>“Together We’ll Surprise the World!”</p><p>I felt the perfunctory liberal chill at seeing entire races of human beings so summarily reduced and stereotyped but was also voyeuristically interested in seeing people’s Credit rankings. The young Latina mothers, and even a profligate teen-aged Hasid puffing down the street, were showing red blinking scores below 900, and I worried for them.</p><p>An armored personnel carrier bearing the insignia of the New York Army National Guard was parked astride a man-size pothole at the intersection of Essex and Delancey, a roof-mounted .50calibre Browning machine gun rotating a hundred and eighty degrees, back and forth, like a retarded metronome, along the busy but peaceable Lower East Side streetscape. Traffic was frozen all across Delancey Street. Silent traffic, for no one dared to use a horn against the military vehicle. The street corner emptied around me until I stood alone staring down the barrel of the gun like an idiot. I lifted up my hands in panic and directed my feet to scram.</p><p>My celebrations were turning sour. In front of a recently shuttered Bowery scones-and-libations establishment called PoverTea I found a cab and took it to the Upper East Side lair of my second father.</p><p>The Post-Human Services Division of the Staatling-Wapachung Corporation is housed in a former Moorish-style synagogue near Fifth Avenue, a tired-looking building dripping with arabesques, kooky buttresses, and other crap that brings to mind a lesser Gaudi. Joshie got it at auction for a mere eighty thousand dollars when the congregation folded after being bamboozled by some kind of Jewish pyramid scheme years ago. I have worked for Joshie since graduating from N.Y.U., that indispensable local educator of bright enough women and men. Back then Post-Human Services used to be a so-called “flat organization,” without titles or hierarchies, its organic, odorous young workers obsessed with but one goal—the total annihilation of death. After the mighty Staatling-Wapachung Corporation bought Joshie out for a grotesque sum of money, everyone was given a rank, the least enthusiastic among us simply told to go home.</p><p>The first thing I noticed upon my return was the familiar smell. Heavy use of a special hypoallergenic organic air freshener is encouraged at Post-Human Services, because the scent of immortality is complex. The supplements, the diet, the constant shedding of blood and piercing of skin for various physical tests, the fear of the metallic components found in most deodorants make a curious array of post-mortal odors, of which “sardine breath” is the most benign.</p><p>With one or two exceptions, I haven’t made any work-time buddies at Post-Human Services since I turned thirty. It’s not easy being friends with some twenty-two-year-old who cries over his fasting blood-glucose level or sends out a group teen with his adrenal stress index and a smiley face. A graffito in the bathroom that reads “Lenny Abramov’s insulin levels are whack” is evidence of a certain undeniable atmosphere of one-upmanship, which, in turn, raises the cortisol levels associated with stress and encourages cellular breakdown.</p><p>Still, when I walked through the door I expected to recognize <em>someone</em>. The synagogue’s gilded main sanctuary was filled with young men and women<span data-page="page_5"></span> dressed with angry post-college disregard but projecting from somewhere between their eyes the message that they were the personification of that old Whitney Houston number—they, the children, were <em>de facto</em> the future.</p><p>The ark where the Torahs were customarily stashed had been taken out, and in its place hung five gigantic Solari schedule boards that Joshie had rescued from various Italian train stations. Instead of the <em>arrivi</em> and <em>partenze</em> of trains pulling in and out of Florence or Milan, the flip board displayed the names of Post-Human Services employees, along with the results of our latest physicals, our methylation and homocysteine levels, our testosterone and estrogen, our fasting insulin and triglycerides, and, most important, our “mood + stress indicators,” which were always supposed to read “positive/playful/ready to contribute” but which, with enough input from competitive co-workers, could be changed to “one moody betch today” or “not a team playa this month.” On this particular day the black-and-white flaps were turning madly, the letters and numbers mutating—a droning <em>ticka-ticka-ticka-ticka</em>—to form new words and figures. Disturbingly enough, several of my colleagues, including my fellow-Russian the brilliantly manic-depressive Vasily Greenberg, were marked by the dreaded legend “Train Cancelled.”</p><p>As for me, I wasn’t even listed.</p><p>Finally I heard the words “Rhesus Monkey.” Joshie’s nickname for me! Someone had recognized my special relationship to Joshie, the fact that I used to be someone around here.</p><p>It was my darling Kelly Nardl. A supple, low-slung girl my age whom I would be terminally attracted to if I could stand to spend my life within three metres of her non-deodorized animal scent. She welcomed me with a kiss on both cheeks, as if she were the one just returned from Europe.</p><p>“Hey,” I said. “Vasily Greenberg’s train got cancelled? He played the guitar and spoke a little Arabic. He was so ‘ready to contribute’ when he wasn’t totally depressed.”</p><p>“He turned forty last month,” Kelly said, with a sigh. “Didn’t make quotas.”</p><p>“I’m almost forty, too,” I said. “And why isn’t my name up on the Boards?”</p><p>Kelly didn’t say anything. We had once shared an entire bottle of wine, or “resveratrol,” as we Post-Humans like to call it, at a tapas bar in Brooklyn and after walking her to her violent Bushwick tenement I’d wondered if I could one day fall in love with a woman so unobtrusively, compulsively decent. (Answer: no.)</p><p>“Maybe I’ll go to my desk,” I said to Kelly.</p><p>“Honey,” she said. “You don’t have a desk. I mean, someone’s taken it. This new kid from Brown-Yonsei. <em>Darryl</em>, I think.”</p><p>“What do I do?” I whispered.</p><p>“It would help,” she said, “if you looked a little younger. Take care of yourself. Go to the Eternity Lounge. Put some Lexin DC concentrate under your eyes.”</p><p>The lounge was crammed full of smelly young people checking their äppäräti or leaning back on couches with their faces to the ceiling, de-stressing, breathing right.</p><p>“Hi,” I said to anyone who would listen.</p><p>I went to the mini-bar where unsweetened green tea was dispensed, along with alkalized water and two hundred and thirty-one daily nutritionals. “Just got back from a year in Roma,” I said, trying to pump the bravado in my voice. “All carbs over there. Need to stock up on the essentials like a cuh-<em>razy</em> person. Good to be back, guys!”</p><p>Silence. But as I turned again to the supplements someone said, “What’s shaking, Rhesus Monkey?”</p><p>It was a kid with a small outbreak of a mustache and a gray bodysuit with the words “<em class="small">SUK DIK</em>” stencilled across the breast, some kind of red bandanna strung around his neck. He was probably Darryl from Brown, the one who had taken my desk. He couldn’t have been more than twenty-five. I smiled at him, looked at my äppärät, sighed as if I had too much work ahead of me, and then casually headed for the door.</p><p>“Where you going, Rhesus?” he asked, blocking my exit with his scraggly, tight-butted body, shoving his äppärät in my face, the rich organic smell of him clouding my nostrils. “Don’t you want to do some blood work for us, buddy? I’m seeing triglycerides clocking in at one thirty-five. That’s <em>before</em> you ran away to Europe like a little bitch.” There was hooting in the background, the spectators clearly enjoying this toxic banter.</p><p>I backed away, mumbling, “One thirty-five is still within the range.” There was more laughter, the shine of hairless hands bearing sleek technological pendants full of right data. Two and a half heartbeats later, the hooting abruptly ceased. The boisterous crowd was parting, the “<em class="small">SUK DIK</em>” warriors slinking away.</p><p>And there he was. Younger than before. The initial dechronification treatments, the beta treatments, as we called them, already coursing through him. His face unlined and harmoniously still, except for that thick nose, which twitched uncontrollably at times, some muscle group gone haywire. His ears stood on either side of his shorn head like two sentinels.</p><p>Joshie Goldmann never revealed his age, but I surmised that he was in his late sixties—a sixty-something man with a mustache as black as eternity. In restaurants, he was sometimes mistaken for my handsomer brother. We shared the same unappreciated jumble of meaty lips and thick eyebrows and chests that barrelled forward like a terrier’s, but that’s where the resemblance ended. Because when Joshie looked at you, when he lowered his<span data-page="page_6"></span> gaze at you, the heat would rise in your cheeks and you’d find yourself oddly, irrevocably, present.</p><p>“Oh, Leonard,” he said, sighing and shaking his head. “Those guys giving you a hard time? Poor Rhesus. Come on. Let’s talk.” I shyly followed him as he walked upstairs (no elevators, <em>never</em>) to his office. He ran his hand through the fullness of hair at my nape and turned my head around. “So much gray,” he said.</p><p>What had Eunice told me in one of our last moments together? <em>You’re old</em>, <em>Len</em>.</p><p>“It’s the pasta carbs,” I stammered. “And the stressors of Italian life. Believe it or not, it’s not easy over there when you’re living on an American’s salary—”</p><p>“You need to detoxify, Len.”</p><p>“I’m going to drink fifteen cups of alkalized water a day,” I said.</p><p>“Your male-pattern baldness worries me.”</p><p>I laughed. I actually said “Ha-ha.” “It worries me, too, Grizzly Bear,” I said.</p><p>“I’m not talking aesthetics here. All that Russian-Jewish testosterone is being turned right into dihydrotestosterone. That’s killer stuff. Prostate cancer down the road. You’ll need at least eight hundred milligrams of saw palmetto a day. What’s wrong, Rhesus? You look like you’re going to cry.”</p><p>But I just wanted him to take care of me some more. Joshie has always told the Post-Human Services staff to keep a diary, to remember who we were, because at every moment our brains and synapses are being rebuilt and rewired with maddening disregard for our personalities, so that each year, each month, each day we transform into different people, utterly unfaithful iterations of our original selves, of the drooling kids in the sandbox. But not me. I am still a facsimile of my early childhood. I am still looking for a loving dad to lift me up and brush the sand off my ass, as English, calm and hurtless, falls from his lips. Why couldn’t I be raised by Joshie? “I think I’m in love with this girl,” I sputtered.</p><p>“Talk to me.”</p><p>“She’s super young. Super healthy. Asian. Life expectancy—very high.”</p><p>“I <em>love</em> love,” Joshie said. “It’s great for pH, ACTH, LDL, whatever ails you. As long as it’s a good, <em>positive</em> love, without suspicion or hostility. Now, what you’ve got to do is make this healthy Asian girl need <em>you</em> the way you need <em>me</em>.”</p><p>“Don’t let me die, Joshie,” I said. “I need the dechronification treatments. Why isn’t my name up on the Boards?”</p><p>Joshie was silent.</p><p>“I’m sorry if I let you down by going to Rome for so long,” I near-whispered. “I thought maybe I could understand my parents better if I lived in Europe. Spent some time thinking about immortality in a really old place. Read some books. Got some thoughts down.”</p><p>Joshie turned away from me. From this angle, I could see another side to him, the faint gray stubble protruding from his perfect egg of a chin, the slight intimations that not all of him could be reverse-engineered into immortality. Yet.</p><p>“Those thoughts, those books—they <em>are</em> the problem, Rhesus,” he said. “You have to stop thinking and start selling. That’s why all those young whizzes in the Eternity Lounge want to shove a carb-filled macaroon up your ass. And who can blame them, Lenny? You remind them of death. You remind them of a different, earlier version of our species. Don’t get pissed at me now. Reading. Writing. The humanities. It’s the Fallacy of Merely Existing. F.M.E. There’ll be plenty of time to ponder and write and act out later. Right now you’ve got to <em>sell to live</em>.”</p><p><em>June 11: Euni-Tard Abroad to Grillbitch.</em></p><p>Hi, Precious Panda,</p><p>I know you’re in Tahoe so I don’t want to bother you, but things have gotten really bad with my dad and I think I’m coming home. Going to Rome was <em>such</em> a mistake. It’s like the further I am from him the more he thinks he can get away with. I don’t know if I can handle Fort Lee, but I was thinking of crashing in New York and going over there on weekends. Remember that girl you were friends with, the one with the really old-school perm, Joy Lee or something? Does she have a place for me to crash? I don’t really know anyone in N.Y.—everyone’s in L.A. or abroad. I think I might have to stay over at that old guy Lenny’s house. He keeps sending me these long teens about how much he loves my freckles and how he’s going to cook me an eggplant.</p><p>I broke up with Ben. It was too much. He is so beautiful physically, so smart and such a rising star in Credit that I am completely intimidated by him. I can never reveal who I really am to him because he would just vomit. It’s so sad. I’ve been crying for days now. Crying over my family and crying over Ben. God, I’m sorry, Precious Panda. I’m such a downer.</p><p>The weird thing is I’ve been thinking about Lenny, the old guy. I know he’s gross physically, but there’s something sweet about him and honestly I need to be taken care of, too. I feel safe with him because he is so not my ideal and I feel like I can be myself because I’m not in love with him. When we were walking down this pretty<span data-page="page_7"></span> street in Rome I noticed Lenny’s shirt was buttoned all wrong, and I just reached over and rebuttoned it. I just wanted to help him be less of a dork. Isn’t that a form of love, too? And when he was talking to me at dinner, usually I listen to everything a guy says and try to prepare a response, but with him I just stopped listening after a while and looked at the way his lips moved, the foam on his lips and on his dorky stubble, because he was so <em>earnest</em> in the way he needed to tell me things. And I thought, Wow, you’re like what Prof. Margaux in Assertiveness Class used to call “a real human being.” I don’t know. I keep going back and forth on him. Sometimes I’m like no way, it’s never going to work, I’m just not attracted to him. But then I think of him going down on me until he could barely breathe, the poor thing, and the way I could just close my eyes and pretend we were both other people.</p><p><em>June 11, New York.</em></p><p>God, I miss her. No messages from my Euny yet, no reply to my entreaty to move here and let me take care of her with garlicky carcasses of eggplant, with my grown man’s practiced affections, with what’s left of my bank account after my Roman sojourn and my demotion at work. But I’m persevering until the dreaded “Dear Lenny” letter pops up on GlobalTeens and she runs off with some hot Credit or Media guy, some mindless jerk so taken with her looks he won’t even recognize how much this miniature woman in front of him is in need of consolation and repair.</p><p>Speaking of money, I went to my H.S.B.C. on East Broadway, where a pretty Dominican girl with a set of dying teeth gave me a rundown on how my financial instruments were performing. In a word, shittily.</p><p>My AmericanMorning portfolio, even though it was pegged to the yuan, had lost ten per cent of its value, because, unbeknownst to me, the idiot asset managers had stuck the failing ColgatePalmoliveYum!BrandViacomCredit albatross into the mix, and my low-risk <em class="small">BRIC</em> (Brazil, Russia, India, China)-<em class="small">A</em>-<em class="small">BRAC</em> High-Performing Nations Fund had registered only three-per-cent growth because of the April unrest near Putingrad and the impact of America’s invasion of Venezuela on the Brazilian economy. “I feel like I’m going to shit a <em class="small">BRIC</em>,” I told Maria Abriella, my account representative.</p><p>I was <em>hemorrhaging</em> funds. I turned away from Ms. Abriella’s beautiful seagull-shaped lips as if slapped, and let death wash over me, the corned-beef smell of my damp neck giving way to an old man’s odor rising from my thighs and armpits like steam, and then to the final past-due stench of the Arizona hospice years, an orderly swabbing me down with detergent as if I were some sickly elephant.</p><p>In more positive news, I think I’m doing O.K. on the Joshie front. The first week back at Post-Human Services is over and nothing terrible happened. I haven’t been asked to do any Intakes yet, but I’ve spent the week hanging out in the Eternity Lounge fiddling with my pebbly new äppärät 7.5, with RateMe Plus technology, which I now proudly wear, pendant style, around my neck, downloading all my fears and hopes in front of my young nemeses, talking about how my parents’ love for me ran too hot and too cold, how I want and need Eunice Park even though she’s so much prettier than I deserve—basically, trying to show these open-source young’uns just how much data an old “intro” geezer like me is willing to share. So far, I’m getting shouts of “Gross” and “Sick” and “<em class="small">TIMATOV</em>,” which I’ve learned means “Think I’m About to Openly Vomit,” but I also found out that Darryl, the guy with the “<em class="small">SUK DIK</em>” bodysuit and the red bandanna, has been posting nice things about me on his GlobalTeens stream called “101 People We Need to Feel Sorry For.” Also, I’ve spent an entire week without reading any books or talking about them too loudly. I’m learning to worship my new äppärät’s screen, the colorful pulsating mosaic of it, the fact that it knows every last stinking detail about the world, while my books know only the minds of their authors.</p><p><em>June 13: Leonardo Dabramovinci to Euni-Tard Abroad.</em></p><p>Oh, hi there. It’s Lenny Abramov. Again. I’m sorry to be bothering you. I teened you a little while back and I didn’t hear from you. So I guess you’re busy and there must be all these annoying guys bothering you all the time and I don’t want to be another dork who sends you glad tidings every minute. Anyway, I just wanted to warn you that I was on my friend’s stream called “The Noah Weinberg Show!” and I was really really <em>wasted</em> and I said all these things about your freckles and how we had <em>bucatini all</em>’<em>amatriciana</em> together at da Tonino and about how I pictured us reading books to each other one day.</p><p>Eunice, I am so sorry to drag your name through the mud like this. I just got carried away and was feeling pretty sad because I miss you and wish we could keep in touch more. I keep thinking about that night we spent in<span data-page="page_8"></span> Rome, about every minute of it, and I guess it’s become like this foundation myth for me. So I’m trying to think about other things, like my job/financial situation, which is very complicated right now, and my parents, who are not as difficult as yours, but let’s just say we’re not a happy family, either. God, I don’t know why I just constantly want to open up to you. Again, I’m sorry if I embarrassed you with that ridiculous stream and with the stuff about you reading books.</p><p>(Still) Your Friend (hopefully),</p><p>Lenny</p><p><em>June 14: Euni-Tard Abroad to Leonardo Dabramovinci.</em></p><p>O.K., Leonard. Fire up that eggplant. I think I’m coming to New York. It’s “Arrivederci, Roma” for this girl. Sorry I’ve been out of touch for so long. I’ve been sort of thinking about you, too, and I really look forward to staying with you for a little while. You’re a very sweet and funny guy, Len. But I want you to know that my life blows major testes these days. I just broke up with this guy who was really my type, stuff with my parents, blah, blah, blah. So I may not always be the best company and I may not always treat you right. In other words, if you get sick of me, just throw me out on the curb. That’s what people do. Ha-ha-ha!</p><p>I’ll send you the flight info as soon as I can. You don’t have to pick me up or anything. Just tell me where to go.</p><p>I hope this doesn’t make you uncomfortable, Lenny Abramov, but my freckles really miss you.</p><p>Eunice</p><p>P.S. Have you been brushing like I showed you? It’s good for you and cuts down on bad breath.</p><p>P.P.S. I thought you were pretty cute on your friend Noah’s stream but you should really try to get off “101 People We Need to Feel Sorry For.” That guy with the “<em class="small">SUK DIK</em>” overalls is just being cruel to you. You are not a “greasy old schlub,” whatever that means, Lenny. You should stand up for yourself.</p><p><em>June 18, New York.</em></p><p>Oh my God, oh my God, Oh My God! She’s here. Eunice Park is in New York. Eunice Park is in my apartment! Eunice Park is sitting <em>next to me</em> on my couch while I’m writing this. Eunice Park: a tiny fragment of a human being in purple leggings, pouting at something terrible I may have done, anger in her wrinkled forehead, the rest of her absorbed by her äppärät, checking out expensive stuff on AssLuxury. I am close to her. I am surreptitiously smelling the garlic on her breath, diary. I’m smelling a lunch of Malaysian anchovies, and I think I’m about to have a heart attack. Oh, what’s wrong with me? Everything, sweet diary. Everything is wrong with me, and I am the happiest man alive!</p><p>When she teened me that she was coming to N.Y.C., I rushed out to the corner bodega and asked for an eggplant. They said they had to order it on their äppärät, so I waited twelve hours by the door, and when it came my hands were shaking so badly I couldn’t do anything with it. I just stuck it in the freezer (by accident) and then went out on the balcony and started to weep. From joy, of course!</p><p>On the morning of the first day of my real life, I threw out the frozen eggplant and put on my cleanest, most conservative cotton shirt, which became a monsoon of nervous sweat before I even got to the door. To dry off a little and gain perspective, I sat down, the way my parents always sat down before a long trip to pray for a safe journey in their primitive Russian way. “Lenny!” I said aloud. “You are not going to screw this up. You’ve been given a chance to help the most beautiful woman in the world. You must be good, Lenny. You must not think of yourself at all. Only of this little creature before you. Then you will be helped in turn. If you don’t pull this off, if you hurt this poor girl in any way, you will not be worthy of immortality. But if you harness her warm little body to yours and make her smile, if you show her that adult love can overcome childhood pain, then both of you will be shown the kingdom. Joshie may slam the door on you, may watch your heartbeat stutter to a stop in some public-hospital bed, but how could anyone deny Eunice Park? How could any god wish her less than eternal youth?”</p><p>I wanted to meet Eunice at J.F.K., but it turns out that you can’t even get close to the airport without a plane ticket anymore. The cabbie left me at the third American Restoration Authority checkpoint on the Van Wyck, where the National Guard had set up a greeting area, a twenty-foot-high camouflaged tarp beneath which a crowd of poor middle-class folk huddled in anticipation of their relatives. I almost missed her flight because a part of the Williamsburg Bridge had collapsed, and we spent an hour trying to turn around on Delancey Street next to a hasty new A.R.A. sign that said “Together We’ll Repare [sic] This Bridge.”</p><p>I<span data-page="page_9"></span> waited under the tarp for the UnitedContinentalDeltAmerican bus, pacing nervously until the men with guns began to look at me funny, then retreated into a makeshift Retail space by a Dumpster where I bought some wilting roses and a three-hundred-dollar bottle of champagne. My poor Eunice looked so tired when she huffed off the bus with her many bags that I nearly tackled her in a rejuvenating embrace, but I was careful not to make a scene, waving my roses and champagne at the armed men to prove that I had enough Credit to afford Retail and then kissed her passionately on one cheek (she smelled of flight and moisturizer), then on the straight, thin, oddly non-Asian nose, then the other cheek, then back to the nose, then once more the first cheek, following the curve of freckles backward and forward, marking her nose like a bridge to be crossed twice. The champagne bottle fell out of my hands, but, whatever futuristic garbage it was made of, it didn’t break.</p><p>Confronted with this kind of crazy love, Eunice didn’t withdraw, nor did she return my ardor. She smiled at me with those full purple lips of hers and those tired young eyes, abashed, and made a motion with her arms to indicate that the bags were heavy. They were, diary. They were the heaviest bags I’ve ever carried. The spiky heels of ladies’ shoes kept stabbing my abdomen and a metal tin of unknown provenance, round and hard, bruised my hip.</p><p>The cab ride passed in near-silence, both of us a little ashamed of the situation, each probably feeling guilty about something (my relative power; her youth), and mindful of the fact that we had spent less than a day together in total and that our commonalities had yet to be determined.</p><p>She was disappointed by my apartment, by how far it was from the F line and how ugly the buildings were. “Looks like I’ll get some exercise walking to the train,” she said. “Ha-ha.” This was what her generation liked to add to the end of sentences, a kind of nervous tic. “Ha-ha.”</p><p>“I’m really glad you’re here, Eunice,” I said, trying to keep everything I said both clear and honest. “I really missed you. I mean, it’s kind of weird . . .”</p><p>“I missed you, too, nerd face,” she said.</p><p>That single sentence hung in the air between us, the insult wedded to the intimacy. She had clearly surprised herself, and she didn’t know what to do, whether to add a “Ha!” or a “Ha-ha” or just shrug it off. I decided to take the initiative and sat down next to her on the couch. She looked at my Wall of Books with a neutral expression, although by now my volumes stank mostly of Wild Flower Blast and not their natural printed essence. “I’m sorry you broke up with that guy in Italy,” I said. “You said on GlobalTeens he was really your type.”</p><p>“I don’t want to talk about him right now,” Eunice said.</p><p>Good, I didn’t, either. I just wanted to hold her. She was wearing an oatmeal sweatshirt, beneath which I could espy the twin straps of a bra she did not need. Her rough-hewn miniskirt made out of some kind of sandpaper fibre sat atop a pair of bright-violet panty hose, which also seemed unnecessary, given the warm June weather. Was she trying to protect herself from my roving hands? Or was she just very cold at her center? “You must be tired from the long flight,” I said, putting my hand on her violet knee.</p><p>“You’re sweating like crazy,” she said, laughing.</p><p>I wiped at my forehead, my hand coming away with the sheen of my age. “Sorry,” I said.</p><p>“Do I really excite you that much, nerd face?” she asked.</p><p>I didn’t say anything. I smiled.</p><p>“It’s nice of you to let me stay here.”</p><p>“Indefinitely!” I cried.</p><p>“We’ll see,” she said. As I squeezed her knee and made a slight movement upward, she caught my hairy wrist. “Let’s take it easy,” she said. “I just had my heart broken, remember?” She thought it over and added, “Ha-ha.”</p><p><em>June 17: Euni-Tard to Grillbitch.</em></p><p>Dear Precious Panda,</p><p>Sup, my little Busy Bee-iotch? I’m baaaaaaack. America the beautiful. Wow, I still can’t believe that everyone’s speaking English and not Italiano around me. Well, in Lenny’s ghetto neighborhood it’s mostly Spanish and Jewish, I guess. But whatever. I’m home. Things are quiet on the Fort Lee front, at least for the time being. I’m seeing my parents next week, but I think my dad just quiets down when he knows I’m across the river.</p><p>I miss Ben a lot. There was something so compatible about me and him. Like we didn’t have to say much to each other, we could just lie there in bed for hours, doing whatever on our äppäräti, with the lights turned off. It’s different with Lenny. I mean, cause there are so many things wrong with him, and I guess I just have to fix them all. The problem is he’s not young, so he thinks he doesn’t have to listen to me. His teeth are in so much better shape since I got him to brush correctly and his breath is fresh like a daisy. If only he would take care of his gross feet!<span data-page="page_10"></span> I’m going to make him set up an appointment with a podiatrist. Maybe my dad. JBF! My dad would freak if I told him I had a very old white, um, “friend.” Ha-ha. And then he dresses awful, in all these like old-school hipster outfits with the wide collars and these awful acrylic shirts from the seventies. I hope there’s a smoke detector in our apartment cause he just might set himself on fire one day. Anyway, I told him from the start: Look, you’re <em>thirty-nine</em> years old and I’m living with you, so now you’ve got to dress like a grownup. He feigned defiance, my little nerd, but next week we’re going shopping for stuff actually made out of <em>animal products</em> like cotton and wool and ca$hmere and all that good stuff.</p><p>You know what’s funny. Lenny keeps a journal of all the things he’s “celebrating.” It’s dorky, but I wonder about all the things I should be celebrating. So far my favorite thing is just walking down the street with him. He’ll tell me all these things I never even learned at Elderbird, like that New York used to be owned by the Dutch (what were they even doing in America?), and whenever we see something funny like a cute weenie dog we’ll both just totally break out laughing, and he’ll hold my hand and sweat and sweat and sweat.</p><p>We fight a lot. I guess it’s mostly my fault because I don’t appreciate his great personality and just keep focussing on how he looks. I told him I was leaving him and going back to Fort Lee and then my poor sweet nerd got down on his knees and started crying and saying how much I meant to him. He was so pathetic and so cute. I felt so sorry for him that I took off all my clothes, except for my TotalSurrenders, and just got in bed with him. He felt me up a little but we fell asleep pretty fast. Damn, Precious Panda. I’m just one chatty ass-hookah these days. I’m going to sign off, but here’s an Image of me and Lenny at the zoo in Central Park. He’s to the left of the bear. Don’t gag!!!!</p><p><em>June 25, New York.</em></p><p>When I walked into our synagogue’s main sanctuary one humid morning, Little Bobby Cohen, the youngest Post-Human staffer (I think he’s nineteen years old at the most), approached me wearing a kind of saffron monk getup. “Come with me, Leonard,” he said, his bar-mitzvah voice straining under the profundity of what he was about to do.</p><p>“Oh, what’s all this?” I asked, my heart pumping blood so hard my toes hurt.</p><p>As he led me to a tiny back office where, judging by the sweet-briny smell, the gefilte-fish supply used to be stored, Little Bobby sang, “May you live forever, may you never know death, may you float like Joshie, on a newborn’s breath.”</p><p>My God! The Desking Ceremony.</p><p>And there it was—my new desk! As Kelly fed me a ceremonial garlic bulb, followed by some sugar-free niacin mints, I surveyed all the pretty young people who had doubted me, all those Darryls and friends of Darryls, and I felt the queasy, mercurial justice of the world. I was back! My Roman failures were near-erased. I could begin again. I ran out into the synagogue’s sanctuary, where the Boards were noisily registering my existence, the letters “<em class="small">LENNY A.</em>” flipping into place at the very bottom of one of the Boards, along with my last blood work—not so hot—and the promising mood indicator “meek but coöperative.”</p><p>My desk. All three square feet of it, shiny and sleek, full of text and streams and Images rising up from the digital surface. I spent the bulk of my working week behind it. Opening up several data streams at once, and affecting a godlike air, I scanned the files of our prospective Life Lovers. Their white, beatific, mostly male faces (our research shows that women are more concerned with taking care of their progeny than with living forever) flashed before me, telling me about their charitable activities, their plans for humanity, their concern for our chronically ill planet, their dreams of eternal transcendence with like-minded yuan billionaires. I guessed that the last time they had been so painfully dishonest was when they penned their applications to Swarthmore, forty years earlier.</p><p>One of my Intakes, let’s call him Barry, ran a small Retail empire in the Southern states. When he came into the office he looked suitably anxious. We accept, on average, eighteen per cent of our High Net Worth applicants, our dreaded rejection letter still sent out by actual post. The Intake process lasted awhile. Barry, trying to subdue any remaining trace of his Alabama drawl, wanted to sound knowledgeable about our work. He asked about cellular inspection, repair, and reconstruction. I painted him a three-dimensional picture of millions of autonomous nanobots inside his well-preserved squash-toned body, extracting nutrients, supplementing, delivering, playing with the building blocks, copying, manipulating, reprogramming, replacing blood, destroying harmful bacteria and viruses, reversing soft-tissue destruction, preventing bacterial infection, repairing DNA.</p><p>I gave Barry the Willingness to Live Test. The H-Scan Test to measure the subject’s biological age. The Willingness to Persevere in Difficult Conditions Test. The Infinite Sadness Endurance Test. The Response to Loss of Child Test.<span data-page="page_11"></span> He must have sensed how much was at stake, his sharp Waspy beak aquiver as the images were projected against his pupils, the results streaming on my äppärät. He would do anything to persevere. He had three children and would cling to them forever, even if his present-day bank account would not be able to preserve more than two for eternity. I entered “Sophie’s Choice” on my Intake äppärät, a major problem as far as Joshie was concerned.</p><p>“How soon?” Barry asked. “When will all this be possible?”</p><p>“We’re almost there,” I said, despairing. Signing up a new client would trigger an automatic bonus deposit into my <em class="small">BRIC-A-BRAC</em> account; that, in turn, would help fund the first of my beta-dechronification treatments. But Barry was a dead end. Forget my name on the Boards. The train was pulling out of the station, and I was running behind it, my suitcase half open, white underwear spilling comically along the platform.</p><p>Barry was exhausted. The Patterson-Clay-Schwartz Language Cognition Test, the final barometer for selection, could wait for another session. I knew already that this perfectly reasonable, preternaturally kind fifty-two-year-old would not make the cut. He was doomed like me. And so I smiled at him, congratulated him on his candor and patience, his intellect and maturity, and, with a tap of my finger against my digital desk, threw him onto the blazing funeral pyre of history.</p><p><em>June 25: Euni-Tard to Grillbitch.</em></p><p>Hi, Precious Panda,</p><p>Sup, meathole? Oh, man. Or, “Oy, man,” as my Jewish boyfriend would say.</p><p>Oh, Panda of mine. What am I doing with Lenny? What kind of freaked me out was that I saw Len read a book. (No, it didn’t <em>smell</em>. He uses Pine-Sol on them.) He came home from work looking really down, and I guess he didn’t even notice that I caught him reading. And I don’t mean scanning a text like we did in EuroTrash Classics with that “Chatterhouse of Parma,” I mean seriously <em>reading</em>. He had this ruler out and he was moving it down the page very slowly and just like whispering little things to himself, like trying to understand every little part of it. I was going to teen my sister but I was so embarrassed I just stood there and watched him read, which lasted for like <em>half an hour</em> and finally he put the book down and I pretended like nothing happened. And then I sneaked a peek and it was that Russian guy Tolesoy he was reading (I guess it figures, cause Lenny’s parents are from Russia). I thought Ben was really brain-smart because I saw him streaming “Chronicles of Narnia” in that café in Rome, but this Tolesoy was a thousand-page-long <em>book</em>, not a stream, and Lenny was on page 930, almost finished. I was intimidated by Ben in Rome because of his looks and I never felt super-secure in bed because of that. With Lenny, I’m intimidated by his brain-smarts, but it’s easier. I can be myself, because everything he does is so sweet and honest. I gave him a half-gag CIM blow job and he was so grateful he actually started to cry. Who does that? I guess sometimes I just want to want him as much as he wants me. And I want him to relax and maybe not always be so cute and caring and trying to please me, so that maybe I can pursue him a little myself.</p><p><em>June 28, New York.</em></p><p>I learned how to say “elephant” in Korean this week.</p><p>We went to the Bronx Zoo because my Media friend Noah Weinberg said on his stream that the American Restoration Authority was going to close the place down and ship all the animals to Saudi Arabia “to die of heatstroke.” I never know which part of Noah’s streams to believe; the way we live now you can’t be too sure. We had fun with the monkeys and José the Beaver and all the smaller animals, but the highlight was this beautiful savanna elephant named Sammy. When we ambled up to his humble enclosure, Eunice grabbed my nose and said, “<em>Kokiri</em>.”</p><p>“<em>Ko</em>,” she explained, “means ‘nose.’ So <em>kokiri</em>. Long nose. ‘Elephant’ in Korean.”</p><p>“I hab a long dose because I’m Jewish,” I said, trying to pull her hand off my face. “Dere’s duthing I can do aboud it.”</p><p>“You’re so sensitive, Lenny,” she said, laughing. “I heart your nose so much. I wish I <em>had</em> a nose.” And she started kissing my comma of a snout in full view of the pachyderm, going gently up and down the endless thing with her tough little lips. As she did so, I locked eyes with the elephant, and I watched myself being kissed in the prism of the elephant’s eye, the giant hazel apparatus surrounded by flecks of coarse gray eyebrow. He was twenty-five, Sammy, at the middle of his life span, much like me. A lonely elephant, the only one the zoo had at the moment, removed from his compatriots and from the possibility of love. He slowly flicked back one huge ear, like a Galician shopkeeper of a century ago spreading his arms as if to say, “Yes, this is all there is.” And then it occurred to me, lucky me mirrored in the beast’s eye, lucky Lenny having his trunk kissed by Eunice Park: <em>The elephant knows</em>. The elephant<span data-page="page_final"></span> knows there is nothing after this life and very little in it. The elephant is aware of his looming extinction, and he is hurt by it, reduced by it, made to feel his solitary nature, he who will eventually trample his way through bush and scrub to lie down and die where his mother once trembled her haunches to give him life. Mother, aloneness, entrapment, extinction. The elephant is essentially an Ashkenazi animal, but a wholly rational one—it, too, wants to live forever.</p><p>And here’s another thing the elephant knew. He knew that I would never make it as a past-tense man in a world set to the future. He knew that I would never make it as a Life Lovers Outreach Coördinator (Grade G). He knew that my name would fall off the Boards soon enough and that Joshie would find a way to fire me. He knew that all the green tea in Japan would not regenerate my liver, that SmartBlood would never run through my veins.</p><p>Then I thought of what I knew. I thought of Eunice Park and her pH-balanced body, healthy and strong. I thought of the warm early-summer day gathering in force, the New York of early summers past, the city that used to hold so many promises, the city of a million I.O.U.s. I thought of Eunice’s lips on my nose, the love mixed in with the pain, the foretaste of almonds and salt. I thought of how it was all just too beautiful to ever let go.</p><p>“Let’s go home,” I said to Eunice. “I don’t want <em>kokiri</em> to see you kissing my nose like that. It’ll only make him sadder.” ♦</p>	Gary Shteyngart	June 14 & 21, 2010 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/06/14/lenny-hearts-eunice	Aging	Airports	Books	Corporations	Credit	E-Mail	Lenny Abramov	First	Immigrants
Literally	<p>“She’s <span data-page="page_1"></span>always late!” the sixteen-year-old sobbed. She’d set up the ironing board and its accessories like a shrine to housewifery. Heat shimmered in the air, had already slightly compromised the plastic of the spray bottle. Only Bonita could master the pleats of Suzanne’s ghastly uniform skirt. Other girls did not care. Still others had punctual housekeepers. Or parents who ironed.</p><p>“Suse is so anal,” her brother, Danny, noted from the table, where he and his father were studying their computer screens over breakfast, sharing news items and a bowl of pineapple. “She takes three showers a day, which is more than some people take in a year. In the future, that will be illegal. Seriously, I skip showers so that our carbon footprint won’t be so terrible.”</p><p>“Do you know there’s a second part to that expression? The ‘retentive’ part?” his father asked. “It’s amazing how comfortable people are tossing that around—‘anal retentive.’ People are very casual with the psychology. So blasé about the butt.”</p><p>“God <em>damn</em> it!” the girl cried. “Please please please!”</p><p>“Also,” Danny said, “she exaggerates. Constantly.”</p><p>“Literally,” his father said. Richard liked to make his son smile by using his favorite word incorrectly.</p><p>Suzanne had done everything she could: curled her hair, made up her face, donned her shirt and shorts and shoes and socks, packed her backpack, checked her assignments, opened the back door, cleared a path to the ironing board. She had spread the khaki skirt on the narrow end, where it sagged practically to the floor. Others at her school—the school she’d begged to attend, and which she worked at Dairy Queen to help pay for, a private élite place run by nuns, where boys were not allowed—had altered their uniforms, raising the skirt’s hemline far above the knee. Still others arrived at the gate wearing sweatpants or jeans, and then pulled on the required garment like a burlap bag, something they’d kick to the floorboards of their cars minutes after the last bell rang.</p><p>“<em>Lo siento!</em>” Richard heard, along with the clatter of Bonita’s heels. “<em>Lo siento, Susana, mija!</em>” And the hiss of steam as the iron met the cloth, and further Spanish as Bonita apologized and soothed, his daughter’s name a shushing on her lips, <em>Soos</em>, <em>Soos</em>, <em>Soos</em>. He finally let out his breath. “Thank God,” he murmured.</p><p>“Amen,” Danny said.</p><p>“I have choir and then work,” Suzanne called to her father as she rushed out the back door. These days, she spent more time apart from her family than with them. That would be the story from now on, Richard thought, the incremental move away.</p><p>Bonita had brought her son, Isaac, with her, as she always did, but she let Richard know that the boy wouldn’t be going to school today, because he was suffering a bout of what she had only ever been able to describe as “<em>nervioso</em>,” rubbing her stomach to illustrate her son’s mysterious and chronic affliction. His mother pronounced his name “Ee-sock,” although the boy preferred “I-zack.” Unlike his mother, he spoke fluent English. He and Danny were the same age—eleven. Bonita used the family’s street address as her own so that Isaac could attend the nearby public school. Most days, the boys would walk the three blocks together, the very fair Danny alongside the fairly dark Isaac. When they were younger, they’d held hands. For the past three years, since Richard’s wife had died, the boys had been permitted to be in the same class, even though they distracted each other, communicating almost telepathically. No one challenged them when they requested a joint trip to the nurse’s office; no one admonished them when they were absent on the same day. There seemed to be an endless bounty of understanding at that modest brick school, situated at the heart of a neighborhood populated by university professors and medical personnel, with equitable two-income, two-car, two-children homes, staffed by nannies and gardeners and housekeepers, an insulated hub of bleeding-heart liberalism.</p><p>Still, no matter how well-meaning a school it was, no matter how conscientious about maintaining Spanish signage and notifications, Bonita was intimidated by its administration. Before, it had been Richard’s wife who played intermediary; now it was Richard who phoned in the excuses for the boys; Richard who attended the parent-teacher conferences, too, Bonita sitting beside him nodding, listening but only half-understanding what was being carefully noted about her son. She had five other children, older than Isaac, a few on their own already, all of them independent enough. Where Isaac’s siblings had gone to school, in Gulfton, there had been no counselling services or narrative reports. There had been grades and failures, expulsions and swats. Isaac’s brothers and sisters had put Bonita through many trials—arrests, pregnancies, car accidents—but Isaac’s trouble, its invisibility, was new to her.</p><p>He was tentative, alert to any little sound or look of disapproval; if you moved too quickly, he flinched, as delicate and lithe as a water bug. He often cried; his stomach seized whenever he was confronted with something he was afraid of, and he was afraid of many things—loud noises and crowds and dogs and busy streets and elevators and balconies and the dark and his nightmares and chaos in general and change of even the smallest sort and, most of all, his father, who, during his rare appearances at home, was a drunken and brutal man. Bonita’s other<span data-page="page_2"></span> children had been toughened by their bad dad and their rough neighborhood and their over-all hard luck, rendered sturdy by duress, but Isaac had been made too tender.</p><p>“You want to play hooky with Isaac?” Richard asked Danny. Isaac smiled shyly from the doorway, his silver front tooth catching the light. Whenever Richard spotted that tooth, he had the same thought: if his wife had still been alive when the tooth was knocked out, she’d have seen to an ivory replacement.</p><p>“This morning, but not this afternoon,” Danny said. “Can you go this afternoon?” he asked Isaac. “It’s pizza-party day, remember?”</p><p>Isaac’s panic often eased after a few hours of an ongoing game the boys called “town,” on the living-room rug. Isaac loved Danny. Next year would be the heartbreaking, stomach-aching change from the sanctuary of elementary school to the hormone hell that was middle school; Richard hated to think of it. He suspected that Isaac would eventually recognize himself as homosexual, that others might know it sooner than he, that Bonita’s challenges as mother to this boy would become only more overwhelming.</p><p>Richard had an urge to play hooky himself—to seize Suzanne away from the nuns, then bar the doors and hunker down. “Be good, boys,” he said to them as he reluctantly put together his backpack and travel mug. Only now did he notice that Bonita was wearing a pair of jeans that his wife had given her long ago, hand-me-downs. Every year, a plastic bag of last year’s clothing had made its way to Bonita; when his wife died, Bonita had shaken her head at the offer of the entire closetful, turned her face as if to keep from witnessing further shameful behavior from her employer. “No,” Richard had agreed, swiftly closing the door on the dresses and shoes. Also: his children sometimes visited those dresses, which still smelled, they said, like their mother.</p><p>The trio before Richard made a pretty picture, the two smiling boys and the kind, hardworking woman. “<em>Adios</em>,” he told her. “<em>Hasta luego</em>.”</p><p>“Bomb threat?” Richard joked when he arrived at the <em>Chronicle</em> to find a group of co-workers milling and muttering outside. But, in fact, that <em>was</em> why everyone had been evacuated.</p><p>“Credible,” they kept repeating. An official bomb squad was rumored to be on the way. When rain began falling, Richard and his advertising staff headed across the street to the breakfast place they liked. There had been layoffs in editorial the previous Friday; it was logical, wasn’t it, that this would follow? A betting pool was started, various malcontents cited. Richard put three bucks on Lawrence Lattimer.</p><p>“Lawrence?” his co-workers cried.</p><p>“It’s always the mild-mannered ones,” Richard said. “Always the last guy you’d ever guess.” By noon, the building had been declared safe, the threat empty. Then it wasn’t Lawrence Lattimer, Richard decided, trudging up the stairs to his department. Lawrence would have followed through, blown an emphatic hole in the place that had betrayed him. No, an empty threat would come from someone like Jill King, the flighty intern who had flirted outrageously and then claimed sexual harassment. Her gestures were inflammatory yet random. She’d probably phoned in the threat and then gone online to stalk a former boyfriend. Later, she’d hit the mall and successfully shoplift a complete outfit, feeling it was owed to her. Or something like that. She wasn’t serious enough to stick to her word.</p><p>He was on his office line explaining Isaac and Danny’s absence from morning classes when his cell went off, the special home ringtone that he never ignored. “Hang on a sec,” he said to the school secretary.</p><p>“They go out!” Bonita said without preamble. “No here!”</p><p>“Are the boys at school?” he asked the secretary.</p><p>“No, sir.”</p><p>An hour, Bonita guessed, when he asked how long they’d been gone. As was always the case when he and Bonita spoke to each other—neither remotely fluent in the other’s language—the information exchange was crude yet functional. It was she who’d phoned him to report his wife’s car crash, she who’d fielded the notification from the highway patrol. She who’d had only to say “<em>La señora</em>” and then wail to let him know. What Richard understood today was that the boys were on a collecting mission, in search of some necessary prop for the narrative developing on the living-room rug. There were cars, stores, blocks; they made a town and filled it with houses and businesses, tracks and roads and paths. On occasion, they left their indoor game to fetch a pile of twigs or sand or stones. Once, they found a turtle and built an elaborate habitat for it in their little city. Somewhere beyond the back door there must have been a critical piece, a shared imperative driving the boys out together.</p><p>He wasn’t going to get any work done today, after all, Richard thought, clattering down the stairs.</p><p>He and Bonita divided the neighborhood in half and began walking. It reminded him of searching for the family dog, an irritating terrier that would never stay penned. Except that he wasn’t calling or whistling, just speed-walking with the familiar hopelessness of dread, the urge and need to <em>do</em> something. He was trying to think like Danny and Isaac. Would they have walked to the comic shop? It was a couple of miles away, but it was the only place that<span data-page="page_3"></span> Richard could imagine them going on foot—and their bikes were still in the garage. Same with their skateboards and scooters and trikes, two of each of the wheeled toys they’d mastered together. Richard had already envisioned teaching them to drive, taking them to the parking lots and cemeteries where he’d taken Suzanne when she was learning, last year. Bonita did not drive; she was, after nearly three decades in Houston, still afraid to navigate its streets and highways. She and Isaac rode the bus; it took them an hour each way to Richard’s home.</p><p>“His place,” Richard said aloud and abruptly turned around, convinced suddenly that the boys had gone to Isaac’s. Just the week before, Danny had said, out of the blue, “It’s weird I’ve never seen inside their apartment.” Plenty of times he’d come along when Richard dropped off or picked up Bonita and Isaac. But the pair were always waiting in the murky ground-floor vestibule or rushing through it, on their way to their two-bedroom unit on the third floor, which was far too small for their large family. One of Isaac’s chief complaints was that he never knew who would be asleep beside him when he woke up in the morning: brother, sister, nephew, niece.</p><p>“Jessss,” Bonita agreed, nodding thoughtfully, drawing out the word, when Richard found her and asked if it was possible that the boys had wanted something of Isaac’s to complete their game. As usual, Bonita failed to buckle her seat belt when they got in the car, and Richard didn’t correct her. The pinging alarm would soon silence itself. This vehicle was a replacement for the one that had been totalled three years earlier; his wife had not been buckled in, either. “<em>Lo siento</em>,” Bonita said for the hundredth time, shaking her head in self-chastisement.</p><p>“It’s not your fault,” Richard assured her. “They know better. <em>Está bien</em>.” Sitting beside each other in the car made them both nervous, Richard supposed; they hadn’t ridden together minus the children before. Her distinct smell, the fact of her vanities—the orange-tinted streaks in her hair, the powdery makeup, the bra strap cutting into her shoulder, her impractical high-heeled shoes—strikingly present. Female and male, close to the same age, arranged together in their traditional spots. Other drivers on the freeway could have plausibly assumed that Richard and his passenger were a couple. When Richard exited toward Bonita’s neighborhood, the observations of others became less benign. These were people on foot, lounging on porches, leaning against poles, gathering at curbs, and then sauntering slowly into the street, forcing cars to give way, throwing Richard direct and challenging glares. It felt a bit like crossing the border, the convenience stores and groceries and taco trucks all offering their wares in Spanish, the smell in the air of Mexican food, a wariness in both the visitor and the visited. Bonita had come to Texas long ago; Richard had no idea whether her status was legal, knew only that her children had all been born here.</p><p>At her building, she was out of the car before he’d turned off the engine, running awkwardly, her purse forgotten on the seat. Anyone watching might reasonably have guessed that Richard had done something terrible to her, that she was fleeing. His habit in the past had been to wait until the light came on in her apartment upstairs, until Bonita showed herself on the balcony and waved to him. How foolish he felt now, following her, carrying her large pink leopard-spotted bag. On the walkway was a trail of trash—a diaper, a Frenchy’s bag, a smear of food that someone had walked through. The pack of dogs that usually lay panting in the vacant lot next door were howling in the distance.  [cartoon id="a16982"]</p><p>The building’s door was open, for which Richard was grateful—the men and the dogs outside made him uneasy. Up the stained stairs he climbed to the third floor. Like much of Houston, this habitat had had its brief heyday, maybe fifty years before; it had been a fashionable singles complex, built well enough to survive only its first set of tenants intact. Now it was a shoddy ruin, a place with broken balcony railings and pocked with a hundred ugly satellite dishes, a dry swimming pool filled with forsaken furniture and fenced off with concertina wire. Bonita’s apartment was both too high for the rickety balcony to seem safe and too low to keep out a persistent climber. A breeding ground of anxiety and temptation.</p><p>A silver-haired man in coveralls stood on a step stool in the hall, repairing or disabling the sprinkler head on the ceiling.</p><p>“Excuse me,” Richard said to him, “do you know which is Gutierrez?”</p><p>“<em>Como</em>?” the man asked, stepping down with difficulty, in his hand a tool that Richard thought belonged in the garden or perhaps the kitchen, a small rakelike thing. Eye to eye, he realized that the guy was close to his own age, that his white hair was premature, and that the man was as confused by what Richard held as Richard was by the little rake.</p><p>“Bonita,” Richard explained, gesturing at the purse. “Isaac and Bonita <em>y mi hermano</em>—no, <em>mi hijo</em>—<em>aquí</em>?” He indicated a door that might match the balcony he knew was hers. The man was frowning at Bonita’s belongings. “<em>Soy</em> Richard,” Richard added lamely. “<em>Trabajo</em>?” he said, hoping the<span data-page="page_4"></span> word would inspire some kind of sensible cognition. Richard’s wife had spoken Spanish, so she had done all the talking. She and Bonita had often had lengthy conversations that left Richard with only the scantest broad understanding, through the few words he recognized, all subtleties lost. Had he pointed this out, his wife would have told him that it was a fair representation of men’s general understanding of the world: they grasped its fundamentals but not its minutiae. “Gross motor skills,” she would have said. “As opposed to fine.”</p><p>The man in the coveralls put himself between Richard and the door to Apartment 3-C, rapping briskly on it, the clawed tool in his other hand. Richard was glad that the building had a handyman who wished to protect its tenants; Bonita and Isaac occasionally spent nights alone here, when the older brothers weren’t around. From Richard’s wife, Bonita had learned how to have the locks changed so that her husband could not legally reënter the place. Richard’s wife had also helped Bonita get divorced, and then had insisted on restraining orders when neither a locked door nor a legal document convinced the ex-husband that he wasn’t wanted.</p><p>“And sometimes,” Richard’s wife had been forced to concede, “Bonita actually <em>does</em> want him.” That was the tricky part the law couldn’t touch.</p><p>“<em>Gracias</em>,” Richard said to the man in coveralls, who nodded, still skeptical of the hapless Anglo with the woman’s handbag. “Isaac?” Richard called out. “Bonita? Danny? Open up, guys.”</p><p>When Isaac finally cracked the door, the handyman stepped inside. Just before the door closed in Richard’s face, he saw the raw panic in Isaac’s eyes and understood that this character in the hall was Bonita’s ex-husband.</p><p>“Fuck!” Richard banged on the door now himself. “I’m calling the police,” he threatened. A door down the hall opened and a head leaned out, then popped back in like a turtle’s. “I’m calling right now unless you open this fucking door! Danny!” he yelled. “Danny! Bonita! Open the door!” He was ransacking Bonita’s purse in search of her phone, tissues and candy and a tiny Bible spilling onto the floor. Just as he found it, the door flew open.</p><p>“Dad,” Danny said, pressing into his father’s ribcage. “I’m sorry.”</p><p>“It’s O.K. Where’s Isaac?”</p><p>“He locked himself in his room.”</p><p>“You go get in there with him, O.K.?”</p><p>From the kitchen came an animated exchange of Spanish. Not angry, Richard thought, but opinionated, people in passionate relation to each other, Bonita’s voice the more strident, the ex-husband’s explanatory, if not apologetic, pleading. Richard listened for some sign that he should intervene, follow through on the threat of phoning the authorities. He stepped around a plastic-covered dining table to wait outside the kitchen doorway. The buffet against the wall was stacked with canned goods, which reminded him of Bonita’s first day working for his family, a decade or so ago. She had retrieved from their trash the unopened but expired boxes and cans of food that his wife had thrown away in preparation for a housekeeper. An embarrassing moment, not unlike this one, in which Richard had not known how to properly explain why Bonita shouldn’t consume the outdated food, or shouldn’t accede to her criminal ex-husband’s wishes. Above the buffet hung pictures of Isaac’s siblings and nieces and nephews and sisters- and brothers-in-law, each and every one a school or studio portrait, groups in matched attire grinning at the photographer. A few included the father, who, on occasion, had made his way into the annual photo, as he had made his way into his ex-wife’s home and maybe sometimes into her bed. Perhaps that would be today’s story, Bonita being a naturally forgiving woman, weak in the face of some lingering, nostalgic habit of love. Love for the man in coveralls, that figure who came to Isaac in nightmares and made him scream, who might or might not have been responsible for knocking out Isaac’s front tooth—a story that Richard’s wife would have got to the bottom of.</p><p>Richard left his listening post and joined the boys in Isaac’s room. It was protected by a deadbolt. This despite the fact that the door itself would have easily shattered or splintered at the mildest use of force. The room, like the rest of the apartment, was very tidy and held a few familiar touches: a castoff desk and chair from Richard’s home, gifts the two boys had got in common: a lighted globe, a poster of SpongeBob. “We just needed this guy,” Danny was explaining, in his palm a drunk-looking Duplo clown, while Isaac sat trembling on the bed with his hands over his ears. “We were making an amusement park in the town, and this is literally the only guy who fits in the cannon. Nobody else has the right feet.” Richard sat beside Isaac and gently took the boy’s hands into his own, explaining the problem with what the boys had done, the worry they’d caused, riding the buses alone, the risk of accident and mishap, the menace of malign strangers, adding that he and Bonita weren’t angry so much as scared. Isaac burst into tears, and Danny just looked perplexed.</p><p>“If it’s so dangerous, how come we let Bonita and Isaac do it?” he asked. “They do it every day, twice. And also, I think, statistically, buses crash a lot less often<span data-page="page_5"></span> than cars.” Danny would be a lawyer, Richard thought, not for the first time. He was logical, and passionate about fairness, fearless in an interesting way. Right after Danny had spoken, however, he seemed to realize precisely what he’d said, and then he, too, was sniffling, burrowing into Richard from the other side. A time would come, Richard thought, when he and his children wouldn’t think of that terrible car crash and death every day, when they would no longer be ambushed by missing her.</p><p>Through the thin walls, they could hear the voices carrying on in the kitchen, his and hers, cajoling, laughing, then the embarrassing noise of nothing. Intimacy. And then the sound of his being sent away, a quiet, reluctant goodbye.</p><p>“Is O.K.,” Bonita eventually called at the locked door. “Is O.K., <em>se fue</em>. Isaac?” Simultaneously, the boys pulled away from Richard, wiped their eyes, put on their game faces. Richard unlocked the door. “Is O.K. now,” Bonita told him, her eyes also tearful. “He go.” It was hard to say who initiated their embrace, only the second in their long association. It seemed a mutual impulse, sadness, need—the same feelings they’d shared at the funeral, three years ago. Bonita’s shoulders heaved. Tears: they did not require translation. How convenient it would be, Richard thought, Bonita’s wiry hair against his neck, her face on his shoulder, how terribly <em>useful</em> if they could simply wed, he minus a wife, she with her problematic ex-husband, and regroup together like a sitcom family in the fortified comfort of Richard’s house across town, an arrangement that would be possible if they could just ignore that troubling enigma of love.</p><p>“Oh, no,” she cried, smiling when they separated, wiping at the mascara on his shirt. “How you say?” she said to the boys, wiggling her fingers.</p><p>“Spiders,” they replied together.</p><p>“Dad?” Danny said from the back seat. Richard checked the rearview; his son’s tone was hesitant. “Dad, inside your head, do you hear conversations?”</p><p>“Like memories? Like of disagreements?”</p><p>“No, like . . .” He tipped his chin to look upward. “Like instructions,” he finally settled on.</p><p>Richard considered this. “Not exactly,” he said. “I mean, I think in words, and the words are about making decisions, sometimes, although also sometimes I just—”</p><p>“No, not like that,” his son interrupted. “Like some other voice, not your own.”</p><p>“Sure. I hear people I know, or knew, when they said impor—”</p><p>“No, no, no. Nobody you know, not you or a friend or a relative.”</p><p>“What are you talking about?”</p><p>“Isaac said not to tell anyone this.”</p><p>“But you’re worried.”</p><p>“Don’t tell Bonita.”</p><p>Richard checked his blind spot and merged onto the 59. Rush hour was just about to kick in; the exchange from downtown was already filling, an army of headlights in the oncoming dusk. “Whatever you tell me, son, nobody will ever know I got it from you. O.K.?”</p><p>“O.K. So Isaac says that inside his head people are talking.”</p><p>“He hears voices?”</p><p>“I guess so.”</p><p>“And what do they say?”</p><p>“How would I know?”</p><p>Fair enough, Richard thought. Was eleven the right age for schizophrenia to set in? His wife, master of all matters psychological, could have confirmed this. And more immediately relevant: was eleven the right age to scare his son with the idea of his best friend being schizophrenic? The problem with telling somebody something was that he wouldn’t later be able to unhear it.</p><p>“Bonita and I will take Isaac to the doctor,” Richard promised. His wife had done this in the past. When the mysterious nervous stomach had first flared up, she had insisted to Bonita that the condition was serious. In Isaac, she had, perhaps, seen some of her own anxiousness, an insidious presence that Bonita did not recognize.</p><p>“We should have never left the house,” Danny said, shaking his head.</p><p>“If I had a nickel for every day I thought that,” Richard agreed.</p><p>Suzanne was home when they arrived, filling the house with the sweet chemical smell of soft-serve. She often brought home “mistakes,” confections lacking the trademark swirl, or misunderstood orders, edible but wrong. Danny especially appreciated the Peanut Buster Parfait mistakes, his favorite. But Suzanne wasn’t due back until midnight tonight; Richard sighed, assuming she’d been fired. This day—would it never stop sending up trouble? But, no, she hadn’t been fired. She was tearing up the house in search of her cell phone.</p><p>“The last time I know I saw it was like two in the morning last night!” she shrieked from her bedroom. She’d thought it was in her backpack, she reported. Then she’d figured it had fallen out in the car. After an anxious hour at the Dairy Queen counter, she hadn’t been able to stand it any longer.</p><p>“And it’s <em>nowhere!</em>” she wailed. Like Isaac, Suzanne panicked at problems that others might approach more casually. She had always been high-strung, particular about details, a self-critical perfectionist like her mother, unconvinced of her beauty, easily flustered. On her forehead a crease from premature concern, a skeptical tuck of her lip when she deflected a compliment.</p><p>“She ruined our town,” Danny complained. “She kicked everything over.”</p><p>“Have you called it?” Richard asked Suzanne, and received only a withering glance. The three of them spent the next half hour ransacking the place, reminding one another to try to think like Bonita,<span data-page="page_final"></span> who might have found the phone earlier in the day and put it somewhere she thought logical. Long ago, Richard’s wife’s missing diaphragm had finally been located in a basket of bath toys; the parts of the food processor tucked away in the tools drawer. She was sometimes too thorough, Bonita; once, she had rearranged all the books in the house, after dusting the shelves, restoring them not in alphabetical order but by color and size: short red books together, tall yellow ones side by side. Richard’s wife had pulled him into the study just to marvel—at the sight, and at the labor it would take to undo.</p><p>So Danny checked the bowl of remote controls on the coffee table and Richard crawled around the kitchen floor reaching under the counters and between the appliances. Suzanne kept up a continuous chant of “God damn it”s.</p><p>“We’ll get you another,” Richard called out to her. “Really, sweetheart, it’s probably time for an upgrade, anyway.”</p><p>“Mom’s messages are on it,” Danny said quietly, when they met up outside Suzanne’s bedroom door to watch her heave her mattress and its bedding to the floor.</p><p>“Oh, shit,” Richard said. Just the week before, he’d opened a cookbook and found not only his wife’s handwritten notes in the recipe but a few of her fingernails between the pages. She had been a lifelong biter. In a flash, he’d seen her leaning over the book, chin in palm, pinkie between her teeth, humming while waiting for something to boil or reduce on the stovetop.</p><p>“We can get them back,” Richard said, of the messages. “Probably,” he added, because he wasn’t positive.</p><p>“This has been a terrible day,” Danny said. “Even though nothing exactly bad happened.”</p><p>“Agreed,” Richard said. Naturally, they were now both thinking about the worst day, the one on which Danny and Suzanne’s mother had been killed after driving into the path of an eighteen-wheeler. For an instant, a wave of rage filled Richard, a plosive pure fury at his wife for not being here where she was needed.</p><p>On days like these, terrible but not exactly bad, he could entertain the dismal possibility that her accident hadn’t been an accident. “Before you ask me,” Eve had said when Richard began to propose marriage, twenty-five years ago, “I have to tell you a secret.”</p><p>“I’m listening.” He’d smiled indulgently.</p><p>“No, seriously. It’s bad. As a teen-ager, I used to play this dangerous game when I was driving. Closing my eyes. Turning off the lights. Speeding. It was pretty out of control. I was that unhappy. I really didn’t care if I lived or died.” She’d closed her eyes to recall it there at the restaurant, their table abruptly an island in a sea of meaningless chatter. Red splotches appeared on her cheeks, beads of sweat on her upper lip. That worried crease on her brow, which she would share with her future daughter, and her young voice, forever thereafter in Richard’s head. “Just so you know,” she’d told him. “You can change your mind about me. Just forget marrying me and move on.”</p><p>But that had turned out not to be true. He couldn’t. ♦</p>	Antonya Nelson	December 3, 2012 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/12/03/literally	Boys	Car Crashes	Cellular telephones	Children	Daughters	Disappearances	Richard	Third	Immigrants
No More Maybe	<p>Since my mother-in-law came to visit America she is quite busy. First, she has to eat many blueberries. Because in China they are expensive! While here they are comparatively cheap. Then she has to breathe the clean air. My husband, Wuji, and I have lived here for five years, so we are used to the air. But my mother-in-law has to take many fast walks. Breathing, breathing. Trying to clean out her lungs, she says, trying to get all the healthy oxygen inside her. She also has to look at the sky.</p><p>“So blue!” she says during the daytime. “I have not seen such a blue since I was a child.”</p><p>At nighttime, she says, “Look at the stars. Look! Look!”</p><p>She has to post pictures of the stars on WeChat for her friends. And she has to take some English-language classes. Because these classes are expensive in China! she says. Here they are free.</p><p>She thinks this is very strange.</p><p>“Why are they free?” she asks. She says, “America is a capitalist country. What about so-called ‘market force’?” “Market force” sticks out of her Chinese like a rock in a path. “And what about so-called ‘invisible hands’?” she goes on, and there it is—another rock.</p><p>“ ‘Invisible hand,’ ” my father-in-law says. Because he is the professor in the family, and the one who knows everything.</p><p>And, in fact, my mother-in-law only just learned about the invisible hand two days ago. Even yesterday she called Adam Smith “Alan Smith.” But, in China, she was a volleyball coach. She has a lot of self-confidence. She talks with her chin in the air. Even though she is retired, she uses only the top half of her bifocals. It is as if she is still watching some game, looking for weakness on the other side of the net. And, sure enough, look: already she has found something fake about America. America calls itself capitalist, but no one should be fooled. It is China that is capitalist.</p><p>“You know what free classes are?” she says. “Free classes are socialism!”</p><p>If my father-in-law likes to make points, my mother-in-law likes to score points.</p><p>Now my father-in-law hides his face in his rice bowl. Only his chopsticks move. It is as if he is trying to scratch a small, small message inside the bowl. One line. Two lines. Still scratching. We think maybe he cannot explain the free English lessons, either. Or maybe he just needs time to prepare his explanation. He was an outstanding thinker when he was young. But since he retired he has crazy, wild hair, like that conductor Seiji Ozawa, and his thinking is crazy wild, too.</p><p>We talk to help him. Try to make him comfortable, try to smooth things over.</p><p>“America is very strange,” I say.</p><p>“It is not socialism,” Wuji says. “It is capitalism with American characteristics.”</p><p>“It is politically correct capitalism,” I say.</p><p>Because this is what we know how to do. We know how to say something true enough to hide a bigger truth. We know how to hide people’s weakness. How to protect them.</p><p>Of course, when he was young my father-in-law also protected people. Every day there was a new kind of craziness. Every day a new kind of corruption. He had a lot to manage. Still, no matter how bad the situation got he protected us and a lot of other people besides. It was a big talent he had, a real strength. We all remember it and appreciate what he did. But now that he is older he sometimes scatters seed for the chickens, as they say. He stirs things up instead of calming things down. Maybe this is what couples do when they do not have sex. That is what Wuji says.</p><p>I think Wuji is full of such theories because I am too pregnant for sex.</p><p>Now my father-in-law’s chopsticks stop scratching. He lowers his bowl.</p><p>“Maybe the government watches to see who comes to the English lessons,” he says. “Maybe that is why they are free.”</p><p>“That is crazy!” my mother-in-law says. “Watching everyone is a lot of work. Do you think Americans will do that kind of work? Only Chinese will do it. Americans are too lazy.”</p><p>“Maybe it is a trap,” my father-in-law says.</p><p>“What is there to trap?” my mother-in-law says. “Who wants to know that I’m taking English lessons? No one. I am nobody. No one is interested.”</p><p>“Everyone knows the government here spies on people, just like in China,” my father-in-law says. “Look at that movie ‘Snowden.’ They spy here, too. They do.”</p><p>He reaches slowly for some steamed fish from the dish in the middle of the table. My mother-in-law takes her glasses off, as if the score is tied and she is ready to fight the other coach. So now poor Wuji has to say something. He is kind of like the ump.</p><p>“Yes, they spy in the U.S.,” he says. “But it is not just like China. Here there are many more laws to protect the common citizen.”</p><p>Wuji is careful because even an ump must know how to handle my father-in-law. He must first agree with his father, and only afterward disagree.</p><p>Still, my father-in-law argues. “Every government is the same,” he says. “What if that person is so-called ‘illegal immigrant,’ right?<span data-page="page_2"></span> You go to the free English classes. Then what? Then they catch you.”</p><p>And suddenly we think, even if the classes were not originally a trap, maybe they are a trap now. We think maybe my father-in-law is still smart. We think maybe we should listen to him.</p><p>After all, even though we are here legally, we see all the stories on the Internet. People are being stopped! People on buses. People even in hospitals. We carry our visas everywhere, and keep a list of places we should not go. Texas. New Hampshire. Alabama. Also, we do not talk too much to outside people. Of course, we do not talk too much to them anyway, because this is a city. People do not talk here; they honk. <em>Honk</em>, <em>honk</em>, <em>honk!</em> <em>You are in my way!</em> If they talk, they are yelling. <em>What the fuck are you doing</em>? <em>Don’t you speak English</em>? But these days we talk even less. In fact, we are almost starting to think maybe my mother-in-law should not go to that English-language class, when she says, “If you think you can stop me from studying English, you can’t! This is America! You can’t!”</p><p>Her eyes glare so hard at my father-in-law that he ducks back into his rice bowl. Not as though he is backing down—more as though he has thought of something else and has some more scratching to do.</p><p>So that is score one point for my mother-in-law.</p><p>Actually, for my mother-in-law English has no use. But she has always wished she could speak English like my father-in-law, who was a literature professor. It was just her bad luck that she took the college-entrance exam in 1977—the first time you could take it after the Cultural Revolution. She is still talking about how fierce the competition was. Two generations, both had to take the examination together, she says. All the teachers and all the students, sitting side by side. She says today she would probably get a top score and go to a top college, like my father-in-law. Because he was smart but also just lucky that he did so well. And he agrees. Some people did well who were not so smart, he says, and some people did not do well, though they were very smart. He agrees that today my mother-in-law would probably be outstanding, especially since, if you don’t like your score, you can try again. So she would probably try eight, nine, ten times! Until she succeeded.</p><p>She is not like Wuji or me, who were not outstanding but did not work so hard, either. We went to third-tier colleges and wished we had scored higher, of course, but did not care so much. Wuji says maybe this was because there was some money in his father’s family, and even I knew ever since high school that Wuji and I would get married. So both of us knew we would have to work hard but would not have to work crazy hard just to live. Also, his parents are kind of like a fire generation. After a fire generation, it is only natural to have a water generation.</p><p>And, actually, my mother-in-law could relax a little, too. But she was always crazy worried when she was growing up, and now she is a person who studies even when it has no use. She says that, now that my father-in-law’s English is declining, if she studies maybe they can meet like two roads. Maybe if her English goes up while his goes down they can meet at an intersection.</p><p>“And then what?” I ask.</p><p>“Then I will wave and say, ‘Hi,’ ” she says, with a wink. “Then I will say, ‘How are you, Professor? I can speak English, too.’ ”</p><p>Of course, it is completely absurd. But it is also sad. I feel sorry for my mother-in-law. It is as if she was born inside a box, so she can never really stand up straight. My mother always says I pity people I should not pity, and she is probably right. She says I am too soft. Because, after all, my mother cannot really stand up straight, either, and at least my mother-in-law has plenty to eat. My mother does not have plenty to eat. Still, when my father-in-law looks up from his rice, ready to fight again, I quickly say, “The baby is kicking!”</p><p>He laughs a little then, as if to say, “You Chinese girls are so obvious.” And, “Why does everyone have to manage me?” But he lets go, too. He does not say anything and he does not fight with my mother-in-law. Because the baby is why they came. They came because Wuji and I are having a baby, and because they could afford to come. They are not like my mother, who has been on her own since my father died and can only Skype. And, of course, no one wants to upset the baby—and if I am upset he will be upset. That is how Chinese people think. One thing always affects something else. So for now we have peace. I reach down and tell the baby, “<em>Sh-h-h</em>, <em>sh-h-h</em>.” He kicks hard on one side, a real boy. Everyone is so happy I am having a boy. And, on the other side, there is his round head. It is soft-hard,<span data-page="page_3"></span> like a volleyball.</p><p>The English teacher recommends an English-language app. My father-in-law tells my mother-in-law, “Do not install it!” Though she can only say a few words so far, already he has had enough of her learning English to compete with him. But while she is out walking he picks up her phone and there it is. A little orange square on the screen.</p><p>“Did you help her?” my father-in-law asks me.</p><p>I nod, because in fact he already knows the answer. My mother-in-law cannot upload, download anything, after all. And Wuji would not dare defy his father to help. But I nod very gently, with both hands on top of my belly.</p><p>“No one can stop her, anyway,” he says then. Meaning, “At least you answered honestly and did not insult my intelligence.”</p><p>I nod again. “She will never stop,” I say.</p><p>“That is true,” he says. And he looks happy just to have this little conversation. To have someone agree with him, the way everyone used to.</p><p>Often, I drive my mother-in-law to the beautiful library, with the glass walls and the café. There are all kinds of people there, including black people and a lot of people you cannot say what color they are. You can only say they like books. My mother-in-law does not mind the people. Every day she finds a DVD to check out so she can practice her English some more after class. And then I pick her up so she can cook for me.</p><p>Actually, I help a lot when she cooks for me. Especially, I help with the shopping and the chopping. But she does the planning and the cooking, because my baby will be born in two months now, and she wants me to eat all kinds of special food. On the outside, my mother-in-law is a modern sportswoman. But inside she is a traditional type. So I take American prenatal vitamins and calcium and DHA, of course. But also she feeds me steamed egg porridge with rice, and millet porridge. I have a glass of milk, red dates, fruit, and nuts every day. Tofu and bean sprouts every other day. And a lot of soups: pork-rib soup with lotus seeds or Chinese yam. Hen soup with mushrooms and more red dates. Soybean-and-pork-trotter soup. Even swallow’s-nest soup, which is very expensive. Because I am in my seventh month and my body has heated up, and because my mother-in-law has an app that says it’s O.K., I am allowed to have some cooling foods I could not have before. For example, some of her blueberries with a little ice cream. In China, there are pregnant women who eat a lot of blueberries. They think it will make their baby’s eyes shiny and round. But my mother-in-law says that is illogical thinking. She will let me have only a few.</p><p>Very important, too, everyone wants me to rest. “Take it easy,” they all say. “Go slow, go slow.” They say, “Rest, rest.” But how can anyone rest when my mother-in-law is cooking and learning English?</p><p>My father-in-law is not as busy as my mother-in-law. But he feels he has to keep up with her. Of course, he used to be very active, too. Wuji says his father used to have so many ideas he had to put a piece of paper next to his bed at night in order to write them all down. Only then could he go back to sleep. And now he still puts a piece of paper next to his bed. But in the morning it is almost always blank. If he writes something, he says he cannot read it. The writing is unclear. When he watches my mother-in-law’s DVDs, too, he nods as if he still understands everything. But then he complains. Why does she have to bring so many DVDs home? And why a new one every night, each one with faster speaking than the last? Another day, he complains she is so active she walks her legs even in her sleep.</p><p>“As if she is going somewhere!” he says.</p><p>Still, to keep up with her my father-in-law moves things around. For example, he does not think the feng-shui of our apartment is very good. So he moves a bookcase to the entrance of the apartment. The bookcase is not that tall, only chest-high. But still it is a help, he says. A small wall inside the front door, to help block evil spirits from coming in. Then he sees that our bookshelves are not well organized. So, one by one, he takes the books and puts them in the correct order. Now we cannot find anything and have to walk around the bookcase to go out.</p><p>He wants to clean everything, too.</p><p>“No need, no need!” we say. “Everything is clean already!”</p><p>But still he cleans the fridge. Then he cleans the stove. Then he cleans the microwave. Next he fixes the bicycles. He oils Wuji’s bike chain. He repairs my bike basket. Actually, there was nothing wrong with my bike basket. Now it is pushed so far to the back, I cannot clip my light on it. But no one can ask him to put it back to where it was or he will say, “Don’t tell me what to do.” We have to do it quietly, by ourselves.</p><p>We are<span data-page="page_4"></span> glad when he is all done.</p><p>One night in bed, Wuji says, “I told them they can stay as long as they like.”</p><p>“How could you promise without talking to me?” I say. “Is that respectful communication? Is that how a husband ought to behave? Does no one consider my feelings? Does my opinion not count at all?”</p><p>Before I was pregnant, I did not talk this way. But it is as if my belly is pressing down on my nerves. The bigger my belly, the more I say. Of course, Wuji is sorry. But do I remember? he asks. I agreed before we got married that his parents could come live with us when they got old. Also, he agreed that my mother could come. Remember? Because we are both only children. Our parents are our responsibility. Yes, he should still have told me he was going to raise the topic. But he didn’t have an opportunity, he says. Because he was trying to calm his parents down.</p><p>“Again,” I say.</p><p>“Yes, again,” he says. “That is my life’s real job. And now I have to calm you down, too. My poor pregnant wife.”</p><p>He puts his hands on my moving belly. The baby kicks him and he laughs. “Hey! So strong!” And then I say I understand. Because I feel sorry for him, that he has so many people to calm down. My mother says I do not realize I will end up a servant to everyone. “Soft and capable, the worst combination,” she says. “You will serve everyone, and no one will serve you.” Is that true? Maybe it is a mistake to tell Wuji he is right. Maybe it is a mistake to admit my pregnancy is making me talk crazy. Maybe it is a mistake to say I do not want to make trouble for him. But still I say, “Poor Wuji.” Maybe because, inside, I think, This is the best way for my child.</p><p>“At least, if they move here we can buy a bigger place,” he says. “There is that advantage to living in the United States. There is room here. It’s not like China.”</p><p>“That is true,” I say. “There is that advantage.”</p><p>“Plus, you know, even if we all buy a place together they might not move in right away,” Wuji says. “Maybe they won’t, right? We don’t know.”</p><p>“Maybe not,” I agree. “You’re right. We don’t know.”</p><p>“And maybe they won’t really like it here, anyway,” Wuji says. “Maybe they’ll miss China and want to go back. Or maybe they’ll go back and forth. A lot of people do that. Go back and forth.”</p><p>“You’re right,” I say. “A lot of people do do that. Maybe they will, too.”</p><p>“Plus, maybe my father will be fine. We don’t know, right? Maybe my mother will be able to handle him herself.”</p><p>“Maybe he will,” I say. “And maybe she will indeed be able to handle him by herself. It’s hard to say. You’re right.”</p><p>In China, I had a clothes store. Not a very big store—in fact, quite a small store. Still, my friends would make clothes and I would sell them, and we always made a little money. Because I figured everything out so well, my friends said. Because I made everything so smooth. Though, actually, their designs were outstanding, too. Then Wuji went to the U.S. for his doctorate, and I went with him. Now my store is like a beautiful picture I once saw, a long, long time ago, on Taobao. At first, my friends said they would send me clothes and I could sell them here. So I could still have a store.</p><p>“I’m not sure. Maybe the Americans will not like the clothes,” I said at first.</p><p>Then, later, I said, “I think the Americans maybe do not like them.”</p><p>And now I say, “The Americans just do not like our clothes.”</p><p>No more maybe, in other words. Because that is just what happens. One day it is maybe, and then you just know.</p><p>My father-in-law says maybe he will wash Wuji’s car.</p><p>Of course, he knows that Wuji bought a silver-colored car. Also, he has been in Wuji’s silver car several times. Once, he tested the air-conditioning. Once, he told Wuji he was surprised there was no screen to show you how far away you are from the car behind you. Because all the children of his friends who had cars had that kind of screen, he said. Very useful. Of course, he understands that, in terms of technology, the United States is often quite backward. He knows that in the United States many people still use cash, for example. Still, he said, he was surprised.</p><p>Wuji agreed then that the United States was backward. But his car had no screen, he said, because his car was a used car.</p><p>“Ah,” his father said.</p><p>“My car is an old model. Too old to have that kind of screen,” Wuji said.</p><p>“Ah,” his father said again. Then he said, “It is because you are only a lecturer. It is because you are not a professor.”</p><p>“Yes,” Wuji said. “A lecturer’s salary is quite low.”</p><p>He was calm, because in fact he already knew what his father thought. Also, in his heart he would like to be a professor, too.</p><p>Still, my mother-in-law said, “Wuji is<span data-page="page_5"></span> just as successful as the other sons! He got his Ph.D. in America! And at least he is not a volleyball coach, right?”</p><p>“Wuji jumps like an elephant,” my father-in-law said. “He is so slow he has to wave the flies away; he cannot swat them. I do not think he could have become a volleyball coach.”</p><p>If Wuji was not the ump in the family, maybe he would feel bad. But, instead, he calmly said, “I am not a coach and I am not a professor. I cannot jump and, truly, I am slow. But I am going to be a father.”</p><p>And my father-in-law agreed then that Wuji had accomplished at least one important thing. Because a child born in America is a U.S. citizen. And a U.S. citizen can do anything!</p><p>“He is a success!” my mother-in-law said.</p><p>My father-in-law nodded.</p><p>But now, somehow, when my father-in-law cleans the car, and we go out to the parking lot to inspect it, Wuji’s car does not look all clean and shiny.</p><p>“Beautiful!” we say, though we can see that it is not only just as old as before but still quite dirty.</p><p>Then my mother-in-law whispers, “Look!”</p><p>And that is when we see that the silver car across from Wuji’s car is all clean. Should we point out that Wuji’s car is a Nissan, and that car is a Toyota?</p><p>Not even my mother-in-law will try to score that point.</p><p>For two days we say nothing. I knit some baby clothes. I water some plants. I help cook. I eat. My mother-in-law has found a special oatmeal place near our house and is interested in the grain, which is milled very fine. It is not like regular oatmeal, she says. It is more like millet. She serves it to me with soy sauce and sesame oil.</p><p>“Good for the baby,” she says.</p><p>Meanwhile, the shiny car does not move. Every time we go out, it is still there in the parking lot. Clean.</p><p>The third day, my father-in-law washes Wuji’s car.</p><p>We go outside again. We stand on the cracked asphalt.</p><p>“Beautiful!” we say. As if we did not say that the other day.</p><p>My father-in-law makes a kind of flower blossom with his lips. Then suddenly his eyes light up and he says, “Is there another silver car I can clean tomorrow?”</p><p>We laugh. We laugh because it is funny. We laugh because we are relieved. And we laugh because we want to cry. Because there he is—the man he was before his hair got so long. The man who made jokes and did not argue all day with his wife.</p><p>So what to do now about the first clean car? Should we write a note and put it on the windshield? And, if we do, what should the note say?</p><p>“It should say, ‘We are so sorry we cleaned the wrong car, but we are from China,’ ” my father-in-law suggests. “It should say, ‘We older people especially only know a few brands of cars. For example, BMW.’ ”</p><p>We laugh.</p><p>My father-in-law says, “Or else we can write, ‘Those Japanese cars, you know, they all look the same.’ ”</p><p>We laugh again.</p><p>But Wuji thinks it would be a mistake to write anything.</p><p>“You are right, we can write a note,” he says. “That is one approach. But American people don’t like people to touch their things. If they find a dent or a scratch or anything wrong, they will complain. If they can, they will even sue you. So I recommend we not write anything.”</p><p>Everyone is quiet. Will my father-in-law feel Wuji is telling him what to do?</p><p>“Don’t tell me what to do,” he says.</p><p>In the end, though, he follows Wuji’s recommendation and does not write anything.</p><p>The next day, the doorbell rings. Outside, there is a short black man with a cardboard box. We cannot see him too well because of the bookcase and also the screen door. But we can see that, actually, he is not really black. Actually, he is a rust color, kind of like a fall chrysanthemum. He is wearing bluejeans and a T-shirt, and he is very similar in size to my father-in-law, except for his shoulders and his arms. My father-in-law is quite thin. This man’s muscles bulge out. He is wearing a gold earring, too, kind of like the Buddha, only just one earring, instead of two.</p><p>“Hi, my name is Jeff,” he says through the screen. “I heard you cleaned my car.”</p><p>He looks friendly. Still, my father-in-law stands between the bookcase and the door as if this Jeff is an evil spirit the bookcase might not be strong enough to keep out. My father-in-law is holding hard on to the apartment doorknob as if to brace himself. He does not open the screen door.</p><p>“We did not clean anything,” he says in English. He speaks slowly and clearly.</p><p>Jeff raises his eyebrows so high, three deep creases appear on his forehead. The rolls of skin between them look like dragons.</p><p>“But our neighbors said they saw you out with a bucket and a sponge,” he says. “I just wanted to say thank you.”</p><p>Out of all this, my mother-in-law only gets the “thank you.” But, as she has been practicing in English class, she cries, “You’re welcome!”—spiking the words like<span data-page="page_final"></span> a volleyball across the room.</p><p>Does Jeff feel encouraged by her words? Anyway, he starts again.</p><p>“I just wanted to say thank you,” he repeats. “I brought you a present.”</p><p>We think maybe my father-in-law needs more time to prepare. But we cannot help him. And sure enough, he says, slowly but clearly, “Is that really your car?”</p><p>Maybe he is just surprised. A black man with a newer car than Wuji’s. And who knows? Maybe this black man has a screen to show him what is behind the car when he is backing up.</p><p>But Jeff thinks something else.</p><p>“Did I steal it? Is that what you mean?” Jeff says.</p><p>“If you find something wrong, we did not do it,” my father-in-law says.</p><p>“There’s nothing wrong,” Jeff says.</p><p>“We did not wash your car,” my father-in-law says. His hand is still holding on to the doorknob. “You have no proof.”</p><p>“Is that so?” Jeff gives my father-in-law a funny look. Then finally he says, “You know what I’m going to do? I’m going to leave this cake here anyway.”</p><p>He opens the screen door.</p><p>“Stop!” my father-in-law says.</p><p>But one foot is already inside. Jeff holds the screen door still with his shoulder. Then he opens the lid of the cake box. He props the box on his knee as he writes quickly in the icing with his finger. Then he closes the box and licks his fingertip.</p><p>“Here,” he says. He hands the box to my father-in-law.</p><p>My father-in-law does not accept it.</p><p>“Take it,” Jeff says.</p><p>My father-in-law does not move.</p><p>“I said take it,” Jeff says again.</p><p>“Take it,” Wuji says from behind the bookcase, in Chinese.</p><p>“Don’t tell me what to do,” my father-in-law says. But he takes the box.</p><p>Jeff leaves, muttering something we cannot hear.</p><p>We lock the knob and the bolt, then put the chain on, too.</p><p>Later, at dinner, we can see that although the cake originally said “<em class="small">THANK YOU</em>!” on it in fancy blue letters, on top of that is now something else.</p><p>“ ‘Fucking As,’ ” my father-in-law says. “ ‘Fucking As.’ ” He frowns.</p><p>“I think it means, ‘Fucking Asians,’ ” Wuji says.</p><p>My father-in-law still looks confused.</p><p>“The blacks do not like us,” Wuji explains. “Because we are too smart.”</p><p>“Also, we do not spend money like crazy,” my mother-in-law says.</p><p>“They are afraid China is going to surpass America,” I say.</p><p>“ ‘Fucking Asians,’ ” my father-in-law says. Then suddenly he says, “I saw that there were two cars. But I thought Wuji’s car must be the new car.”</p><p>He says, “I was confused.”</p><p>He says, “A lot of English I do not understand anymore.”</p><p>This should be my mother-in-law’s happiest moment. Finally, she and my father-in-law have met at an intersection. This is the moment she can wave and say, “Hi! How are you, Professor? I can speak English, too!” But, instead, she is looking down through the bottom of her bifocals. She is batting back tears.</p><p>No one moves. Only the baby is turning over and over, as if he is in a washing machine.</p><p>“We should give the cake back,” Wuji says after a while.</p><p>“We should serve the cake into that man’s windshield!” my mother-in-law says. She holds her hands as if she is ready to toss the cake into the air and punch it.</p><p>“Good idea,” Wuji says.</p><p>On the way out of the apartment, he carries the cake up high, as if he is in a parade.</p><p>“Make sure you hit the Toyota!” my father-in-law jokes in English. “Make sure you don’t hit the Nissan!”</p><p>Everyone laughs.</p><p>But Jeff’s car is not there. So, when we come back in, we still have the cake.</p><p>“Maybe we should scrape off the frosting and see how it looks,” I say.</p><p>“Good idea,” Wuji says.</p><p>We scrape off the words and, sure enough, the cake looks better. My mother-in-law says, “We should have it with blueberries!” And, in the end, even I get three berries.</p><p>Then we turn on the DVD player. The DVD today is “The Sound of Music.”</p><p>My father-in-law nods, getting ready to explain everything. He has seen this movie before and knows the story. He is prepared. Of course, in fact we have all seen it. We all know about the children and Maria, and about the brave father who manages the situation so well.</p><p>Still, I say, “ ‘The Sound of Music!’ ” as if it is something new.</p><p>My father-in-law smiles.</p><p>Am I being too obvious? Am I insulting his intelligence?</p><p>“You will be a good mother,” he says. “You will manage things very well for your child.” He stops. “And then one day your child will have to manage you.”</p><p>And now it is my turn to cry. I cry because he is right. I cry because I am sorry. And I cry because there he is, one more time, under the crazy, wild hair. The professor who knows everything. The professor we will all miss. ♦</p>	Gish Jen	March 19, 2018 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/19/no-more-maybe	Aging	Parents	China	Immigrants	Race		Unnamed	First	Immigrants
Of Windows and Doors	<p>War <span data-page="page_1"></span>in Saeed and Nadia’s city revealed itself to be an intimate experience, combatants pressed close together, front lines defined at the level of the street one took to work, the school one’s sister attended, the house of one’s aunt’s best friend, the shop where one bought cigarettes. Saeed’s mother thought she saw a former student of hers firing, with much determination and focus, a machine gun mounted on the back of a pickup truck. She looked at him and he looked at her but he did not turn and shoot her, so she suspected it was him, although Saeed’s father said it meant nothing more than that she had seen a man who wished to fire in another direction. She remembered the boy as shy, with a stutter and a quick mind for mathematics, a good boy, but she could not remember his name. She wondered if it had really been him, and whether she should feel alarmed or relieved if it had. If the militants won, she supposed, it might not be entirely bad to know some people on their side.</p><p>Neighborhoods fell to the militants in startlingly quick succession, so that Saeed’s mother’s mental map of the city where she had spent her entire life now resembled an old quilt, with patches of government land and patches of militant land. The frayed seams between the patches were the most deadly spaces, to be avoided at all costs. Her butcher and the man who dyed the fabrics from which she had once made her festive clothes disappeared into such gaps, their places of business reduced to rubble and glass.</p><p>People vanished in those days, and for the most part one did not know, at least not for a while, if they were alive or dead. Nadia had been estranged from her family since she had completed university and announced, to their anger and fear and dismay, that she would henceforth live on her own. She passed their house one afternoon on purpose, not to speak with them, just to see from the outside if they were there and well, but the home she had forsaken looked deserted, with no sign of inhabitants or life. When she visited again, it was gone, unrecognizable, the building crushed by the force of a bomb that weighed as much as a compact automobile. Nadia would never be able to determine what had become of her family, but she always hoped that they had found a way to depart unharmed, abandoning the city to the predations of warriors on both sides, who seemed content to flatten it in order to possess it.</p><p>Nadia resided alone, and Saeed with his parents, but both were fortunate that their homes remained for a while in government-controlled neighborhoods, and so were spared much of the worst fighting and also the retaliatory air strikes that the Army was calling in on localities thought not merely to be occupied but disloyal.</p><p>They had met three months earlier, when the city was not yet openly at war. It might seem odd that in cities teetering at the edge of the abyss young people still go to class—in this case an evening class on corporate identity and product branding—but that is the way of things, with cities as with life. One moment we are pottering about our errands as usual and the next we are dying, and our eternally impending ending does not put a stop to our transient beginnings and middles until the instant when it does.</p><p>Their class had not resumed after the recent assault on the city’s stock exchange. Now Saeed’s boss had tears in his eyes as he told his employees that he had to shutter his business, apologizing for letting them down and promising that there would be jobs for them all when things improved and the agency was able to reopen. He was so distraught that it seemed to those collecting their final salaries that they were in fact consoling him. All agreed that he was a fine and delicate man, worryingly so, for these were not times for such men.</p><p>At Nadia’s office, the payroll department ceased giving out checks, and within days everyone stopped coming to work. There were no real goodbyes, or at least none that she was part of, and since the security guards were the first to melt away, a sort of calm looting, or remuneration in hardware, began, and people left with what they could carry.</p><p>One’s relationship to windows changed in the city. A window was the border through which death was possibly likeliest to come. Windows could not stop even the most flagging round of ammunition: any spot indoors with a view of the outside was a spot potentially in the crossfire. Moreover, a windowpane itself could so easily become shrapnel, shattered by a nearby blast, and everyone had heard of someone or other who had bled out after being lacerated by shards of flying glass.</p><p>Many windows were broken already, and the prudent thing would have been to remove those which remained, but it was winter and the nights were cold, and without gas and electricity, both of which were in increasingly short supply, windows served to take some of the edge off the chill, and so people left them in place.</p><p>Saeed and his family rearranged their furniture instead. They placed bookshelves full<span data-page="page_2"></span> of books against the windows in their bedrooms, blocking the glass from sight but allowing light to creep in around the edges, and they leaned Saeed’s bed over the tall windows in their sitting room, mattress and all, upright, at an angle, so that the bed’s feet rested on the lintel. Saeed slept on three rugs layered on the floor, which he told his parents suited his back.</p><p>Nadia taped the inside of her windows with beige packing tape, the sort normally used to seal cardboard boxes, and hammered heavy-duty rubbish bags into place over them, pounding nails into the window frames. When she’d had enough electricity to charge her backup battery, she would lounge around and listen to her records in the light of a single bare bulb, the harsh sounds of the fighting muffled somewhat by the music, and she would then glance at her windows and think that they looked a bit like amorphous black works of contemporary art.</p><p>The effect doors had on people altered as well. Rumors had begun to circulate of doors that could take you elsewhere, often to places far away, well removed from this death trap of a country. Some people claimed to know people who knew people who had been through such doors. A normal door, they said, could become a special door, and it could happen, without warning, to any door at all. Most people thought these rumors to be nonsense, the superstitions of the feeble-minded. But most people began to gaze at their own doors a little differently nonetheless.</p><p>Nadia and Saeed, too, discussed these rumors and dismissed them. But every morning, when she woke, Nadia looked over at her front door, and at the doors to her bathroom, her closet, her terrace. Every morning, in his room, Saeed did much the same. All their doors remained simple doors, on-off switches in the flow between two adjacent places, binarily either open or closed, but each door, regarded thus with a twinge of irrational possibility, became partially animate as well, an object with a subtle power to mock—to mock the desires of those who desired to go far away, whispering silently from its doorframe that such dreams were the dreams of fools.</p><p>Without work, there was no impediment to Saeed and Nadia meeting during the day except for the fighting, but that impediment was a serious one. The few local television channels still on the air were saying that the war was going well, but the international ones were saying that it was going badly indeed, adding to an unprecedented flow of migrants hitting the rich countries, which were building walls and fences and strengthening their borders, but seemingly to unsatisfactory effect. The militants had their own pirate radio station, featuring an announcer with a deep and unnervingly sexy voice, who spoke slowly and deliberately, and claimed in a decelerated but almost raplike cadence that the fall of the city was imminent. Whatever the truth, being out and about was risky, so Saeed and Nadia typically met at Nadia’s place.</p><p>Saeed had once more asked her to move in with him and his family, telling her that he could explain things to his parents, and she could have his room, and he would sleep in the sitting room, and they would not have to marry, they would only, out of respect for his parents, have to remain chaste in the house, and it would be safer for her, for this was no time for anyone to be alone. He had not added that it was especially unsafe for a woman to be alone, but she knew both that he thought it and that it was true, even as she parried his suggestion. He could see that the subject unsettled her, so he did not raise it again, but the offer stood, and she considered it.</p><p>Nadia was herself coming to acknowledge that this was no longer a city where the risks facing a young woman living independently could be thought of as manageable, and, equally important, she worried for Saeed each time he drove over to see her and then again when he returned home. But she might have waited much longer had Saeed’s mother not been killed, a stray heavy-calibre round passing through the windshield of her car and taking with it a quarter of her head, not while she was driving, for she had not driven in months, but while she was checking inside for an earring she thought she had misplaced, and Nadia, seeing the state that Saeed and Saeed’s father were in when she came to their apartment for the first time, on the day of the funeral, stayed with them that night to offer what comfort and help she could, and did not spend another night in her own apartment.</p><p>Nadia slept in what had been Saeed’s room, on a pile of carpets and blankets on the floor, having refused Saeed’s father’s offer to give up his bed, and Saeed slept on a similar, though thinner, pile in the sitting room, and Saeed’s father slept by himself in his bedroom, a room where he had slept for most of his life, though he could not recall the last instance he had slept alone, and for this reason the room was no longer completely familiar to him.</p><p>Saeed’s neighborhood had fallen to the militants and<span data-page="page_3"></span> small-scale fighting had diminished in the area, but large bombs still dropped from the sky and exploded with an awesome power that brought to mind the might of nature itself. Saeed was grateful for Nadia’s presence, for the way in which she altered the silences that descended on the apartment, not necessarily filling them with words but making them less bleak in their muteness. And he was grateful, too, for her effect on his father, whose politeness, when he recalled that he was in the company of a young woman, would jar him from what otherwise were interminable reveries and would bring his attention back for a while to the here and now. Saeed wished that Nadia had been able to meet his mother, and his mother able to meet her.</p><p>Sometimes, when Saeed’s father had gone to sleep, Saeed and Nadia sat together in the sitting room, their sides pressed close for connection and warmth, perhaps holding hands, at most exchanging a kiss on the cheek as a farewell before bed, and often they were silent, but often they spoke in low voices, about how to escape from the city, or about the endless rumors of the doors.</p><p>On one occasion, the militants came, banging on the front door in the middle of the night. They were looking for people of a particular sect, and demanded to see I.D. cards, to check what sort of name everyone had, but, fortunately for Saeed’s father and Saeed and Nadia, their names were not associated with the denomination being hunted. The neighbors upstairs were not so lucky: the husband was held down while his throat was cut, the wife and daughter were hauled out and away.</p><p>The dead neighbor bled through a crack in the floor, his blood appearing as a stain in the corner of Saeed’s sitting-room ceiling, and Saeed and Nadia, who had heard the family’s screams, went up to collect and bury him, as soon as they dared, but his body was gone, presumably taken by his executioners, and his blood was already fairly dry, a patch like a painted puddle in his apartment, an uneven trail on the stairs.</p><p>The following night, or perhaps the night after that, Saeed entered Nadia’s room and they were unchaste there for the first time. A combination of horror and desire subsequently impelled him back each evening, despite his earlier resolution that they do nothing that was disrespectful to his parents, and they would touch and stroke and taste, always stopping short of sex, to which he remained as ever morally opposed—and which they had by now found ample means to circumvent. His mother was no more, and his father seemed not to concern himself with these romantic matters, and so they proceeded in secret, and the fact that unmarried lovers such as they were now being made examples of and punished by death created a semi-terrified urgency and edge to each coupling that sometimes bordered on a strange sort of ecstasy.</p><p>As the militants secured the city, extinguishing the last large salients of resistance, a partial calm descended, broken by the activities of drones and aircraft that bombed from the heavens, and by the public and private executions that now took place almost continuously, bodies hanging from street lamps and billboards like a form of festive seasonal decoration. The executions moved in waves, and once a neighborhood had been purged it could then expect a measure of respite, until someone committed an infraction of some kind, because infractions, although often alleged with a degree of randomness, were invariably punished without mercy.</p><p>Saeed’s father went each day to the home of a cousin who was like an elder brother to him and his surviving siblings, and there he sat, with the old men and old women, and drank tea and coffee and discussed the past, and they all knew Saeed’s mother well and had stories to relate in which she featured prominently, and while Saeed’s father was with them he felt not that his wife was alive, for the magnitude of her death impressed itself upon him again with every morning, but, rather, that he could share some small portion of her company.</p><p>Saeed’s father tarried at her grave each evening on the way home. Once, he saw some young boys playing football and this cheered him, and reminded him of his own skill at the game when he was their age. Then he realized that they were not young boys but teen-agers, young men, and they were playing not with a ball but with the severed head of a goat, and he thought, Barbarians, but then it dawned on him that this was the head not of a goat but of a human being, with hair and a beard, and he wanted to believe that he was mistaken, that the light was failing and his eyes were playing tricks on him, and that was what he told himself, as he tried not to look again, but something about the young men’s expressions left him in little doubt of the truth.</p><p>Saeed and Nadia, meanwhile, had dedicated themselves single-mindedly to finding a way out of the city, and, as the overland routes were widely deemed too perilous to attempt, this meant investigating the possibility of securing passage through the doors, in which most people seemed<span data-page="page_4"></span> now to believe, especially since any attempt to use one or keep one secret had been declared by the militants to be punishable, as usual, by death, and also because those with shortwave radios claimed that even the most reputable international broadcasters had acknowledged the doors’ existence, and indeed they were being discussed by world leaders as a major global crisis.</p><p>Following a tip from a friend, Saeed and Nadia headed out on foot one evening at dusk. They were dressed in accordance with the rules on dress and he was bearded in accordance with the rules on beards and her hair was hidden in accordance with the rules on hair, but nonetheless they stayed in the margins of the roads, in the shadows as much as possible, trying not to be seen while trying not to look like they were trying not to be seen. They passed a body dangling from a signpost and could barely smell it until they were downwind, when the odor became almost unbearable.</p><p>Because of the flying robots high above in the darkening sky, unseen but never far from people’s minds, Saeed walked with a slight hunch, as though cringing at the thought of the bomb or missile that one of them might at any moment dispatch. By contrast, because she wanted not to appear guilty, Nadia walked tall, so that if they were stopped and their I.D. cards were checked and it was pointed out that her card did not list him as her husband, she would be more believable when she led the questioners home and presented their forged marriage certificate.</p><p>The man they were looking for called himself an agent, though it was unclear if this was owing to his specializing in travel or to his operating in secret or to some other reason, and they were to meet him in the labyrinthine gloom of a burned-out shopping center, a ruin with innumerable exits and hiding places, which made Saeed wish he had insisted that Nadia not come and made Nadia wish that they had brought a flashlight or, failing that, a knife. They stood, barely able to see, and waited with mounting unease.</p><p>They did not hear the agent approaching—or perhaps he had been there all along—and they were startled by his voice just behind them. The agent spoke softly, almost sweetly, his whisper bringing to mind that of a poet or a psychopath. He instructed them to stand still and not to turn around. He told Nadia to uncover her head, and when she asked why he said it was not a request.</p><p>Nadia had the sense that he was extremely close to her, as if he were about to touch her neck, but she could not hear his breathing. There was a faint sound in the distance, and she and Saeed realized that the agent might not be alone. Saeed asked where the door was and where it led to, and the agent replied that the doors were everywhere, but finding one the militants had not yet found, a door not yet guarded, that was the trick, and might take a while. The agent demanded their money and Saeed gave it to him, uncertain whether they were making a down payment or being robbed.</p><p>As they hurried home, Saeed and Nadia looked at the night sky, at the forcefulness of the stars and the moon’s pockmarked brightness in the absence of electric lighting and in the reduced pollution from fuel-starved and hence sparse traffic. They wondered where the door to which they had purchased access might take them, someplace in the mountains or on the plains or by the seaside. In their apartment, they told Saeed’s father the potential good news, but he was oddly silent in response. They waited for him to say something, and in the end all he said was “Let us hope.”</p><p>As the days passed, and Saeed and Nadia did not hear from the agent again, they increasingly questioned whether they would hear from him at all. It might seem surprising that even in such circumstances Saeed’s and Nadia’s attitudes toward finding a way out were not entirely straightforward. Saeed desperately wanted to leave his city, in a sense he always had, but in his imagination he had thought he would leave it only temporarily, intermittently, never once and for all, and this looming potential departure was altogether different, for he doubted he would come back, and the scattering of his extended family and his circle of friends and acquaintances, forever, struck him as deeply sad, as amounting to the loss of a home, no less—of his home.</p><p>Nadia was possibly even more feverishly keen to depart, and her nature was such that the prospect of something new, of change, was at its most basic level exciting to her. But she was haunted by worries, too, revolving around dependence, worries that in going abroad and leaving their country she and Saeed and Saeed’s father might be at the mercy of strangers, subsisting on handouts, caged in pens like vermin.</p><p>Whatever their misgivings, neither of them had any doubt that they would leave if given the chance. And so neither expected, when a handwritten note from the agent arrived, pushed under the apartment door one morning and telling them precisely where to be at precisely what time the following afternoon, that Saeed’s father<span data-page="page_5"></span> would say, “You two must go, but I will not come.”</p><p>Saeed and Nadia said this was impossible, and explained, in case he had misunderstood, that there was no problem, that they had paid the agent for three passages and would all be leaving together, and Saeed’s father heard them out but would not be budged: they, he repeated, had to go, and he had to stay. Saeed threatened to carry his father over his shoulder if he needed to. He had never spoken to his father in this way, and his father took him aside, for he could see the pain he was causing his son, and when Saeed asked why his father was doing this, what could possibly make him want to stay, Saeed’s father said, “Your mother is here.”</p><p>Saeed said, “Mother is gone.”</p><p>His father said, “Not for me.”</p><p>And this was true, in a way. He preferred to abide in the past, for the past offered more to him. But Saeed’s father was thinking also of the future, even though he did not say this to Saeed, for he feared if he said this to his son that his son might not go, and he knew above all else that his son must go, and what he did not say was that he had come to that point in a parent’s life when, if a flood arrives, one knows one must let go of one’s child, contrary to all the instincts one had when one was younger, because holding on can no longer offer the child protection, it can only pull the child down and threaten him with drowning, for the child is now stronger than the parent, and the circumstances are such that the utmost strength is required, and the arc of a child’s life appears only for a while to match the arc of a parent’s, in reality, one sits atop the other, a hill atop a hill, a curve atop a curve, and Saeed’s father’s arc now needed to curve lower, while his son’s still curved higher, for with an old man hampering them these two young people were simply less likely to survive.</p><p>Saeed’s father told his son he loved him and said that Saeed must not disobey him in this, that he had never believed in commanding his son but in this moment was doing so, that only death awaited Saeed and Nadia in this city, and that one day, when things were better, Saeed would come back to him, and both men knew as this was said that it would not happen, that Saeed would not be able to return while his father still lived.</p><p>Saeed’s father then summoned Nadia into his room and spoke to her without Saeed and said that he was entrusting her with his son’s life, and she, whom he called daughter, must, like a daughter, not fail him, whom she called father, and she must see Saeed through to safety, and he hoped she would one day marry his son and be called mother by his grandchildren, but this was up to them to decide, and all he asked was that she remain by Saeed’s side until Saeed was out of danger, and he asked her to promise this to him. He said it softly, like a prayer, and she sat there with him in silence and the minutes passed, and in the end she promised, and it was an easy promise to make, because she had at that time no thoughts of leaving Saeed, but it was also a difficult one, because in making it she felt she was abandoning the old man, and so by making the promise he demanded she make she was in a sense killing him, but that is the way of things, for when we migrate we murder from our lives those we leave behind.</p><p>The walk to the rendezvous point was an interminable one, and as they walked Saeed and Nadia did not hold hands, for that was forbidden in public between genders, even for an ostensibly married couple, but from time to time their knuckles would brush at their sides, and this sporadic physical contact was important to them. They knew there was a possibility that the agent had sold them out to the militants, and so they knew there was a possibility that this was the final afternoon of their lives.</p><p>The rendezvous point was in a converted house next to a market. On the ground floor was a dentist’s clinic, long lacking medicines and painkillers, and as of yesterday lacking a dentist as well, and in the dentist’s waiting room they had a shock because a man who looked like a militant was standing there, assault rifle slung over his shoulder. But he merely took the balance of their payment and told them to sit, and so they sat in that crowded room with a frightened couple and their two school-age children, and a young man in glasses, and an older woman who was perched erectly on her seat as if she came from money, even though her clothes were dirty, and every few minutes someone was summoned through to the dentist’s office itself, and after Nadia and Saeed were summoned they saw a slender man who also looked like a militant, and was picking at the edge of his nostril with a<span data-page="page_6"></span> fingernail, as though toying with a callus, or strumming a musical instrument, and when he spoke they heard his peculiarly soft voice and knew at once that he was the agent they had met before.</p><p>The room was gloomy, and the dentist’s chair and tools resembled a torture station. The agent gestured with his head to the blackness of a door that had once led to a supply closet and said to Saeed, “You go first,” but Saeed, who had until then thought he would go first, to make sure it was safe for Nadia to follow, now changed his mind, thinking it possibly more dangerous for her to remain behind while he went through, and said, “No, she will.”</p><p>The agent shrugged as if it were of no consequence to him, and Nadia, who had not considered the order of their departure until that moment, and realized that there were risks to each, to going first and to going second, did not argue but approached the door, and drawing close she was struck by its darkness, its opacity, the way that it did not reveal what was on the other side and also did not reflect what was on this side, and so felt equally like a beginning and an end, and she turned to Saeed and found him staring at her, and his face was full of worry and sorrow, and she took his hands in hers and held them tight, and then, releasing them, and without a word, she stepped through.</p><p>It was said in those days that the passage was both like dying and like being born, and indeed Nadia experienced a kind of extinguishing as she entered the blackness and a gasping struggle as she fought to exit it, and she felt cold and bruised and damp as she lay on the floor of the room on the other side, trembling and too spent at first to stand, and she thought, while she strained to fill her lungs, that this dampness must be her own sweat.</p><p>Saeed was emerging, and Nadia crawled forward to give him room, and as she did so she noticed the sinks and mirrors for the first time, the tiles of the floor, the stalls behind her, all the doors of which save one were normal doors, all but the one through which she had come, and through which Saeed was now coming, which was black, and she understood that she was in the bathroom of some public place, and she listened intently but it was silent, the only noises emanating from her, from her breathing, and from Saeed, his quiet grunts like those of a man exercising, or having sex.</p><p>They embraced without getting to their feet, and she cradled him, for he was still weak, and when they were strong enough they rose, and she saw Saeed pivot back to the door, as though he wished maybe to reverse course and return through it, and she stood beside him without speaking, and he was motionless for a while, but then he strode forward and they made their way outside and found themselves between two low buildings, perceiving a sound like a shell held to their ears and feeling a cold breeze on their faces and smelling brine in the air, and they looked and saw a stretch of sand and gray waves coming in, and it seemed miraculous, although it was not a miracle, they were merely on a beach.</p><p>The beach was fronted by a beach club, with bars and tables and large outdoor loudspeakers and loungers stacked away for winter. Its signs were written in English and also in other European tongues. It seemed deserted, and Saeed and Nadia went and stood by the sea, the water stopping just short of their feet and sinking into the sand, leaving lines in the smoothness like those of expired soap bubbles blown by a parent for a child. After a while, a pale-skinned man with light-brown hair came out of the club and told them to move along, making shooing gestures with his hands, but without any hostility or particular rudeness, more as though he were conversing in an international pidgin dialect of sign language.</p><p>They walked away from the beach club, and in the lee of a hill they saw what looked like a refugee camp, with hundreds of tents and lean-tos and people of many colors and hues—many colors and hues but mostly falling within a band of brown that ranged from dark chocolate to milky tea—and these people were gathered around fires that burned inside upright oil drums and were speaking in a cacophony that was the languages of the world, what one might hear if one were a communications satellite, or a spymaster tapping into a fibre-optic cable under the sea.</p><p>In this group, everyone was foreign, and so, in a sense, no one was. Nadia and Saeed quickly located a cluster of fellow countrywomen and men and learned that they were on the Greek island of Mykonos, a great draw for tourists in the summer, and, it seemed, a great draw for migrants this winter, and that the doors out, which is to say the doors to richer destinations, were heavily guarded, but the doors in, the doors from poorer places, were mostly left unsecured, perhaps in the hope that people would go<span data-page="page_final"></span> back to where they came from—although almost no one ever did—or perhaps because there were simply too many doors from too many poorer places.</p><p>Too many to guard them all. ♦</p>	Mohsin Hamid	November 14, 2016 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/11/14/of-windows-and-doors	Aleppo	Books	Couples	Emigration	Love	Middle East	Saeed	Third	Immigrants
Oktober	<p>I <span data-page="page_1"></span>sat drinking black tea in the foyer of the hotel. (This was in Munich.) A lady wearing a lustrous purple trouser suit was seated at the keys of the baby grand in the far corner, her rendition of “Hungarian Rhapsody” (with many adornments and curlicues) for now unable to drown out the inarticulate howling and baying from the bar beyond the lifts. It was the time of Oktoberfest, and the city was playing host to six million visitors, thereby quintupling its population—visitors from all over Bavaria, and from all over Germany, and from all over the world. Other visitors, a far smaller contingent, were also expected, visitors who hoped to stay, and to stay indefinitely; they were coming from what was once known as the Fertile Crescent.</p><p>“Let’s see if we can make a bit of sense of this,” an itinerant businessman was bleakly saying, bent over his mobile phone two tables away, with clipboard, legal pad, gaping laptop. He spoke in the only language I could understand—English—and his accent derived from northern regions, northern cities (Hull, Leeds, Grimsby). “I should’ve rung two weeks ago. Three. All right, a month ago. But that doesn’t affect the matter at hand, now does it? Believe me, the only thing that’s kept me back’s the prospect of having to . . . Listen. Are you listening to me? We need to resolve the indemnity clause. Clause 4C.” He sighed. “Have you got the paperwork in front of you at least? Quite honestly, it beats me how you get anything done. I’m a busy man and I’m accustomed to dealing with people who have some idea of what they’re up to. Will you listen? Will you listen?”</p><p>The photographer arrived, and after a minute he and I went out into the street. In great numbers, the Oktoberfesters were streaming past, the women in cinched dirndls and wenchy blouses, the men in suède or leather breeches laced just below the knee, tight jackets studded with medals or badges, and jaunty little hats with feathers, rosettes, cockades. On the pavement, Bernhardt erected his tripod and his tilted umbrella, and I prepared myself to enter the usual trance of inanition—forgetting that in this part of Eurasia, at least for now, there was no longer any small talk. But first I said, “What do they actually do in that park of theirs?”</p><p>“In the funfair?” Bernhardt smiled with a touch of skeptical fondness. “A lot of drinking. A lot of eating. And singing. And dancing—if you can call it that. On tabletops.”</p><p>“Sort of clumping about?”</p><p>“The word is <em>schunkeln</em>. They link arms and sway while they sing. From side to side. Thousands of them.”</p><p>“<em>Schunkeln</em>’s the infinitive, right? How d’you spell that?”</p><p>“I’ll write it down for you. Yes, the infinitive.”</p><p>Our session began. Broad-shouldered and stubbly but also delicately handsome, Bernhardt was an Iranian-German (his family had come over in the nineteen-fifties); he was also very quick and courteous, and, of course, seamlessly fluent.</p><p>“Last week I came by train from Salzburg,” he said as he began wrapping up. “There were eight hundred refugees on board.”</p><p>“Eight hundred. And how were they?”</p><p>“Very tired. And hungry. And dirty. Some with children, some with old people. They all want to get to this country because they have friends and family here. Germany is trying to be welcoming, trying to be kind, but . . . I took many photographs. If you like I’ll drop some off for you.”</p><p>“Please. I’d be grateful.”</p><p>And I remembered that other photograph from the front pages a few days ago. Fifteen or twenty refugees disembarking at a German rail station and being met with applause from sympathetic citizens; in the photograph, some of the arrivals were smiling, some laughing, and some were just breathing deeply and walking that much taller, it seemed, as if something had at last been restored to them.</p><p>I shook Bernhardt’s hand and said, “Trying to be kind. When I was in Berlin, the police closed a crossroads in the Tiergarten. Then bikes and a motorcade came through. The Austrian head of state. Faymann. For a little summit with Merkel. Hours later, they announced they were sealing the border.”</p><p>“The numbers. The scale.”</p><p>“And the day before yesterday I was in Salzburg and there were no trains to Munich. All cancelled. We came here by car.”</p><p>“Long wait at the border?”</p><p>“Only if you go on the highway. That’s what the driver told us. He took the parallel roads.” I hesitated. “On your train to Munich . . . ”</p><p>I felt the impulse to ask Bernhardt if at any point he had found it necessary to disengage himself from the eight hundred. I didn’t ask, but I could have and should have.</p><p>Bernhardt said, “You know, they won’t stop coming. They pay large sums of money to risk their lives crossing the sea and then they walk across Europe. They <em>walk</em> across Europe. A few policemen and a stretch of barbed wire can’t keep them out. And there are millions more where they came from. This is going to go on for years. And they won’t stop coming.”</p><p>It was one-fifty. I had forty minutes. (My book tour was winding down and this was not a busy day.) In the bar, I waited at the steel counter. When Bernhardt asked me how I<span data-page="page_2"></span> was bearing up after three weeks on the road in Europe, I said I was well enough, though chronically underslept. Which was true. And actually, Bernhardt, to be even more frank with you, I feel unaccountably anxious, anxious almost to the point of formication (which the dictionary defines as “a sensation like insects crawling over the skin”); it comes and goes. . . . Home was four thousand miles away, and six hours behind; pretty soon, it would be quite reasonable, surely, to return yet again to my room and see if there were any fresh bulletins from that quarter. For now, I looked mistrustfully at my phone; in the in-box there were more than eighteen hundred unopened messages, but from wife, from children, as far as I could tell, there was nothing new.</p><p>The heroically methodical bartender duly set his course in my direction. I asked for a beer.</p><p>“Nonalcoholic. D’you have that?”</p><p>“I have one-per-cent alcoholic.”</p><p>We were both needing to shout.</p><p>“One per cent.”</p><p>“Alcohol is everywhere. Even an apple is one-per-cent alcoholic.”</p><p>I shrugged. “Go on, then.”</p><p>The beer the Oktobrists were drinking by the quart was thirteen per cent, or double strength; this, at any rate, was the claim of the young Thomas Wolfe, who, after a couple of steins of it, acquired a broken nose, four scalp wounds, and a cerebral hemorrhage in a frenzied brawl, which he started, in some funfair mud pit—but that was in 1928. These male celebrants in fancy dress at the bar had been drinking since 9 <em class="small">a.m</em>. (I saw and heard them at breakfast), before setting off for the Theresienwiese, if indeed they ever went there. I saw them and heard them the night before, too; at that point they were either gesticulating and yelling in inhumanly loud voices or else staring at the floor in rigid penitence, their eyes clogged and woeful. Then, as now, the barman attended to them all with unconcern, going about his tasks with practiced neutrality.</p><p>I was carrying a book: the forthcoming “Letters to Véra,” by Véra’s husband, Vladimir Nabokov. But the voices around me were unrelaxingly shrill—I could concentrate on what I was reading, just about, but I could extract no pleasure from it. So I took my drink back into the foyer, where the pianist, after a break, had resumed. The businessman was still on the phone; as before, we were sitting two tables apart, and back to back. Occasionally I heard snatches (“Have you got any office <em>method</em> where you are? Have you?”). But now I was slowly and appreciatively turning the pages, listening to that other voice, V.N.’s: humorous, resilient, full of energy. The letters begin in 1923; two years earlier, he sent his mother a short poem, as proof “that my mood is as radiant as ever. If I live to be a hundred, my spirit will still go around in short trousers.”</p><p>When January dawned in 1924, Vladimir (a year older than the century) was in Prague, helping his mother and his two younger sisters settle into their cheap and freezing new apartment. (“Jesus, it’s called basic <em>gumption</em>. Do you know how you spell that?”) These former boyars were now displaced and deracinated—and had “no money at all.” (“5C? <em>No</em>. Obviously. 4C. 4C, for Christ’s sake.”) Vladimir himself, like his future wife, the <em>Judin</em> Véra Slonim, had settled in Berlin, along with almost half a million other Russian fugitives from 1917. And in Berlin the two of them would blithely and stubbornly remain. Their lone child, Dmitri, was born there in 1934. The Nuremberg Laws were passed in September, 1935, and they began to be enforced and expanded after the Berlin Olympics of 1936; but not until 1937 did the Nabokovs hurriedly decamp to France, after a (seemingly never-ending) struggle with visas and exit permits and Nansen passports.</p><p>“I bet you don’t. O.K., here’s an idea. Why don’t you pop on a plane and come and tell them that, here in Germany? With your approach, so-called? They’d laugh you out of town. Because here they happen to understand a thing or two about efficiency. Unlike some. And that’s why they’re the powerhouse of Europe. Because they can handle the ABC and the two times two.”</p><p>I put the book aside and briefly reminisced about Angela (with a hard “g”)—Angela Merkel. I was introduced to her (a handshake and an exchange of hellos) by Tony Blair, in 2007, when she was two years into her first term (and I was spending several weeks on and off in the Prime Minister’s entourage). The top floor of the titanic new Chancellery, the full bar arrayed on the table, the (as yet spotless) ashtrays, Angela’s humorous and particularizing smile. The Chancellery was twelve times the size of the White House—where Blair would also squire me, a week or two later, but I had no more than a sudden moment of eye contact with President Bush, as the two of them emerged from the Situation Room. (This was the time of the Surge in Iraq.)</p><p>Merkel, raised in East Germany in the early days of the Cold War . . . So far, there have been several dozen female heads of state, and I thought then that she was perhaps the first who was capable of ruling <em>as a woman</em>. In the summer months of<span data-page="page_3"></span> 2015, in the world’s eyes she became the brutal auditress of the Greek Republic (and the compromiser of its sovereignty, in the name of fiscal rectitude); by late September, they were calling her <em>Mutti</em> Merkel, as she opened her gates as wide as she could to the multitudes of the dispossessed.</p><p>This is to some extent true of every human community on earth, but the national poet here said of his Germans, with a strain of agony, how impressive they were singly (how balanced, how reflective, how sardonic), and how desperately disappointing they were plurally, in groups, in cadres, in leagues, in blocs. And yet here they all were (for now), the Germans, setting a progressive, even a futuristic example to Europe and to the planet (for now), both as a polity and as a people.</p><p>With the refugee crisis of 2015, Europe, Chancellor Merkel (commonly referred to as “the Decider”) said, was about to face its “historic test.”</p><p>“Will you listen to me? Will you listen to me?”</p><p>But, like a washing machine, the businessman had moved on to a quieter cycle. Still tensed, still crouched, but reduced to a sour mutter. The pianist’s shift was apparently at an end, and I was grimacing into a phone myself, fielding supplementary questions from a studious young profilist I had talked to in Frankfurt. Eavesdroppers and those active in identity theft might have been tempted to draw near, but the foyer continued to be more or less empty.</p><p>“Nineteen-forty-nine,” I said, “in Oxford. Not Wales—that was later. Yes, go ahead. Why did we move to America? Because . . . it sounds complicated, but it’s an ordinary story. In 2010, my mother, Hilary, died. She was eighty-two. My mother-in-law, the mother of my wife, Elena, was also eighty-two at the time. So in response to that we moved to New York.” Yes, and Elena ended a voluntary exile in London which had lasted twenty-seven years, returning to where she was born and bred (Greenwich Village). “Us now? No. Brooklyn. Since 2011. You get too old for Manhattan.” We made our way to the final question. “This trip? Six countries.” And ten cities. “Oh, definitely. And I’m reading all I can find on it, and everyone’s talking about nothing else. Well, I only met literary types, no politicos, no experts. But of course I have impressions.”</p><p>Our call wound up. The businessman was going on in his minatory whisper, “You know who you remind me of? The hordes of ragamuffins who’re piling into this country even as I speak. You, you just can’t stand on your own two feet, can you? You’re helpless.”</p><p>An angular youth from the reception desk approached and handed me a foolscap manila envelope. In it were Bernhardt’s photographs. Registering this, I felt the rhythm of my unease slightly accelerate. I moved next door into the restaurant, and I fanned them out on the table.</p><p>The Europeans you talked to offered different views and prescriptions, but the underfeeling seemed to center on an encounter with something, something not quite unknown but known only at a distance. The entity accumulating at the borders, the entity for which they were bracing and were even rousing themselves to greet with good will and good grace, seemed amorphous, undifferentiated, almost insensate—like a force of nature.</p><p>And it was as if Bernhardt’s camera had set itself the task of individualization, because here was a black-and-white <em>galère</em> of immediately and endearingly recognizable shapes and faces, bantering, yawning, frowning, grinning, scowling, weeping, in postures of exhaustion, stoic dynamism, and, of course, extreme uncertainty and dismay. . . .</p><p>When you glimpsed them in the train stations, they were configured in narrow strings or little knots, always moving, their gaze and gait strictly forward-directed (with no waste of attention, with no attention to spare). But in Salzburg two days earlier I saw seventy or eighty of them lined up on a street corner, very predominantly very young men, in international teen-age gear: baseball caps, luminous windcheaters, dark glasses. Soon they would be approaching the German border (just a few miles away)—and then what? Theirs was a journey with charts and graphs and updates (those cell phones) but with no destination. Dawn had just arrived in Austria, and the buildings shone sheepishly in the wet. And you thought, How will all this look and feel a few weeks from now—after Oktober?</p><p>At four o’clock, as scheduled, I was joined by my penultimate interviewer, an academic, who began by reminding me of a salient historical fact. She was middle-aged, so it was not in her living memory, but it was in the living memory of her mother. In the period from 1945 to ’47, there were ten million homeless supplicants on the periphery of what was once the Reich, all of them deported (in spasms of greater or lesser violence, with at least half a million deaths en route) from Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Romania. And they were all Germans.</p><p>“So your mother remembers that?”</p><p>“Well, she was at the station. She was seven or eight. She remembers the iced-up cattle cars. It was Christmas.”</p><p>I had been gone for seventy-five minutes, and the businessman was still in mid-conversation. By now, his phone had a charger in it, and the short lead, plugged into a ground-level socket, required him to bend even tighter—he was jack-knifed<span data-page="page_4"></span> forward, with his chin an inch from the knee-high tabletop.</p><p>“You carry on like this and you won’t have a roof over your head. You’ll be on the street and you’ll deserve it. The wheels are coming off your whole apple cart. And I’m not surprised. Bloody hell, people like you. You make me sick, you do. Professionally sick.”</p><p>The pianist had gone but other noisemakers were taking up the reins—a factory-size vacuum cleaner, a lorry revving and panting in the forecourt. I went back to my book. August, 1924, and Vladimir was in Czechoslovakia again, holidaying with his mother in Dobřichovice. The hotel was expensive, and they were sharing a (sizable) room divided in two by a white wardrobe. Soon he would return to Berlin, where Véra . . .</p><p>All ambient sounds suddenly ceased, and the businessman was saying, “D’you know who this is? Do you? It’s Geoffrey. Geoffrey Vane. Geoffrey. Geoff. Yeah. You know me. And you know what I’m like. . . . Right, my patience is at an end. Congratulations. Or, as you’d say, <em>super</em>. . . . Now. Get your fucking Mac and turn to your fucking e-mails. Do you understand me? Do you understand me? Go to the communication from the fucking agent. The on-site agent. You know, that fucking Argy—Feron. Fucking Roddy Feron. Got it? Now bring up the fucking attachment. Got it? Right—fucking 4C.”</p><p>The often used intensifier he pronounced like “cooking” or “booking.” At this point, I slowly slid into the chair opposite me, so I could have a proper look at him—the clerical halo of quite thick gray hair, the head, still direly bowed and intent, the laptop, the legal pad.</p><p>“It’s the fucking liability. Do you understand me? Now <em>say</em>. 4C. Does that, or does that not, square with Tulkinghorn’s B6? It does? Well, let’s thank the Lord for small mercies. Now go back to fucking 4C. And fucking O.K. it. O.K.? O.K.” He added, with special menace, “And woe betide you if we have to go through this again. You fucking got that? Sweet dreams. Yeah, <em>cheers</em>.”</p><p>And now, in unwelcome symmetry, the businessman also moved to the seat opposite him, though swiftly and without rising above a crouch; with his meaty right hand he appeared to be mopping himself down, seeing to the pink brow dotted with motes of sweat, the pale and moist upper lip. Our eyes met inexorably, and he focussed.</p><p>“Do you understand English?”</p><p>. . . Do I understand English? “Uh, yeah,” I said.</p><p>“Ah.”</p><p>And I speak it, too. Great Britain no longer had an empire, except the empire of words—not the imperial state, just the imperial tongue. Everyone knew English. The refugees knew English, a little bit. That partly explained why they wanted to get to the U.K. and Eire, because everyone there knew English. And it was why they wanted to get to Germany: the refugees knew no German, but the Germans all knew English—the nut-brown maid who was brushing the curtains knew English, the sandy-haired bellhop knew English.</p><p>“You’re <em>English</em>,” he announced, with reluctant admiration.</p><p>I found myself saying, “London, born and bred.” Not quite true, but this wasn’t the time to expatiate on my babyhood—with the mother who was barely older than I was—in the Home Counties, circa 1950, or to dream out loud about that early decade in South Wales, mostly blissful, when the family was still nuclear. But, for half a century after that, yes, it was London. He said, “I can tell by the way you talk. . . . That was a tough one, that.”</p><p>“The phone call.”</p><p>“The phone call. You know, with some people, they haven’t got a clue, quite honestly. You’ve just got to start from scratch. Every—every time.”</p><p>“I bet.” And I cursorily imagined a youngish middle manager, slumped over his disorderly workstation in a depot or showroom by an airport somewhere, loosening his tie as he pressed the hot phone to his reddened ear.</p><p>“Look at that,” the businessman said, meaning the television—the eternally silent television. On its flat screen, half a dozen uniformed guards were tossing shop sandwiches (cellophane-wrapped) into a caged enclosure, and those within seemed to snap at them—and it was impossible to evade the mental image of feeding time at the zoo. “Amazing,” he said with contented absorption, as he made some calculations on his yellow pad. “Amazing the lengths people’ll go to for a handout, in’t it?”</p><p>The “in’t it?” was rhetorical: this truism anticipated no reply. In Kraków and Warsaw (I recalled, as the business-man immersed himself in his columned figures), everyone was saying that Poland would be exempt: the only homogeneous country in Central Europe, the only monoculture, blue-eyed Poland thought it would be exempt because “the state gives no benefits.” I heard this from a translator so urbane that he could quote at length not only from Tennyson but also from Robert Browning; and in answer I nodded, and resumed work on my heavy meal. But when I was dropped off at the hotel (and stood on the square facing the antique prosthetic leg of Stalin’s Palace of Culture), I slowly shook my head. Someone who has trekked across the Hindu Kush would not be coming to Poland for a diet of shop sandwiches.</p><p>“Where are we? What country’s this?” He meant the country where dark-skinned<span data-page="page_5"></span> travellers were being tumbled and scattered by water cannon (followed up with tear gas and pepper spray).</p><p>I said, “Looks like Hungary.”</p><p>“That bloke there’s got the right idea.” He paused as he closed his eyes and his bloodless lips mimed a stretch of mental arithmetic. “What’s he called?”</p><p>“Orbán.”</p><p>“Yeah. Orbán. We ought to be doing likewise in Calais. It’s the only language they understand.”</p><p>Oh, no, sir, the language they understand is much harsher than that. The language they understand consists of barrel bombs and nerve gas and the scimitars of incandescent theists. That language is what they are fleeing; it speaks to them only of fear and futurelessness. He said, “Merkel. Merkel should take a leaf out of Orbán’s book. Merkel should do an Orbán. Look. See?”</p><p>He meant the footage evidently posted by the Islamic State—a truck exploding in slow motion, three prisoners in orange jumpsuits kneeling on a dune, multipronged fighters tearing by in S.U.V.s.</p><p>“Then there’s <em>that</em>.” He achieved some climactic grand total on his pad, underlined it three times and circled it before tossing the pen aside. “Jihadis.”</p><p>“Might be complicated,” I said.</p><p>“Complicated. . . . Hang about,” he said, with a doubtful frown. “Silly me. Forgot to factor in the twelve per cent. Give us a minute.”</p><p>Perhaps a better name for them, sir, would be <em>takfiris</em>. The <em>takfir</em> accusation (the lethal accusation of unbelief) is almost as old as Islam, but, in current usage, <em>takfiris</em>, Mr. Vane, is sharply derogatory, and it means Muslims who presume to kill Muslims. And these <em>takfiris</em> don’t and won’t mind, Geoffrey, when the Muslims of Europe suffer, because their policy here is the same as Lenin’s during the Russian Civil War: “the worse the better.” Is it fanciful, Geoff, to suggest that this lesson derives from the witches in the Scottish play—“Fair is foul, and foul is fair”?</p><p>“<em>Complicated</em>? That’s the understatement of the year.”</p><p>Suddenly he became aware of the phone he had reflexively reached for. He inhaled with resignation and said, “You know what gets me? The repetitions. You go through the same things again and again. And it just doesn’t sink in. Not with that one, oh, no. Not with her.”</p><p>Her? I sat up straight.</p><p>“Tell me something. Why’re they all coming <em>now</em>? They say despair. Despair, they say. But they can’t all have despaired in the same week. Why’re they all coming at the same time? Tell me that.”</p><p>I regrouped and said, “That’s what I’ve been trying to find out. Apparently, a safe route opened up. Through the Balkans. They’re all in touch with one another and then there it was on Facebook.”</p><p>He went blank or withdrew for a moment, then he returned. “I’ll give them bleeding Facebook. I’ll give them bleeding Balkans. They . . . They’ve turned their own countries into, into hellholes, quite honestly, and now they’re coming here. And even if they don’t start killing us all they’re going to want their own ways, aren’t they? Halal, in’t it. Mosques. Uh, Sharia. Arranged marriages—for ten-year-old cousins. Yeah, well, they’ll have to adapt, and quick about it, too. They’ll have to look sharp and bow their heads and fall into line. Socially. On the women question and that.”</p><p>He closed his computer, and gazed for a moment at its surface.</p><p>“You know, I’ll have to call her back.” And there was now a sudden weak diffidence in his smile as he looked up and said, “It’s my mum.”</p><p>I had to make an effort to dissimulate the scope of my surprise. . . . Shorn of context (the business hotel, the business suit, the expensive orthopedic shoes, like velvet Crocs), his bland round gray-fringed face looked as though it would be happiest, or at least happier, on a village green on a summer afternoon; that face could have belonged to anybody, an alderman, a newsagent, a retired colonel, a vicar. With a nod, I reached for my electronic cigarette and drew on it.</p><p>“Eighty-one, she is.”</p><p>“Ah, well.” After a moment, I said, “My mother-in-law’s eighty-six.” And you see, sir, it’s a long story, but she was the reason we left England; and we never regretted it. The process was entirely natural for Elena, and, as for me, there was filial love left over after the death of Hilary Bardwell, and it had nowhere else to go. “My wife’s mother. Five years older than yours.”</p><p>“Yeah? And what’s the state of her, then, eh? Can she hold a thought in her head for two minutes? Or is she all over the gaff like mine? I mean, when your bonce goes, I ask you, what is the sense of carrying on?”</p><p>I gestured at the instrument he still held in his hand and said, “Just wondering, but what was that—what was that to do with?”</p><p>He sat back and grunted it out: “Lanzarote.” Sinking deeper, he reached up and eased his writhing neck. “For her eightieth, see, I bought her a beautiful little time-share in Lanzarote. Beautiful little holiday home. Maid looking in every morning. Gardener. Good place to park her in the winter. Roof terrace overlooking the bay. And now she’s meant to renew the insurance. That’s all it is. The contents insurance and that. Shouldn’t have taken but a minute.”</p><p>“Well. They do find it hard to . . .”</p><p>“You know,<span data-page="page_6"></span> I’ve got four brothers. All younger. And not one of them’ll touch her with a bargepole. They won’t have anything to do with her. It’s true the old—she does drive you mad, there’s no question. But you’ve got to grind it out, haven’t you? And the four of them, they won’t go near her. Can you credit it? They won’t go near their own fucking mum. Pardon the language. Yeah, well, they haven’t got my resources, admittedly. So answer me this. Where would she be without her firstborn?”</p><p>With a glance at my watch, I said, “Damn. I’d better pack.”</p><p>“Oh. Long journey?”</p><p>“Just the airport. Early tomorrow morning. I thought I’d do it now and try and get a bit more sleep.”</p><p>“Here for a day or three yet, me. Rest up. Look in at the gym. There’s that restaurant I’ve heard about on the corner. Where’re you flying?”</p><p>“Home. Nice talking to you.”</p><p>As I bunched and crushed various items into the splayed bag, I activated my computer. And saw that there was still no message from my wife (nor from a single one of my children). Yes, well, it was the same with Nabokov; he went through it, too. “Don’t you find our correspondence is a little . . . one-sided?” And, in my case, it was curious, because when I was away like this I never fretted about my other life, my usual life, where everything was nearly always immobile, fixed, site-tenacious.</p><p>Otherwise, I felt fine, and even quite vain of my vigor (health, after all, unbroken), and buoyant, and stimulated, and generally happy and proud; the tour had awakened anxiety in me but even the anxiety, I have to say, was not unwelcome, because I recognized it as the kind of anxiety that would ask to be written about. At odd moments, though, I seriously questioned the existence of the house in Brooklyn, with its three female presences (wife, daughters), and I seriously questioned the existence of my two boys and my other daughter, all grown, in London—and my two grandchildren. Could they, could any of them, still be there?</p><p>“Good morning, this is your wakeup call. . . . Good morning, this is your wakeup call. . . . Good morning, this is your—”</p><p>It was early, and I had one final appointment. A radio interview with a journalist called Konrad Purper; it took place in what they called the Centre d’Affaires, with its swivel seats and cord carpets. When it was over, Konrad and I stood talking in the foyer until my chaperone promptly but worriedly appeared. There had been many chaperones, many helpers and minders—Alisz, Agata, Heidi, Marguerite, Ana, Hannah, Sophie.</p><p>“There are no taxis!” Sophie said. “They can’t get near us. Because there’s too many people!”</p><p>Normally I am very far from being an imperturbable transatlantic traveller. But at that moment I sensed that my wristwatch was moving at its workaday pace; time did not start speeding up, did not start heating up. What was the least good thing that could happen? Nothing much. I said, “So what do we do?”</p><p>“Walk.”</p><p>“To the airport.”</p><p>“No—sorry. I’m not clear. To the train station. We can get there from there.”</p><p>“Oh, and the station’s close, isn’t it?”</p><p>“Five minutes,” Konrad said. “And every ten minutes a rail shuttle goes to Munich International.”</p><p>Sophie and I started out, rolling our bags, and with Konrad perhaps coincidentally rolling his bike, and the three of us often rolling aside onto the carless tarmac in deference to the pageant of costumed revelers coming the other way. This narrow thoroughfare, Landwehrstrasse, with its negotiations between West and East—Erotic Studio, Turkish Restaurant, Deutsche Bank, Traditional Thai Massage, Daimler-Benz, Kabul Market. . . .</p><p>We came out into the air and space of the Karlsplatz, where the strong-limbed mannequins stood in lines or streamed by in biblical numbers—many of the women, in the second week, decadently wearing the despised “Barbie” alternative (a thick-stitched bodice and a much shortened dirndl showing the white stocking tops just above the knee). How did it go in the funfair? According to Thomas Wolfe, they had merry-go-rounds, and an insane profusion of sausage shops, and whole oxen turning on spits. They ate and drank in tents that could seat six thousand, seven thousand, eight thousand. If you were in the middle of this, Wolfe wrote, Germany seemed to be “one enormous belly.” Swaying, singing. Germans en masse, objectively ridiculous, and free at last of all irony.</p><p>Sophie, I saw, was talking to a policeman stretched out in a parked sidecar. Konrad stood by. She turned and said to me, “It’s—you can’t even get there by foot!”</p><p>For many years I lived in Notting Hill, and sat through many Carnivals (in earlier times, often attending with my sons); I knew about cordons, police gauntlets, closed roads (for ambulance access), and panics and stampedes. Once, I was in a crush that comprehensively assured me that you could face death because of a superfluity of life. Yes, there were affinities: Carnival was like Oktoberfest, but the flesh there was brown and the flesh here was pink. Hundreds of thousands of high-esprit scoutmasters, hundreds of thousands of festive dairymaids in their Sunday best.</p><p>“The only way is underground. One stop.”</p><p>Soon we were looking into the rosy deep of the<span data-page="page_7"></span> stone staircase. Getting on for a month ago, in Brooklyn, while she was helping me pack, Elena remarked that my family-sized suitcase was “not full enough.” Well, it was certainly heavy enough, by now, with its sediment of gifts (typically chocolates) and reading matter and things such as Bernhardt’s portfolio, in its stiff brown envelope. Humping that big load through the underground—I can do it, I thought, but I won’t like doing it. And yet, once again, Konrad, having tethered his bike, was quietly at our side, dark-haired, stocky, and calm, and my bag was now swinging easily in his grip.</p><p>In the Hauptbahnhof itself, the crowd was diversified by thin streams of dark-skinned and dark-clothed refugees, their eyes haunted and determined, their tread leaden but firm, dragging their prams and goods-laden strollers, their children. Then came a rare sight, and then an even rarer one.</p><p>First, a mother of a certain age, a grandmother, probably, tall, dressed in the rigid black of the full abaya, with her half-veiled face pointed straight ahead. Then, second, a lavishly assimilated young woman with the same coloring, perhaps the granddaughter of a Turkish <em>Gastarbeiter</em>, in tight white jacket and tight white jeans—and she had a stupendously, an unignorably full and prominent backside. For half a minute, the two women inadvertently walked in step, away from us: the glide of the black edifice like a towering wheelie, the hugely billowing orbs of white.</p><p>When he had pointed us to our platform, Konrad took his leave, much thanked, much praised. I turned to Sophie. “The two women—did you see that?”</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>“Well. She’s not embarrassed by it, is she? Looking so cheerful. Swinging her arms. And dressed like that? She’s not trying to hide it.”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“I mean she’s not shy about it.”</p><p>“No,” Sophie said. “She likes it.”</p><p>The Nabokovs were refugees, and three times over. As teen-agers, they independently fled the October Revolution; on her way out, Véra Slonim passed through a pogrom in the Ukraine involving tens of thousands of mob murders. That was in 1919. They fled the Bolsheviks, horsemen of terror and famine, and, via the Crimea, Greece, and England, sought sanctuary—in Berlin. Then France, until the Germans followed them there; then the eleventh-hour embarkation to New York, in 1940, a few weeks ahead of the Wehrmacht. (On its next westbound crossing, their boat, the Champlain, was torpedoed and sunk.) V.N.’s father (also Vladimir Nabokov), the liberal statesman, was murdered by a White Russian fascist in Berlin (1922). In the same city, his brother Sergei was arrested in 1943 (for homosexuality) and rearrested the following year (for seditious talk); he died in a concentration camp near Hamburg, in January, 1945. That was their Europe; and they went back there, in style and for good, in 1959.</p><p>Yes, and I met Véra, too. I spent most of a day with her, in 1983, in the still center of Europe, the Palace Hotel in Montreux, Switzerland (where they had lived since 1961), breaking only for lunch with her son, the incredibly tall Dmitri, whom I would meet again. Véra was a riveting and convivial golden-skinned beauty; on sensitive subjects she could turn dauntingly fierce, but I was never really frightened, because I thought there was always the light of contingent humor in her eyes.</p><p>Vladimir died in 1977, aged seventy-eight. Véra died in 1991, aged eighty-nine. And Dmitri died in 2012, aged seventy-seven.</p><p>He was childless. And now his ashes (marking the closure of this genetic line) are interred with those of his parents, in the cemetery in Montreux.</p><p>I got to Munich International with an extra half hour to spare. And there in the terminal, bathed in watery early-morning light, behind the little rampart of his luggage (a squat gunmetal suitcase, a tan valise with numerous zips and pouches), and leering into his cell phone, stood Geoffrey the businessman. I greeted him and said, “Why are you here? I thought you were going to take it easy for a few days.”</p><p>“Who, me? Me? I should be so blessed. Nah. Her fucking bungalow burnt down last night. Electrics. It’s always electrics. Burnt down to the fucking ground.”</p><p>“Really? She wasn’t in it, was she?”</p><p>“Her? No, snug as a bug in Sheffield, thanks very much. It’s muggins here that has to go to fucking Lanzarote. See if we got any contents insurance. Or any insurance at all.”</p><p>“Will it be hard to get to Lanzarote?”</p><p>His face narrowed shrewdly. “You know what you do when something like this happens? When you’re a bit stranded? You go down under. Under here.” And he soundlessly tapped his padded shoe on the floor. “That’s where the airline <em>offices</em> are. Under here. You go down there and you go around and you sniff out the best deal.”</p><p>“Well, good luck.”</p><p>“Oh, I’ll be all right. It’s only money.”</p><p>So there was time for lots of coffee and for delicious and fattening croissants in the lounge. Then the brand-new, hangar-fresh Lufthansa jumbo jet took off, on schedule. Soon I was gorging myself on fine foods and choice wines, before relishing “Alien” (Ridley Scott) and then the sequel, “Aliens” (James Cameron). I landed punctually. Would-be immigrants and even asylum-seekers often had to wait two years, but after two hours, in the admittedly inhospitable environs of Immigration, I was allowed into America.</p><p>-=-=-=-<span data-page="page_final"></span></p><p>And what I returned to, eerily and almost tremulously, still held, Elena and the daughters—who went far and wide, as they pleased, who boldly roamed Manhattan, where their grandmother (I now heard it confirmed) was still installed in the deluxe sunset home that, very understandably, she kept mistaking for a hotel.</p><p>How solid it all was, this other existence. How advanced, how evolved, with its devices, its machines, which all seemed to work. How tightly joined to the earth it was, with its steel and concrete, the five-story house on Strong Place.</p><p>The anxiety in me was deeply layered and durable, because it went back to before I was born. Coming to terms with this involved work of mind, most of it done in darkness. I was home in America, the immigrant nation, stretching from sea to shining sea, and I couldn’t sleep. “Night is always a giant,” the champion insomniac Nabokov wrote in “Transparent Things,” “but this one was especially terrible.” I had another book on my bedside table, a short, stylish study by the historian Mark Mazower, called “Dark Continent,” and I would sometimes go to the next room with that for an hour, before defeatedly returning.</p><p>When I closed my eyes, I was met by the usual sights—an abstract battlefield or dismantled fairground at dusk, flowers in monochrome, figures cut out of limp white paper. And the thoughts and images verged encouragingly on the nonsensical. But no—my mind was in too low a gear for the cruise control of unconsciousness. . . .</p><p>And so many possible futures were queuing up and jockeying to be born. And, in time, one or other of them would go thundering clear of the rest.</p><p>And they were coming here, the refugees, in the eye of a geohistorical convergence—themselves and their exodus on the one hand, and, on the other, Al Qaeda and Al Shabaab and Boko Haram and the Taliban and Sinai Province and <em class="small">isis</em>.</p><p>And even now it was as if a tectonic force had taken hold of Europe and, using its fingernails, had lifted it up and tilted it, politically, causing a heavy mudslide in the direction of old illusions, old dreams of purity and cruelty.</p><p>And that force would get heavier still, much heavier, immediately and irreversibly, after the first incidence of <em>takfir</em>. And then Europe—that by now famously unrobust confederation—would, in fact, meet its “historic test.”</p><p>And what they might be bringing, the refugees, was insignificant when set against what was already there, in the host nations, the spores and middens of what was already there. . . . “Dark Continent” is not a book about Africa; the rest of Mazower’s title is “Europe’s Twentieth Century.” ♦</p>	Martin Amis	December 7, 2015 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/12/07/oktober	Angela Merkel	Anxiety	Bars	Books	Businessmen	Europe	Unnamed	First	Immigrants
Pumpkin Head	<p>In <span data-page="page_1"></span>late March, there’d been a sleet storm throughout north-central New Jersey. Her husband had died several days before. There was no connection, she knew. But since that time she’d begun to notice at twilight a curious glistening to the air. Often, she found herself in the doorway of her house, or outside, not remembering how she’d got there. For long minutes, she would stare as the colors faded and a glassy light emerged from the sky and from the Scotch pines surrounding the house. It did not seem to her a natural light, and in weak moments she thought, This is the crossing-over time. She watched, not knowing what she might be seeing. She felt aroused, vigilant. She felt apprehension. She wondered if the strange glistening to the air had always been there but in her previous, protected life she hadn’t noticed it.</p><p>This October evening, before the sun had entirely set, a pair of headlights turned in to the driveway, some distance away by the road. She was startled into alertness—at first not sure where she was. Then she remembered: Anton Kruppev was dropping by to see her.</p><p><em>Dropping by</em>, he’d said. Or maybe she’d said, <em>Why don’t you drop by?</em></p><p>She couldn’t make out his face. He was driving a pickup truck with white lettering on one side. He climbed down from the driver’s seat in the high cab and lurched toward her on the shadowy path—a tall male scarecrow figure with a misshapen Halloween pumpkin for a head.</p><p>What a shock! Hadley backed away, not sure what she was seeing. A grinning pumpkin head on a man’s shoulders, its leering cutout eyes not lit from within, like a jack-o’-lantern, but dark, glassy. And the voice issuing through the grinning slash-mouth in heavily accented English: “Ma’am? Is correct address? You are—lady of the house?”</p><p>She laughed, nervously. She supposed she was meant to laugh.</p><p>With grating mock gravity, the voice persevered: “You are—resident here, Ma’am? I am—welcome here? Yes?”</p><p>It was a joke. One of Anton Kruppev’s awkward jokes. He’d succeeded in frightening Hadley, though probably that hadn’t been his intention—probably he’d just meant to make her laugh. It was embarrassing that she’d been genuinely frightened, for she had known perfectly well that Anton was coming. And who else but Anton Kruppev would show up like this, with a Halloween pumpkin for a head?</p><p>At the co-op, Anton was the most eager and courteous of workers. He was the one who joked with customers, and laughed at his own jokes; he was boyish, vulnerable, and touching. His halting speech was itself a kind of laughter, not fully intelligible yet contagious. For all his clumsiness, you could tell that he was an exceptionally intelligent man. Hadley could see that he’d gone to painstaking trouble carving the pumpkin head: it was large, bulbous, weirdly veined and striated, twice the size of a normal man’s head, with triangular eyes, a triangular nose, and a mouth studded with fang-teeth. Somehow, he’d managed to force the thing over his head—Hadley couldn’t quite see how.</p><p>“How ingenious, Anton! Did you carve it yourself?”</p><p>This was the sort of inane question you asked Anton Kruppev. For you had to say something to alleviate the tension of the man’s aggressive-doggy eagerness to please, to impress, to make you laugh. Hadley recalled the first time Anton had come by to see her, which had been the previous week—the strained and protracted conversation between them when, after Hadley had served him coffee and little sandwiches on multigrain bread, Anton hadn’t seemed to know how to depart; his lurching over her, his spasm of a handshake, and his clumsy wet kiss on her cheek which had seemed to sting her, and to thrill her, like the brush of a bat’s wings.</p><p>“Yes, <em>Ma’am</em>. You think—you will <em>buy</em>?”</p><p>“That depends, Anton. How much . . . ”</p><p>“For you, <em>Ma’am</em>, no charge!”</p><p>This forced joke, how long would it be kept up? Hadley wondered in exasperation. In middle school, boys like Anton Kruppev were snubbed—<em>Ha ha, very funny!</em>—but once you were an adult how could you discourage such humor without being rude? Hadley was thirty-nine. Anton couldn’t have been more than twenty-nine. He’d been born in what was now called Bosnia and Herzegovina, had lost his parents, and was brought to the United States by a surviving grandparent. He’d gone to American schools, including M.I.T., and yet in all those years had not become convincingly <em>American</em>.</p><p>Trying too hard, Hadley thought. The sign of the foreign-born.</p><p>In a kind of anxious triumph, sensing his hostess’s exasperation yet determined not to acknowledge it, Anton swung the lurid pumpkin head down from his shoulders, holding it in his chafed-looking, big-knuckled hands. Now Hadley could see that the pumpkin was only two-thirds of a shell. It had been gutted and carved and its back part cut away—the back of what would be, in a human, the cranium. So the uncanny pumpkin head was a kind of pumpkin mask set on Anton’s shoulders and held in place by hand. Yet it was so lifelike; as the scarecrow figure had lurched up the walk in her direction, the face had appeared alive.</p><p>“Is good? Is—surprise? ‘Happy Halloween’ is right?”</p><p>Was it Halloween? Hadley was sure it was not. October 31st wasn’t for several more days.</p><p>“Is for you, Hedley. To set here.”</p><p>He<span data-page="page_2"></span> was red-faced now and smiling in a shyly aggressive manner. On his angular face and in the stiff, wiry hair that receded sharply from his forehead were bits of pumpkin flesh and seeds, at which Anton wiped, surreptitiously, the way a boy might wipe at his runny nose. Hadley thought, If he kisses me, he will smell of pumpkin.</p><p>Her husband had died and abandoned her. Now other men would <em>drop by</em> the house.</p><p>Anton presented Hadley with the misshapen pumpkin. The damned thing must have weighed fifteen pounds. It almost slipped from her hands. Hadley thought it would have served Anton Kruppev right if she’d dropped the pumpkin and it had smashed on the brick. No doubt, he’d have offered to clean it up.</p><p>“Anton, thank you! This is very. . . ”</p><p>Their hands brushed together. Anton was standing close beside her. He was several inches taller than Hadley, though his posture was slouched, his back prematurely rounded. Perhaps there was something wrong with his spine. And he breathed quickly, audibly, as if he’d been running. Or as if he’d been about to declare something and then thought better of it.</p><p>Lanky Anton Kruppev had appeared perhaps a year earlier at the organic-food-and-gardening co-op where Hadley had once shopped regularly—back when she’d prepared elaborate meals for herself and her husband—and now shopped only from time to time. He’d always been alert and attentive to Hadley. Since late March, she’d been in a trance of self-absorption that was like a narcotic to her—in fact, to get through the worst of her insomniac nights Hadley had had to take sleeping pills, which left her dazed and groggy throughout the day—and she’d scarcely been aware of Anton Kruppev except as a helpful and persistent presence, a worker who seemed always to be waiting on her. It was only recently that he’d dared to be more direct, asking if he might come by her house after the co-op closed one evening, to bring her several bags of peat moss that were too heavy and cumbersome for Hadley to remove from the trunk of her car by herself. He’d offered to spread the peat moss wherever she wanted it spread.</p><p>Hadley had hesitated before saying yes. It was true, she was attracted to Anton Kruppev, to a degree. He reminded her of the foreign-born classmates she’d known in middle school, in north Philadelphia; skinny, pasty-faced boys with round eyeglasses and tortured ways of speaking, as if their tongues were malformed. Hadley had been drawn to them, but she’d never befriended them. But now, in weak moments, she was grateful for anyone who was kind to her; since her husband’s premature death, she’d felt eviscerated, worthless. <em>There is not one person to whom you matter now. This is the crossing over</em>. In a sort of hypnotic state, she found herself listening to a voice not her own yet couched in the cadences of her own most intimate speech. This voice did not accuse her, or pass judgment, and yet she knew herself judged, contemptible. <em>Not one person. This is the crossing over</em>. She had signed the paper for her husband’s cremation. In her memory, distorted and blurred by tears, her own name had been printed on the contract, beside her husband’s name. She’d felt that, signing for him, she’d signed for herself as well. It was finished for her—the life of the emotions, the ability to feel.</p><p>Yet with another part of her mind Hadley remained alert, prudent. She was not an adventurous woman, nor was she reckless. She’d been married to one man for nearly twenty years; she was childless and had virtually no family. She had a circle of friends in whom she confided sparingly. Normally, she would never have consented to a stranger <em>dropping by</em> her house, but she’d learned that Anton Kruppev was a postdoc fellow at the prestigious Molecular Biology Institute. He had a Ph.D. from M.I.T. and he’d taught at Caltech; his area of specialization was microbial genetics. She’d once seen him at a string-quartet recital on campus. Another time, she’d seen him walking along the canal towpath, alone. He’d been wearing headphones, and he’d kept his head sharply bowed, working his mouth as if he were arguing with someone. He’d been so lost in concentration that his gaze had drifted over her without seeing her—his favorite co-op customer in a cable-knit sweater, wool slacks, and boots, invisible to him. She’d liked it that Anton Kruppev hadn’t noticed her. That she could observe the young man without his observing her. She’d thought, He’s a scientist. He won’t see anything that isn’t crucial for him to see.</p><p>Now, in her house, Hadley felt a <em>frisson</em> of power over her awkward visitor. She was certain that Anton hadn’t known her husband and wasn’t aware that she was recently widowed. (Hadley still wore her engagement ring and wedding ring, of course.) Her power, she thought, lay in her essential indifference to the man, to his very maleness, his sexuality as clumsy as an odd-sized package he was obliged to carry, to proffer to strangers like her. He had the malnourished look of someone who has been rebuffed many times yet remains determined. There are men of surpassing ugliness with whom women fall in love, but Anton Kruppev was not one of them. His ugliness was not charismatic; his maleness was<span data-page="page_3"></span> of another species altogether. Thinking of this, Hadley felt a swell of elation. <em>If he kisses me tonight, he will smell of—garbage</em>.</p><p>Hadley was smiling. She saw how Anton stared at her, as if her smile were for him.</p><p>She thanked him for the pumpkin yet again. Her voice was warm, welcoming. What an “original” gift it was, and so “cleverly” carved.</p><p>Anton’s face glowed with pleasure. “W-wait, Hedley! There is more.”</p><p>“Hedley,” he called her. At the co-op, it was “Mrs. Schelle,” with an emphasis on the final “e.” Hadley felt no impulse to correct him.</p><p>Anton seized Hadley’s hand—her fingers must have been icy, unresponsive—and pulled her with him out to the driveway. In the rear of the pickup was a large pot of what appeared to be cream-colored chrysanthemums, past their prime, and a long narrow cardboard box of produce: gnarly carrots with foot-long untrimmed greens, misshapen peppers and pears, bruised McIntosh apples that the co-op couldn’t sell, even at reduced prices. And a loaf of multigrain bread that Anton insisted had been baked only that morning but hadn’t sold and so would be labelled “day-old” the next morning. “In this country, there is much ignorant prejudice of ‘day-old.’ Everything has to be ‘new,’ ‘perfect shape.’ It is a mystery to me why to 6 <em class="small">P.M.,</em> when the co-op closes, this bread is good to sell but tomorrow by 8:30 <em class="small">A.M.,</em> when the co-op opens, it is ‘old.’ In the place where we come from, my family and neighbors. . . ” Moral vehemence thickened Anton’s accent; his breath came ever more audible.</p><p>Hadley would have liked to ask Anton more about his background. He’d lived through a nightmare, she knew. Ethnic cleansing. Genocide.</p><p>Yet she felt uneasy in his presence. Very likely, it had been a mistake to allow the eccentric young biologist to drop by her house a second time; she didn’t want to mislead him. She was a widow who had caused her husband to be burnt to ashes and was unrepentant, unpunished. Since March, she’d been declining invitations from friends who had known her and her husband for years. She felt impatient with their solicitude, their concern for her, which she did not deserve. <em>I’m sorry! I don’t want to go out. I’m very tired. I go to bed and can’t sleep and at 1 A.M. I take a sleeping pill. At 4 A.M., I take another. Forget me! I am something that is finished.</em></p><p>She thought now that possibly she didn’t have to invite her visitor into the house, that Anton might not notice her rudeness, might not know enough to interpret it as rudeness. He set the mums and the box with the produce on a white bench near Hadley’s front walk. He’d boasted of being “Mister Fix-It”—and he was quick to see that the terrace behind Hadley’s house contained a number of broken flagstones, which he offered to replace for her. Next he examined the garden gate, which had become warped. He managed to fix it with several deft motions of his hands. “There. It is good as ‘new,’ eh?” he said. He laughed as if he’d said something unexpectedly witty. Hadley was grateful that for all his clumsiness Anton had made no mention of the terrible profusion of weeds amid a lush tangle of black-eyed Susans, Russian sage, and morning-glory vines in Hadley’s husband’s garden, which had been allowed to go wild.</p><p>She was impressed by her visitor’s energy; it brimmed and thrummed like rising yeast. She would have supposed that after a day presumably spent at the lab and several hours at the co-op Anton would be dazed with exhaustion. Yet there he was, tireless in his inspection of the exterior of Hadley’s house—checking windows and locks, dragging aside broken limbs and storm debris. You’d have thought that Anton Kruppev was an old friend of the family for whom the discovery that one of the floodlights on Hadley’s garage had burnt out was something of a coup, inciting him to immediate action. “You have a bulb to replace, yes? And a ladder with ‘steps’—‘stepladder’? I will put in—now—before it is too dark.”</p><p>So adamant that Hadley had no choice but to give in.</p><p>And no choice but to invite Anton Kruppev inside, for just a while.</p><p>Politely and with regret, she explained that she had a dinner engagement later that evening, but would he like to come inside, for a drink?</p><p>“Hedley, yes, thank you! I would like—yes—so much.”</p><p>Stammering with gratitude, Anton scraped his hiking boots against the welcome mat. The soles were muddy and stuck with leaves. Though Hadley insisted that it wasn’t necessary, Anton removed the boots with a grunt and carefully placed them on the front step, side by side. What large boots they were, like a horse’s hooves! The sodden shoelaces trailed out—left, right—in perfect symmetry.</p><p>Inside, most of the downstairs rooms were dark. Now that it was late October, night came quickly. Pleasantly excited, a little nervous, Hadley went about switching on lights. There was a curious intimacy between her and Anton Kruppev, in this matter of switching on lights. Hadley heard her voice warmly uplifted—no idea what she was saying—as her tall guest came to stand in his gray wool socks at the threshold of the living room, which he hadn’t seen previously. He stared into the long,<span data-page="page_4"></span> beautifully furnished room with a shoulder-high stone fireplace at its far end, book-filled shelves, Chinese carpets on a gleaming hardwood floor. Above the fireplace hung an Impressionist Wolf Kahn landscape of gorgeous pastel colors.</p><p>Excitedly, Anton Kruppev asked if the painting was by Cézanne.</p><p>“Cézanne! Hardly.” Hadley laughed, the question was so naïve. Except for the surreal pastel colors and a high degree of abstraction in the rendering of massed tree trunks and foliage, there was little in the canvas to suggest the earlier master.</p><p>Outside, while Anton had been changing the floodlight, Hadley had thought, I will offer him coffee. That’s enough for tonight_._ But now that they were out of the October chill and inside the warm house she offered him a glass of dark-red Catena wine, from a bottle originally purchased by her husband. Anton thanked her profusely—a flush of pleasure rose into his odd, angular face. In his wiry hair that was the color of ditchwater a small pumpkin seed shone.</p><p>Hadley poured herself half a glass of wine. Her hand shook just slightly. She thought, If I don’t offer him a second glass. If I don’t ask him to stay_._</p><p>Since there was an opened jar of Brazil nuts on the sideboard, Hadley offered these to Anton, too. A cascade of nuts into a blue ceramic bowl.</p><p>Gratefully Anton drank, and Anton ate. Thirstily, hungrily. He drifted about Hadley’s living room, peering at her bookshelves. Excitedly he talked—he had so much to say! He reminded Hadley of a chattering bird, a large endearingly gawky bird like an ostrich, long-legged, long-necked, with a beaky face, quick-darting inquisitive eyes.</p><p>His upper body, now that he’d removed his nylon parka, was bony, concave. Hadley imagined that he would be waxy-pale beneath his shirt. A hairless chest. A little potbelly, and spindly legs.</p><p>Hadley laughed. Already she’d almost finished her wine. A warm sensation suffused her throat and spread to the region of her heart.</p><p>Politely she tried to listen—to concentrate—as her eccentric guest babbled rapidly and nervously and with an air of schoolboy enthusiasm.</p><p>How annoying Anton was! Like many shy people, once he began talking he seemed not to know how to stop; he lacked the social sleight of hand to change the subject, and he had no idea how to engage another person. Like a runaway vehicle, he plunged on, heedless. And yet there was something undeniably attractive about him.</p><p>He was becoming more incensed now, impassioned—though he seemed to be joking, too—speaking of American politics, American pop culture, and “American fundamentalist ignorance” about stem-cell research. And, how ignorant! More than ninety per cent of Americans believed in God—and in the Devil.</p><p>Hadley frowned at this. Ninety per cent? Was that so? It didn’t seem plausible that as many people would believe in the Devil as believed in God.</p><p>“Yes, yes! To believe in the Christian God is to believe in His enemy, the Devil. That is known.”</p><p>Anton drained his glass of wine and then helped himself to a second glass, scooping up another handful of the Brazil nuts. Hadley wondered if he meant to be rude, or if he simply didn’t know any better. “I really can’t think,” she persisted, “that as many Americans believe in the Devil as believe in God. I’m sure that isn’t so. Americans are—we are—a tolerant nation.”</p><p>How smug this sounded. Hadley paused, not knowing what she meant to say. The dark wine had gone quickly to her head.</p><p>With a snort of derision, Anton said, “A tolerant nation—is it? Such ‘tolerance’ as swallows up everything and what it cannot it makes of an enemy.”</p><p>“Enemy? What do you mean?”</p><p>“It makes of <em>war</em>. First is declared the <em>enemy</em>, then the <em>war</em>.”</p><p>Anton laughed, baring his teeth. Chunky yellow teeth they were, and the gums pale pink. Seeing how Hadley stared at him, he said, in a voice heavy with sarcasm, “First, there is the ‘tolerance’—then the ‘preëmpt strike.’ ”</p><p>Hadley’s face filled with the heat of indignation. This was insulting, deliberately so. Anton Kruppev, who’d lived in the United States for years, knew very well the history of the Iraq war, how Americans had been misled, deceived by the Republican leadership. Of course he knew. She opened her mouth to protest, then thought better of it.</p><p>Surreptitiously, she glanced at her wristwatch. Only 6:48 <em class="small">P.M.</em>! Her guest had been inside the house for less than half an hour, but the strain of his visit was such that it seemed much longer.</p><p>Still Anton was prowling about, snooping. Artifacts from trips that Hadley and her husband had taken, over the years—Indonesian pottery, Chinese wall scrolls and watercolors, beautifully carved wooden figures from Bali, a wall of brightly colored “primitive” paintings from Mexico, Costa Rica, Guatemala. Anton seemed particularly interested in the books on Hadley’s shelves, as if the hundreds of titles acquired years earlier by Hadley’s husband—who’d earned both a Ph.D. in European history and a law degree from Columbia University—possessed an immediate significance and were not simply relics of a lost and irretrievable private past.</p><p>“You have read all these, Hedley, yes?”</p><p>Hadley laughed, embarrassed. No, she had not.</p><p>“Then—someone else? All these?”</p><p>Hadley laughed again, uncertain. Was Anton Kruppev mocking her? He was peering at her, as at her art objects and bookshelves, with an almost hostile intensity; yet she could not<span data-page="page_5"></span> help it, so American was her nature, so female, that she was still anxious that he like her, and admire her—if she could be sure that he did, then she would send him away in triumph.</p><p>She thought again of the foreign-born youths she’d known in school. In middle school, they had seemed pitiful—objects of sympathy, charity, and condescension, if not derision. In high school, they’d become A students, star athletes. There was a drivenness to them, something that the complacent Americans had initially mistaken for weakness.</p><p>In his soiled wool socks, Anton seemed more childlike than aggressive. Hadley supposed that his own living quarters, in university-owned housing, were minimal, cramped, somewhere in the row of subsidized apartments along the river. “Ah! This is solar room?” He had wandered into the glass-walled room at the rear of the stone house which had been added on by Hadley and her husband; the “solarium,” intended to be sun-warmed, was furnished with white wicker furniture, chintz pillows, and a white wrought-iron table and chairs, like an outdoor porch. But now the room was dark and shadowed, and the bright festive colors were almost invisible. Through the vertical glass panels shone a faint crescent moon, entangled in the tops of the tall pines.</p><p>“Such a beautiful house—it is old, is it?—so big, for one person. You are so very lucky, Hedley. You know this, yes?”</p><p>Lucky! Hadley smiled, confused. She tried to see this.</p><p>“Yes, I think so. I mean—yes.”</p><p>“So many houses in this ‘village,’ as it is called, they are so big. For so few people. On each acre of land, it may be one person—the demographics would show. Yes?”</p><p>Hadley wasn’t sure what Anton Kruppev was saying. A brash sort of merriment shone in his eyes, widened behind the smudged lenses of his wire-rimmed glasses.</p><p>He asked Hadley how long she’d lived in the house, and when she told him that she and her husband had moved there in 1988 he maintained his pained, fixed smile but did not ask about her husband. He must know, then, she thought. Someone at the co-op has told him.</p><p>Bluntly, Anton said, “Yes, it is luck. America is the land of opportunity—all that is deserved is not always granted.”</p><p>“But it wasn’t luck. My husband worked. What we have he earned.”</p><p>“And you, Hedley? You have ‘earned’ also?”</p><p>“I—I—I don’t take anything for granted. Not any longer.”</p><p>Anton peered at her closely. It was as if the biologist were trying to determine the meaning of her words by looking at her. A kind of perverse echolocation—was that the word?—like a bat following a trail of high-pitched beeps. Except that Anton was staring. Hadley saw that the pumpkin seed—unless it was a second seed, or a bit of pumpkin gristle—still glistened in his wiry hair, which looked as if it needed shampooing and would be coarse to the touch. She felt a reckless impulse to pluck the seed out, though she could not risk the intimacy.</p><p><em>He would misunderstand. He is such a fool, he would misinterpret.</em></p><p><em>But if I wanted a lover. A lover for whom I felt no love.</em></p><p>As if Anton had heard these words, his mood suddenly changed. His smile became startled, less strained. He asked Hadley if there were any more repairs for Mister Fix-It, and Hadley said quickly, “No. No more.”</p><p>“Your basement—furnace—that I could check. I am trained. You smile, Hedley, but it is so. To support myself in school—”</p><p>Hadley was sure that she wasn’t smiling. More firmly, she thanked Anton and told him she had to leave soon. “I’m meeting friends for dinner in town.”</p><p>This was clearly a lie. Hadley could lie only flatly, brazenly.</p><p>Anton took a step closer. “I would come back another day, if needed. I would be happy to do this, Hedley. You know this—I am your friend Anton—yes?”</p><p>“No. I mean—yes. Some other time, maybe.”</p><p>Hadley began to lead her guest back out into the living room, into the lighted gallery and the foyer near the front door. He followed in her wake muttering to himself—unless he was talking to Hadley, and meant her to hear, to laugh, for it seemed that Anton was laughing, under his breath. He’d drained his second glass of wine and his movements had become jerky, uncoördinated, like those of a partially animate scarecrow.</p><p>It was then that Anton began to confide in Hadley, in a lowered and agitated voice: the head of his laboratory at the institute had cheated him; he’d taken the discoveries of Anton Kruppev to claim for his own; he’d published a paper in which Anton was cited merely in a list of graduate assistants, and now that Anton had protested he was exiling Anton from the lab. He’d refused to speak to Anton at the institute and had banished him, and so Anton had gone to the university president—he had demanded to be allowed to speak to him, but of course he’d been turned away. Anton had returned the next morning, and when he was again told no he demanded to speak with the provost—and the university attorney. Their offices were near one another in the administration building. But they were all in conspiracy together, with the head of the institute and the head of Anton’s laboratory—he knew this! He was not such a fool, not to know this!<span data-page="page_6"></span> Anton had become excited and someone had called security. The campus police had arrived and led him away protesting; they had threatened to turn him over to the town police, who would arrest him for “trespassing” and “threatening bodily harm.” Anton had been terrified—he would be deported by Homeland Security. He did not yet have his American citizenship—</p><p>“You are smiling, Hedley? What is the joke?”</p><p>Smiling? During this long, breathless, disjointed speech, Hadley had been staring at Anton Kruppev in astonishment.</p><p>“It is amusing to you, yes? That after all my work, my effort—I am most hardworking in the lab—our supervisor exploits my good nature. He was always saying, ‘Anton is the <em>stoic</em> among us’—what this means, this flattery of Americans, is that you can be used. To be <em>used</em>—that is our purpose, to the institute. But you must not indicate that you are <em>in the know.</em>” Anton spoke like someone whose grievances were so far in excess of his ability to express them that he might have been the bearer of an ancient, tribal burden. “And now, after three years, when my findings are cheated from me and I am of no more use, it is time to toss away into the Dumpster. That is good word, good joke, eh? ‘Dumpster’—very good American joke. The institute is saying my contract will not be renewed, for the federal grant is ended. And my supervisor has not ever got around to aiding me with my citizenship application—years it has been. Of course, I have been <em>dialtory</em> myself—I have been working <em>so hard</em> in the lab. Yesterday morning it was, the decision came to me by e-mail. You—you must not smile, Hedley! That is very selfish. That is very selfish and very cruel.”</p><p>The indignant man loomed over Hadley, his angular face hardened with strain. His jaws were clenched. A sweaty-garbagey smell wafted from his heated body. Behind the smudged lenses his eyes were deep-socketed, wary. Hadley said nervously, “Maybe you should leave, Anton. I’m expecting friends. I mean . . . they’re stopping by, to take me with them. To dinner in town . . . ”</p><p>Hadley didn’t want her agitated visitor to sense how frightened she was of him. Her mistake was in turning away to lead him to the door. Insulting him. He looped an arm around her neck, and in an instant they were struggling off balance. He grabbed at her, and kissed her—kissed and bit at her lips, like a suddenly ravenous rodent. Both their wineglasses went flying, clattering to the floor.</p><p>She was trying to draw breath to scream but he’d pushed her down. She thought he was trying to strangle her, then it seemed that he was still kissing her, or trying to. Panicked, she jammed her elbows into his chest, his ribs; his mouth closed over hers and she thought that he would bite off her lip. With a kind of manic elation, he was murmuring what sounded like <em>You like me! You want this!</em> Grunting with effort, he straddled her, his face flushed with emotion; their struggle had become purely physical, and urgent, enacted now in near-silence, except for their panting. Hadley had no idea what she was doing, moving her head from side to side, trying to avoid the man’s mouth, his sharp yellow teeth, the smell of his breath. In a paroxysm of desperation, Hadley managed to squirm out from beneath him, like an animal crawling on hands and knees, and in that instant she almost believed that she might escape Anton Kruppev—but he had only to lunge after her, seize her ankle in his strong fingers, laughing and climbing over her, straddling her again, more forcibly this time, closing his fingers around her neck. In a choked voice, Anton was saying, “You want me here! You asked for this. You have no right to laugh at me. You and your ‘trustee’ husband.” Hadley had no idea what Anton was saying. Trustee? Her husband had served on an advisory board for the history department; he’d had no association with the molecular-biology institute. She could not have explained this; she had not the strength, or the breath, yet she had time to think, almost calmly, This can’t be happening. This is wrong. She seemed to see herself in that instant with a strange stillness and detachment, as she had during her marriage when while she was making love with her husband her mind had slipped free and all that was physical, visceral, and immediate was at a little distance. Though now, tasting the wine on Anton’s tongue, the sour-feral wine taste of a man’s mouth, Hadley knew that she was loathed by the man; his hatred was pure and fiery as she begged him, <em>Please don’t hurt me, Anton. I want to be your friend, Anton. I will help you.</em> It wasn’t wine she was tasting but blood from her upper lip. He disengaged from her roughly and got to his feet, looming over her, his shirt loose, splattered with blood. In a voice of anguish, rage, incoherence, he uttered something that she did not understand, then staggered away to the front door. Then—to her astonishment—he was gone.</p><p>She lay very still, her heart pounding, her body bathed in sweat and the smell of him, her brain blank, oblivious of her surroundings. After several minutes—it may have been as many<span data-page="page_final"></span> as ten or fifteen—she understood that she was alone. It had not quite happened to her the way that she’d believed it would happen, the crossing over.</p><p>She managed to stand. She was dazed, sobbing. She leaned against a chair in the hall, touching the walls, then stumbled to the open doorway and stood, staring outside. The front walk was dimly illuminated by the moon overhead. There was a meagre light, a near-to-fading light. She saw that the pumpkin head had fallen from the step, or had been kicked. It lay shattered on its side. She could see that the innards had been scooped out, but negligently, so that seeds remained, bits of pumpkin gristle. She stepped outside. She wiped at her mouth, which was still bleeding. She would run back into the house and dial 911. She would report an assault. She would summon help. For she required help, badly; she knew that Anton Kruppev would return. Certainly he would return. On the front walk, she stood gazing toward the road—what she could see of the road in the darkness. There were headlights there. An unmoving vehicle. It was very dark, a winter dark had come upon them. She called out, “Hello? Hello? Who is it?” Headlights on the roadway, where his vehicle was parked. ♦</p>	Joyce Carol Oates	January 12, 2009 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/01/12/pumpkin-head	Assaults	Attacks	Foreign Policy	Graduate Students	Halloween	Husbands	Hadley	Third	Immigrants
Second Lives	<p>My <span data-page="page_1"></span>parents, with admirable foresight, had their first child while they were on fellowships in the United States. My mother was in public health, and my father in a library-science program. Having an American baby was, my mother once said, like putting money in the bank. They lived near downtown Baltimore, by the hospital where my mother was studying, in a neighborhood of dilapidated row houses. Baltimore was abject, ugly, my mother said. Cold in winter, a sauna in summer, a violently segregated city, full of fearful whites and angry blacks. America, in those days, had all its dirty laundry available for inspection—the world’s most powerful nation making war with itself in the streets, in universities, in the South, in Vietnam, in the capital just down the road. And yet my parents set about trying to make babies: on spring nights, when they made the room smell of earth, summer nights, when the city felt like a swamp, autumn nights, falling asleep on top of the covers, winter nights, when the room boiled with sex. They were not newlyweds, strictly speaking, but Baltimore reënergized them, made of their pairing something indispensable, something chemical.</p><p>For their efforts, they were rewarded with a son, whom they named Francisco. The district they lived in was one of the poorest in the country at the time, and once the birth was registered my parents were entitled to free baby formula, delivered to their doorstep every Monday morning. They found this astonishing, and later learned that many of the foreign doctors at the hospital were receiving this benefit, too, even a few who didn’t yet have children. It was a gigantic bribe, my father said, the government pleading with its poverty-stricken residents: Please, please don’t riot! Baltimore was adorned with reminders of the last civil disturbance: a burned-out block of storefronts, a boarded-up and untended house whose roof had collapsed after a snowstorm. Every morning, the sidewalks were littered with shattered car windows, tiny bits of glass glinting like diamonds in the limpid sun. No one used money in the neighborhood stores, only coupons; and, in lieu of birds, the skies featured plastic bags held aloft on a breeze. But none of this mattered, because my parents were happy. They were in love and they had a beautiful boy, his photo affixed to a blue First World passport.</p><p>Their American moment didn’t last long. They would have had another child—they would have had me—if their visas hadn’t run out. By the time my mother was done nursing Francisco, a coup had taken place back home, and the military junta that came to power was not entirely friendly with the Johnson Administration. My parents were required to renew their papers every eighteen months, and that year, to their great surprise, they were denied. Appeals, they were told, could be filed only from the home country. The university hospital wrote a letter on my mother’s behalf, but this well-meaning document vanished into some bureaucrat’s file cabinet in suburban Virginia, and it soon became clear that there was nothing to be done. Rather than be deported—how undignified!—my parents left of their own accord.</p><p>And then their gaze turned, back to their families, their friends, the places they had known, and those they had forgotten they knew. They bought a house in a suburb of the capital, where I was raised, an out-of-the-way place that has since been swallowed entirely by the city’s growth. I guess they lost that old Baltimore feeling, because I wasn’t born for another seven years, a crying, red-faced bit of flesh, a runt, undersized even then. No blue passport for me, but they consoled themselves by giving me an Anglo name, Nelson, which was the fashion at the time. Eventually, I got my Third World passport, the color of spilled red wine, but it was just for show. I still haven’t had a chance to use it.</p><p>Francisco, of course, fled at the first opportunity. It was January, 1987, the situation was bleak, and leaving was the most logical thing to do. I was ten years old; the idea was that he’d get me a visa and I’d join him as soon as I finished school. We went as a family to see him off at the airport, took the obligatory photographs in front of the departures board, and waved as he passed through security. He promised to write. He promised to call. He disappeared into the terminal, and then we climbed the stairs to the greasy restaurant above the baggage claim, where we sat by the wall of windows, waiting for a plane that looked like it might be my brother’s to take off. My father drank coffee, fogged his glasses with his breath and polished the lenses between the folds of his dress shirt. My mother drew a palm tree on a paper napkin, frowning. I fell asleep with my head on the table, and when I woke up the janitor was mopping the floor beside us, wondering, perhaps, if we ever intended to leave.</p><p>My brother went to live with the Villanuevas, old friends of my parents from their Baltimore days, who’d settled in Birmingham, Alabama. His first letter was three handwritten pages and began with a description of winter in the Southern United States. That year, the Alabama rains fell almost without pause until the middle of March,<span data-page="page_2"></span> a soggy prelude to an even wetter spring. For Francisco, unaccustomed to this weather, the thunderstorms were impressive. Occasionally, there’d be a downed power line, and sometimes the lights would go out as a result. It was in this familiar darkness, Francisco wrote, that he’d first felt homesick.</p><p>The second half of the letter dealt more specifically with the routines of family life at the Villanuevas. Where they lived wasn’t a neighborhood so much as a collection of houses that happened to face the same street. Kids were permitted to play in the back yard or in the driveway, but never in the front yard. No one could explain why, but it simply wasn’t done. People moved about only in cars; walking was frowned upon, socially acceptable for children, perhaps, if they happened to be accompanied by a dog. The Villanuevas did not have pets. Nor was there anywhere to walk to, really. A two-pump gas station sat about a mile away on Highway 31; its attractions included a pay phone and a magazine rack.</p><p>The Villanueva children, Marisa and Jack, ages fifteen and ten, respectively, made it clear from the outset that they spoke no Spanish. The language didn’t interest them much, and their father, who insisted that my brother call him Julio and not Mr. Villanueva, considered this his greatest failing as a parent. It was his fault, he confessed to Francisco, for marrying an American woman. In general terms, though, things were good. Speaking English with the Villanueva kids, while challenging at first, helped my brother learn the language faster. At school, not a soul spoke Spanish, not even Señora Rickerts, the friendly, well-intentioned Spanish teacher. Francisco was not enrolled with Marisa, as had originally been planned. She went to an expensive private school, which would not permit Francisco to audit classes, so instead the Villanuevas sent him to Berry, the local public high school, with the hicks. This last word, Francisco explained, was the rough English equivalent of <em>campesino</em> or <em>cholo</em>, only it referred to rural white people. He’d learned it from Marisa, and had been advised by Mr. Villanueva never to use it if he wished to make friends. My father found this part of the letter very amusing. How remarkable, he said, that Villanueva’s daughter spoke no Spanish but had somehow imported her father’s classism to North America! How ironic, my father noted, that his own son should learn proletarian solidarity in the belly of the empire!</p><p>My parents read and reread the letter at the dinner table, alternately laughing and falling into worried silence. In the early months, I recall them wondering aloud if they’d made a mistake by sending him away like this. Whose idea had it been? And where was Birmingham, anyway? Was it a city or a town? What kind of school was this place called Berry?</p><p>They wrote back, urging Francisco to send photos. A month passed, and the next letter arrived with a single picture. We saw Francisco with an umbrella and a yellow raincoat, standing next to the mailbox in front of the Villanuevas’ house, a dense knot of purple clouds above. The front yard sloped dramatically, and Francisco stood at an odd slant. He’d put on a little weight—you could see it in his cheeks—and his hair had grown out. His face was changing, my mother said. He was growing up.</p><p>By his third letter, the winter rains had become spring rains, which were the same, only warmer. Storms spread like inkblots across the sky. On sunny days after a rain, the woods behind the Villanuevas’ subdivision looked as if they’d been dipped in light. Everyone said that it was an unusually wet year. Francisco didn’t mind—he was fascinated by the weather. It was everything else that bored him. His great disappointment that spring was that he’d tried out for the Berry High soccer team, and spent three games on the bench, watching the action unfold without him. He’d quit in protest, and, to his surprise, no one had begged him to come back. They hadn’t even noticed. Americans, he wrote, have no understanding of the game. The issue was not mentioned again.</p><p>By the fourth letter, the weather had turned; breezy, pleasant stretches were punctuated now and then by days of blasting heat. School would be over soon. He no longer complained about Berry or his classmates, whose dialect he could barely understand. Instead, he seemed to have settled in. Each week, Francisco went to the Spanish class and led conversation exercises with his American peers, and several of them had sought him out for further instruction. An exchange student from Mexico City had spent time at Berry the previous year, seducing Alabama girls and confounding deeply held stereotypes—he didn’t wear a poncho, for instance, and was apparently sincere in his love of punk music. He’d also left behind a folkloric legacy of curse words: <em>panocha</em>, <em>no manches</em>, and <em>pinche guey</em>. Francisco wrote that he considered it his responsibility to teach these poor gringos to curse with dignity, and this was, as far as he could tell, the only linguistic knowledge they truly thirsted for. He introduced them to important words, words like <em>mierda</em>, <em>culo</em>, and <em>pendejo</em>, while offering the more advanced students a primer on the nearly infinite uses of <em>huevo</em> (<em>huevón</em>, <em>hasta las huevas</em>, <em>hueveo</em>, <em>huevear</em>, <em>se hueveó la huevada</em>). My parents were<span data-page="page_3"></span> proud: “Our son the educator,” they said. Photos included with this letter were of nearby Lake Logan Martin, where the Villanuevas had a weekend house. Sun glinting off the water, bathing suits hanging on a line, barefoot games of Frisbee in the freshly mowed grass. In summer, Francisco might learn to water-ski.</p><p>This was the first letter in which he forgot to ask us how we were.</p><p>That year—the only year he consistently wrote to us—the photos were mostly of Francisco by himself. Occasionally, he’d pose with the Villanuevas: Julio, his wife, Heather, and their two dark-haired, olive-skinned children, who really looked as though they should speak some Spanish. Once, Francisco sent a photo of the Berry High gymnasium, which was notable only for its size. The entire high school, he wrote, would soon be razed and replaced by an even bigger complex farther out in the suburbs. Everyone was excited about this, but he wouldn’t be around to see it. He didn’t intend to stay in Alabama; on this point he was very clear.</p><p>We did eventually get a photo of the few American friends Francisco acquired in those first months, and perhaps this could have clued us in about his eagerness to move on. At home, Francisco had always been part of the popular crowd, the center of a fitful, manic group of friends who loved trouble and music and girls. At Berry, he was on the margins of it all, one of a bunch of skinny outcasts, happy to have found one another in the crowded, cliquish hallways of this immense public school. In these photos: a Korean named Jai, a red-haired boy called Anders, who wore a neck brace, and a frail black kid named Leon, carrying a stack of books and looking utterly lost.</p><p>It was just as well that Francisco didn’t ask us how we were. My parents might not have been able to explain. Or they might not have wanted to. Nineteen eighty-seven was the year of the state-employee strike, which was particularly troubling for us, since my father worked at the National Library and my mother at the Ministry of Health. It started in May, around the time that Francisco was learning to water-ski. There was also dismaying talk of a new currency to replace the one that was soon to be destroyed by rising inflation. Together these horrors would wipe out our already diminished savings. War pressed down on the country in all its fury. Adults spoke of politics as if referring to a long and debilitating illness that no medicine could cure. Presidential elections were on the horizon; no one knew who would win, but none of the options were good. My father was shedding weight and hair at a frightening pace, the stress carving him to pieces.</p><p>Our letters to the U.S. did not include photographs, a small concession to my father’s vanity in those taxing months. Nor did they mention the fact that Francisco was attending the public school because the tuition at Marisa’s school was simply out of the question for us. Or that my parents had already written a letter to Mr. Villanueva postponing the monthly payment for his room and board. Certainly, my parents didn’t tell Francisco how much shame they felt at having to do this. I doubt they even told him that they were afraid they’d lose their jobs, and were speaking with a lawyer about getting citizenship for all of us and coming as a family to join him. These were the issues my parents talked about at home, in front of me (as if I weren’t there) but not with my brother. Why worry the boy? The calls were too expensive to waste time on unpleasant things, and wasn’t he busy enough, learning English and spending his afternoons jumping from the Villanuevas’ pier into the cool, refreshing waters of Lake Logan Martin?</p><p>For most of my childhood, our neighbors across the street were a friendly couple named Alejandro and Luz. They were a little older than my parents, the rare neighborhood couple with no kids, possessing no concept of the kinds of things children might like. They visited from time to time, usually bringing some sort of gift for my brother and me—a jump rope, a pinwheel, that sort of thing.</p><p>Alejandro had big ears and a quirky grin. He wore dark suits and liked to talk politics until late in the evening. He was a good man, my father told me once, and decency was not something to be taken lightly, but when it came to world view—he said this quite sternly—“we simply do not agree with him.” Even now I’m not sure if this meant that Alejandro was a reactionary or a radical. Those were confusing times. Alejandro worked long hours, and months might pass between his visits, whereas Luz often came by to chat with my mother or to play with us. And when both my parents were working late Francisco and I sometimes spent a few hours at her house, deeply involved in card games whose rules the three of us invented as we went along, or listening to the dark, suspenseful stories Luz loved to tell. Ostensibly about her family, these tales of adventure and daring seemed to draw more from Hollywood Westerns, featuring spectacular kidnappings, gambling debts settled with<span data-page="page_4"></span> knife fights, or long, dismal marches through unforgiving mountain terrain. Luz’s manner of speaking made it clear that she had no idea what she might say next. It wasn’t that she made things up, strictly speaking—only that facts were merely a point of departure for her.</p><p>Luz modified whatever game we played, never apologizing, and we rarely minded letting her win, whether at cards or dominoes or hide-and-seek; in fact, it didn’t feel like a concession at all. My brother, who usually kept a studied distance from me and all things preadolescent, regressed in her company, becoming, as if by magic, a gentler, more innocent version of himself.</p><p>Often Luz would let us watch an hour of cartoons while she rested on the couch with an arm draped over her face. We thought she was asleep, exhausted from so much winning, but every time a news break came on Luz would sit up in a flash, cover our eyes, and make us press our hands over our ears. The news in those days was not for children, she always said, and I took her word for it. But afterward, when I had opened my eyes and was blinking hopefully at the television, waiting for the cartoons to come back on, Francisco would say, “Did you see that, little brother? That’s why I’m leaving.”</p><p>Soon after Francisco had gone, Alejandro moved out. It happened almost without anyone realizing it, though the dearth of concrete details was soon overwhelmed by the neighborhood’s combined speculative power: Alejandro had run off with his secretary, with the maid, with the daughter of one of his business associates. The mistress, whoever she might be, was pregnant, or maybe she already had children of her own, whom Alejandro had agreed to take care of. It seemed likely that she was much younger than Luz, that he wanted, after all these years, to be a father. There were a few who thought that his sudden disappearance had more to do with politics, but my father rejected that theory out of hand.</p><p>A few weeks had passed when Alejandro came by late one night. He wanted to speak to my father, alone. They shut themselves in the kitchen with a bottle of pisco, and when they emerged, a few hours later, it was clear that Alejandro had been crying. His eyes were swollen and his arms hung limply by his sides. My mother and I were in the living room. I was supposedly doing homework, but really I was waiting to see what would happen. Nothing did. Alejandro gave us a sheepish nod, while my father stood next to him, pisco bottle in hand. They hadn’t even uncorked it.</p><p>The following day, my mother clarified things a bit. Or tried to. “An affair,” she said, “is when a man takes up with a woman who is not his wife. Do you understand that, Nelson?”</p><p>Sure I did, or at least I thought I did. “And what if a woman takes up with a man who is not her husband?”</p><p>My mother nodded. “That, too.”</p><p>I had other questions as well. “Takes up with”? Something about the way my mother said this phrase alerted me to the fact that it was a metaphor.</p><p>And she sighed, closing her eyes for a moment. She seemed to be thinking rather carefully about what she might say, and I waited, tensely, perhaps even holding my breath. My mother patted me on the head. It was complicated, she said finally, but there was one thing I should be aware of, one thing I should think about and learn now, even if I was too young to understand. Did I want to know? “It has to do with a woman’s pride,” she said, and waited for these puzzling words to take hold. They didn’t. It was all opaque, delightfully mysterious. Alejandro’s affair was different from others, she said. Yes, he had left Luz, and, yes, this was bad enough. Plenty bad. But a woman is proud, and at a certain age this pride is tinged with self-doubt. “We grow old,” my mother told me, “and we suspect we are no longer beautiful.” Alejandro’s new mistress was ten years older than Luz. This was what he’d confessed to my father the night before. A younger woman would have been understandable, expected even, but this—it wasn’t the sort of insult that Luz would easily recover from.</p><p>I knew it was serious by the way my mother’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>“If your father ever does something like this to me, you’d better call the police, because someone’s going to get hurt. Do you understand?”</p><p>I told her I did, and her face eased into a smile.</p><p>“O.K., then, go on,” my mother said. “Go play or something.”</p><p>In those days after Francisco left, “go play” came to mean something very specific: go sit in your room and draw and create stories. I could spend hours this way, and often did. My scripts were elaborate, mostly nonviolent revenge fantasies, in which I (or the character I played) would end up in the unlikely position of having to spare the life of a kid who had routinely bullied me. The bully’s gratitude was colored with shame, naturally, and my (character’s) mercy was devastating to the bully’s self-image. I returned to this theme time and again, never tiring of it, deriving<span data-page="page_5"></span> great pleasure from the construction of these improbable reversals.</p><p>With my brother gone, the room we had shared seemed larger, more spacious and luxurious than before. I’d lived my entire life there, deferring without complaint to my brother’s wishes on all matters of decoration, layout, music, and lighting. He’d made it clear that I was a squatter in his room, an assertion I’d never thought to question. Just before he left, he’d warned me with bared teeth, frightening as only older brothers can be, not to touch a thing. In case he came back. If I were to change anything, Francisco said, he’d know.</p><p>“How?” I asked. “How will you know?”</p><p>He threw an arm around me then, flexing it tight around my neck with the kind of casual brutality he often directed at me. I felt my face turning red; I was helpless. At ten and eighteen, we were essentially two different species. I wouldn’t see him again until we were both adults, fully grown men capable of real violence. I suppose if I’d known this, I might have tried to appreciate the moment, but instead I remained defiant, gasping for breath and managing to ask one more time, “Yeah, but how will you know?”</p><p>Francisco, or versions of him, appeared in many of my early works.</p><p>I took note of what my mother had said about a woman’s pride, and when I was alone with my father I decided to ask him about it. I wasn’t sure if I’d got the full nuance, but I relayed the conversation with my mother as well as I could, concluding with the last bit about the police.</p><p>“She said that?” he asked.</p><p>I nodded, and my father, instead of shedding any light on the situation, just laughed. It was a hearty, surprising laugh, with tears pressing from the corners of his eyes.</p><p>“What?” I asked. “What did I say?” But he wouldn’t answer me, and, finally, when he’d regained his composure, he gave me a big hug.</p><p>“Your mother is a dangerous woman,” he said, and I knew enough to understand that when he said “dangerous” he meant it as a compliment.</p><p>Meanwhile, Luz drew her curtains and rarely left the house. Alejandro never came back.</p><p>A few months later, we learned that Luz was planning to travel to the United States, to visit a cousin of hers in Florida. This was in June, when the strike was under way, and my parents were beginning to feel the stress most acutely. We’d seen little of Luz in the weeks since Alejandro’s visit, but she was often mentioned, always in the same pitying tone. Inevitably, the conversation veered back to my mother’s comment about the police, and my father would tease her about it, until they laughed together. I’d chuckle, too, so as not to be left out.</p><p>Luz’s trip couldn’t have been more perfectly timed. It was scheduled for July, three or four weeks before Francisco’s birthday, the first he would be spending abroad. My mother wanted to send Francisco a gift, just a token, so that he’d know we were thinking of him. After some deliberation, she bought him a dark-blue necktie embroidered with the logo of the National Library. My father approved, said it would help him get a good job. It was a joke, really; we knew that Francisco wasn’t interested in the sort of job where he might need a necktie. The three of us signed a card; separately, my father wrote a long letter, and the whole thing was wrapped and sealed and ready to go. Naturally, there was no talk of trusting our local postal service for this, or for anything, really. We would ask Luz to take it for us and drop it in an American mailbox. Perhaps, my mother said, Luz could even hand-deliver it, should her itinerary include a jaunt through Alabama, and, upon her return, report back—tell us how she’d found Francisco, what she thought of his prospects in the U.S.</p><p>One Sunday afternoon, my mother and I crossed the street and knocked on Luz’s door. She seemed surprised to see us, a little embarrassed, but beckoned us into the house all the same. Immediately, we encountered a problem: there wasn’t anywhere to sit. Sometime in the previous months, much of the furniture had been moved out, and the rooms, half empty now, seemed lonely and sad. Of the chairs that remained, no two faced each other. We strolled through to the living room, where a small television set rested awkwardly on a wooden chair. Luz was thinner than I remembered her, subdued; she seemed to have staggered recklessly toward old age, as if trying to make up in a matter of weeks the ten years that separated her from Alejandro’s new lover. Her hair had faded to a stringy yellowing gray—she’d stopped dyeing it, my mother explained later—and her skin had taken on a similarly unhealthy pallor. Her eyes, even in the dim light, were glassy and unfocussed. Luz asked me to put the television on the floor.</p><p>“Where?” I asked.</p><p>“Oh, Nelson,” she said. “Anywhere.”</p><p>I placed it next to the chair, and Luz indicated that I should sit on it. I looked at my mother for reassurance. She nodded, and so the three of us sat, forming a not quite intimate circle.</p><p>Luz<span data-page="page_6"></span> and my mother went through the protocols of a civilized visit: inoffensive questions, anodyne chitchat, the usual phrases and gestures intended to fill up space rather than convey meaning. It occurred to me as I listened that my mother and Luz were not close. They spoke without much fluency about a minor universe of events that affected neither of them: the vagaries of neighborhood life, people they both knew but didn’t much care about. My mother seemed determined not to speak of our family, of my father, my brother, or even me. It was excessive decorum, as if the very mention of family might be insulting to our grieving hostess. The strain to keep the words coming was noticeable, and I wondered how long it would be necessary to maintain this charade before coming to the point of the visit, Francisco’s gift. Ten minutes? Twenty? An entire hour?</p><p>Luz, as she spoke, as she listened, scanned the room as if looking for someone who was not there. The easy assumption would have been that the someone was Alejandro, but I understood instinctively that this wasn’t the case. There were many people in the room with us, it seemed, a wide variety of people my mother and I could not see: principally, the players in Luz’s life, those who’d known her at various stages of childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, at moments of joy, of whimsy, of expectation. Of anxiety and fear. It seemed to me that Luz was wondering, How did I get to this place? How did this happen? Or perhaps, What are all these people doing in my house, and what must they think of me now? And it was all she could do not to ask these questions aloud. She was gritting her teeth, forcing her way through a conversation with my mother, an artificial exchange about nothing at all, hoping soon to return to her more important, unfinished dialogue with this other, floating gallery of observers. This was my theory, of course. Luz’s eyes drifted to the near distance, to the seemingly empty space just behind us and around us. To the window, to the floor, to the ceiling.</p><p>At a certain point, my mother took Francisco’s festively wrapped package from her purse. She passed it to Luz, who accepted it without saying much. I’d lost track of the words being exchanged, was focussing instead on the minute shifts in Luz’s facial expressions: a sharpening of the creases at the edges of her mouth, or her eyes fluttering closed. My mother explained that the gift was for Francisco, that it was his birthday, that we hated to ask the favor but we hoped it wouldn’t be a problem. Could she take it with her?</p><p>Luz sat, shoulders slouched, neck curling downward. The gift was in her lap, and by the tired look in her eyes you might have thought that it weighed a great deal.</p><p>I’m not sure how I knew, but I did: she was going to say no.</p><p>“What is it?” Luz said.</p><p>My mother smiled innocently; she didn’t yet understand what was happening.</p><p>“A necktie.”</p><p>Luz’s eyes were wandering again, following a dust mote, or the disappearing image of an old friend. She was ashamed to be seen this way, and she was going to take it out on us.</p><p>“Are you well?” Luz asked.</p><p>“We are,” my mother said. “We miss Francisco, of course, but we’re well.”</p><p>“And the strike?”</p><p>At the mention of it, my mother’s expression darkened. She and my father were walking the picket line five days a week, exhausting in and of itself, and, of course, there was the constant threat of violence, from the police, from the more radical elements within their own syndicate. My parents talked about it every night, oblique references at the dinner table, and later, as I fell asleep, I heard the worried hum of voices drifting from their bedroom.</p><p>“We’re getting by,” my mother answered. “God willing, it’ll be over soon.”</p><p>Luz nodded, and reached over to the coffee table. She pulled open a drawer and took out a letter opener. We watched, not knowing exactly what she was after, but she spoke the whole time, carrying on a sort of conversation with herself, a monologue about the declining state of morals in the nation, about a new, aimless generation, and its startling lack of respect for the rules of society as they’d been handed down since the time when we were a colony of the Spanish Empire. A colony? The Empire? I looked toward my mother for help, but she was no less confused than me. There was sadness in Luz’s tone, a defeated breathiness, as if the words themselves were part of a whispered prayer or lament she would’ve preferred not to share with us. At the same time, her hands moved with an efficiency completely at odds with her speech: she held the package now, and, without pausing in her discourse, used the letter opener to cut the red bow my mother had tied. It fell unceremoniously to the dusty floor.</p><p>“Oh!” my mother said.</p><p>It was as if Luz had cut her.</p><p>Then, with the edge of the opener, she peeled back the clear tape my mother had stuck to the wrapping. The paper slipped to the floor, landing at Luz’s feet. She pushed it away with the edge<span data-page="page_7"></span> of her shoe. Her hands kept moving.</p><p>“People these days can’t be trusted. So much has changed from when I was a girl. We knew our neighbors—our town was small. When a boy came around, my father would ask who his parents were, and this was all he and my mother needed to know. If they didn’t approve of his lineage, they’d send the servant out to have a talk with him. To shoo him away, you understand. I watched everything from my window. I was very pretty then.”</p><p>“I’m sure you were,” my mother said, her voice breaking, unable to hide the concern she felt for Francisco’s gift. The box was open now, the white tissue paper was out, ripped in places, and the tie dangled from Luz’s knee, its tip just grazing the floor. Luz opened the card we’d all signed, and spread my father’s letter on her lap, squinting at the handwriting as if decoding a secret message.</p><p>“Is there something wrong?” my mother asked.</p><p>Luz didn’t answer. Instead, she held the necktie up with one hand, and ran her thumb and forefinger carefully along the seam, lightly palpating the length of the fabric. She’d already checked the box and its lining. What was she looking for?</p><p>My mother watched in horror. “What are you doing? Is there a problem?”</p><p>“Where are your people from?” Luz asked.</p><p>“I’m sorry?”</p><p>“The north, the south, the center? The mountains, the jungle? How well do we know each other, really, Monica? Do I know what you do? What your family does? What about that union you belong to, the one making trouble downtown? Did you expect me to get on a flight to America with a package I hadn’t bothered to check? What if there were drugs inside? What if there was <em>cocaine</em>?”</p><p>My mother was stunned. Absolutely immobilized.</p><p>“Am I supposed to rot in an American prison because your impoverished family is willing to gamble with my life?”</p><p>Luz’s eyes were open wide, and she held them that way, staring at us.</p><p>My mother stood abruptly, snatching the necktie and my father’s letter from Luz’s hands. I ducked to grab the box, the wrapping paper, and the bow, but my mother took me by the arm. Her face was a bright and unnatural shade of red.</p><p>“Leave it.”</p><p>Luz reverted now, drawn back into that lonely place she’d been trapped in for months. “Did I say something wrong?” she asked, but the question wasn’t addressed to us.</p><p>The empty rooms were a blur as we raced toward the street. On our way out, I managed to kick over a chair, and I knew by my mother’s expression that she didn’t mind at all.</p><p>The day passed and my mother was in a foul, toxic mood. The neighborhood, always so eager to gossip, was now gossiping about us. We’d tried to send contraband to America, people were saying. Drugs. Tried to take advantage of an unsuspecting elderly woman with a broken heart.</p><p>These were the kinds of humiliations we put up with for Francisco’s sake. There were others. Francisco left Birmingham that October, and only later did we find out why: one afternoon Marisa skipped her S.A.T. prep class, and Mrs. Villanueva came home early to find them groping in the downstairs television room. For me, the most astonishing aspect of the story was undoubtedly the idea that the Villanuevas had a downstairs television room. The rest of the anecdote—even the titillating hint of sex—hardly registered next to this remarkable detail. Mrs. Villanueva gave my brother an hour to pack his things. By the time her husband got home, Francisco had already been dropped off at his friend Jai’s house, forever banished from the Villanuevas’ ordered American lives.</p><p>For months after he’d moved on, we continued to wire money to the Villanuevas to pay off our debt. My father sent several long letters to his old friend Julio, apologizing for his son’s behavior, but these went unanswered, and, eventually, he gave up trying to make things right. The friendship was never repaired, of course, but, then, how could it be? The two men had met in the nineteen-seventies and had seen each other only twice in the intervening years. The mutual affection they felt was an almost entirely theoretical construct, based on memories of long-ago shared experiences—not unlike what I felt toward my brother by then, I suppose. Part fading recollections, part faith.</p><p>Francisco never got around to applying to college, as my parents had hoped he would. He moved briefly to Knoxville, where his friend Leon had enrolled at the University of Tennessee. But soon after that we got a letter from St. Louis (along with a photo of the Arch), and then one from Kansas City (with a picture taken in the parking lot of a rustic barbecue joint). Francisco’s constant movement made it difficult for my parents to get their citizenship paperwork going, though at some point, I imagine, they must have told him what their plan was and how desperate our situation was becoming. Maybe he didn’t understand. Or maybe it was inconvenient for him to think about. Maybe what he wanted most of all was to forget where he’d come from, to leave those troubles and stunted dreams behind and become what his passport had always said he was: an American.</p><p>People talk<span data-page="page_8"></span> a lot these days about virtual reality, second lives, digital avatars. It’s a concept I’m fully conversant with, of course. Even with no technical expertise or much interest in computers, I understand it all perfectly; if not the engineering, then the emotional content behind these so-called advances seems absolutely intuitive to me. I’ll say it plainly: I spent my adolescence preparing for and eventually giving myself over to an imagined life. While my parents waited in line at the American Embassy, learning all the relevant statutes and regulations to insure my passage, I placed myself beside my brother in each of his pictures. I followed him on his journey across America, trying always to forget where I really was.</p><p>He repaired bicycles in suburban Detroit; worked as a greeter at a Wal-Mart in Dubuque, Iowa; moved furniture in Galveston, Texas; mowed lawns at a golf course outside Santa Fe. At home, I read Kerouac and Faulkner, listened to Michael Jackson and the Beastie Boys, studied curious American customs like Halloween, Thanksgiving, and the Super Bowl. I formulated opinions on America’s multiple national dilemmas, which seemed thrillingly, beautifully frivolous: gays in the military, a President in trouble for a blow job.</p><p>My brother turned twenty-one in Reno, Nevada, gambling away a meagre paycheck he’d earned busing tables at a chain Italian restaurant. It could be said that he was happy. This was 1990. He was going by Frank now, and had shed whatever Southern accent he might have picked up in those first few months as a putative member of the Villanueva household.</p><p>Six months passed, and we learned that he had abandoned water-skiing for snow skiing; he was working at a ski resort in the Rockies, and sent photos, panoramic shots of the light mirroring brilliantly off the white snowpack. It was intriguing and absolutely foreign territory. He spent a page describing the snow—dry snow, wet snow, artificial snow, powder—and I learned that people can get sunburned in winter from all the reflected light. I never would have guessed this to be true, though in hindsight it seemed fairly obvious, and this alone was enough to depress me. What else was obvious to everyone but me? What other lessons, I wondered, was I being deprived of even now?</p><p>In school, my favorite subject was geography. Not just mine, it should be said. I doubt any generation of young people has ever looked at a world map with such a powerful mixture of longing and anxiety; we were like inmates being tempted with potential escape routes. Even our teacher must have felt it: when he took the map from the supply closet and tacked it to the blackboard, there was an audible sigh from the class. We were mesmerized by the possibilities; we assumed every country was more prosperous than ours, safer than ours, and at this scale they all seemed tantalizingly near. The atlas was passed around like pornography, and if you had the chance to sit alone with it for a few moments you counted yourself lucky. When confronted with a map of the United States, in my mind I placed dots across the continent, points to mark where my brother had lived and the various towns he’d passed through on his way to other places.</p><p>Of course, I wasn’t the only one with family abroad; these were the days when everyone was trying to leave. Our older brothers applied for scholarships in fields they didn’t even like, just for the chance to overstay their visas in cold and isolated northern cities. Our sisters were married off to tourists or were shipped to Europe to work as nannies. We were a nation busy inventing French great-grandparents, falsifying Spanish paperwork, bribing notaries for counterfeit birth certificates from Slavic countries that were hardly better off than we were. Genealogies were examined in great detail—was there an ancestor to exploit, anyone with an odd, foreign-sounding last name? A Nazi war criminal in your family’s dark past? What luck! Pack your bags, kids—we’re going to Germany! This was simply the spirit of the times. The Japanese kids headed back to Tokyo, the Jewish kids to Israel. A senile Portuguese shut-in who hadn’t spoken a coherent sentence in fifteen years was dusted off and taken to petition the Embassy; suddenly all his grandchildren were moving to Lisbon.</p><p>The state-employee strike didn’t last forever. It ended, as everything did in those days, with an uneasy and temporary resolution: across-the-board pay cuts but no immediate layoffs, a surfeit of mistrust and rancor on all sides. My father was there at the climactic march, when a bank in the old center was burned by government infiltrators and dozens of protesters were beaten and jailed. He was gassed and shot at with rubber bullets, and he, like tens of thousands of others, fled the violence like a madman, running at full speed through the chaotic streets of the capital, a wet rag tied across his nose and mouth. It was, he told me later, the moment he realized he wasn’t young anymore.</p><p>The dreaded election came and went; the crisis deepened. The new President privatized everything, selling the state off piece by piece and dividing the profits among his friends. The truce that had been reached at the end of the strike was broken, and the next year thousands of workers, including my mother, were suddenly laid<span data-page="page_final"></span> off. She was unemployed for months. Prices shot up, the currency crashed, the violence spread, and our world became very small and very precarious. We waited in breadlines, carrying impossibly large stacks of banknotes, which had become a requirement for even the tiniest transaction. People spoke less; strangers distrusted one another. The streets, even during morning rush, had a perverse emptiness to them. We listened to the radio in the dark and emerged each morning fearful to discover what tragedy had befallen us in the night.</p><p>These emotions are quite beside the point now, like an artifact looted from an ancient grave, an oddly shaped tool whose utility no one can quite decipher. But back then, walking through the gray, shuddering city, I thought about my brother all the time. I was ten, I was eleven, unfree but hopeful; I was thirteen, I was fourteen, and my brother had escaped. Fifteen, sixteen: waiting for something to happen, reading obsessively about a place I would never see for myself, in a language I would never actually need. Twenty, twenty-one: small failures, each humiliation a revelation, further proof that my real life was elsewhere. Twenty-five, twenty-six: a dawning awareness that my condition as a citizen of the Third World was terminal.</p><p>And Francisco lived through none of this. As punishment, I set about trying to forget him: the sound of his laughter, his height relative to mine, the content of the conversations we’d had after the lights went out but before we fell asleep.</p><p>I never managed it, of course. ♦</p>	Daniel Alarcón	August 16, 2010 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/08/16/second-lives-2	Alabama	Baltimore	Birmingham	Brothers	Cocaine	Drugs	Unnamed	First	Immigrants
Symbols and Signs	<p>For <span data-page="page_1"></span>the fourth time in as many years, they were confronted with the problem of what birthday present to take to a young man who was incurably deranged in his mind. Desires he had none. Man-made objects were to him either hives of evil, vibrant with a malignant activity that he alone could perceive, or gross comforts for which no use could be found in his abstract world. After eliminating a number of articles that might offend him or frighten him (anything in the gadget line, for instance, was taboo), his parents chose a dainty and innocent trifle—a basket with ten different fruit jellies in ten little jars.</p><p>At the time of his birth, they had already been married for a long time; a score of years had elapsed, and now they were quite old. Her drab gray hair was pinned up carelessly. She wore cheap black dresses. Unlike other women of her age (such as Mrs. Sol, their next-door neighbor, whose face was all pink and mauve with paint and whose hat was a cluster of brookside flowers), she presented a naked white countenance to the faultfinding light of spring. Her husband, who in the old country had been a fairly successful businessman, was now, in New York, wholly dependent on his brother Isaac, a real American of almost forty years’ standing. They seldom saw Isaac and had nicknamed him the Prince.</p><p>That Friday, their son’s birthday, everything went wrong. The subway train lost its life current between two stations and for a quarter of an hour they could hear nothing but the dutiful beating of their hearts and the rustling of newspapers. The bus they had to take next was late and kept them waiting a long time on a street corner, and when it did come, it was crammed with garrulous high-school children. It began to rain as they walked up the brown path leading to the sanitarium. There they waited again, and instead of their boy, shuffling into the room, as he usually did (his poor face sullen, confused, ill-shaven, and blotched with acne), a nurse they knew and did not care for appeared at last and brightly explained that he had again attempted to take his life. He was all right, she said, but a visit from his parents might disturb him. The place was so miserably understaffed, and things got mislaid or mixed up so easily, that they decided not to leave their present in the office but to bring it to him next time they came.</p><p>Outside the building, she waited for her husband to open his umbrella and then took his arm. He kept clearing his throat, as he always did when he was upset. They reached the bus-stop shelter on the other side of the street and he closed his umbrella. A few feet away, under a swaying and dripping tree, a tiny unfledged bird was helplessly twitching in a puddle.</p><p>During the long ride to the subway station, she and her husband did not exchange a word, and every time she glanced at his old hands, clasped and twitching upon the handle of his umbrella, and saw their swollen veins and brown-spotted skin, she felt the mounting pressure of tears. As she looked around, trying to hook her mind onto something, it gave her a kind of soft shock, a mixture of compassion and wonder, to notice that one of the passengers—a girl with dark hair and grubby red toenails—was weeping on the shoulder of an older woman. Whom did that woman resemble? She resembled Rebecca Borisovna, whose daughter had married one of the Soloveichiks—in Minsk, years ago.</p><p>The last time the boy had tried to do it, his method had been, in the doctor’s words, a masterpiece of inventiveness; he would have succeeded had not an envious fellow-patient thought he was learning to fly and stopped him just in time. What he had really wanted to do was to tear a hole in his world and escape.</p><p>The system of his delusions had been the subject of an elaborate paper in a scientific monthly, which the doctor at the sanitarium had given to them to read. But long before that, she and her husband had puzzled it out for themselves. “Referential mania,” the article had called it. In these very rare cases, the patient imagines that everything happening around him is a veiled reference to his personality and existence. He excludes real people from the conspiracy, because he considers himself to be so much more intelligent than other men. Phenomenal nature shadows him wherever he goes. Clouds in the staring sky transmit to each other, by means of slow signs, incredibly detailed information regarding him. His in- most thoughts are discussed at nightfall, in manual alphabet, by darkly gesticulating trees. Pebbles or stains or sun flecks form patterns representing, in some awful way, messages that he must intercept. Everything is a cipher and of everything he is the theme. All around him, there are spies. Some of them are detached observers, like glass surfaces and still pools; others, such as coats in store windows, are prejudiced witnesses, lynchers at heart; others, again (running water, storms), are hysterical to the point of insanity, have a distorted opinion of him, and grotesquely misinterpret his actions. He must be always on his guard and devote every minute and module of life<span data-page="page_2"></span> to the decoding of the undulation of things. The very air he exhales is indexed and filed away. If only the interest he provokes were limited to his immediate surroundings, but, alas, it is not! With distance, the torrents of wild scandal increase in volume and volubility. The silhouettes of his blood corpuscles, magnified a million times, flit over vast plains; and still farther away, great mountains of unbearable solidity and height sum up, in terms of granite and groaning firs, the ultimate truth of his being.</p><p>When they emerged from the thunder and foul air of the subway, the last dregs of the day were mixed with the street lights. She wanted to buy some fish for supper, so she handed him the basket of jelly jars, telling him to go home. Accordingly, he returned to their tenement house, walked up to the third landing, and then remembered he had given her his keys earlier in the day.</p><p>In silence he sat down on the steps and in silence rose when, some ten minutes later, she came trudging heavily up the stairs, smiling wanly and shaking her head in deprecation of her silliness. They entered their two-room flat and he at once went to the mirror. Straining the corners of his mouth apart by means of his thumbs, with a horrible, mask-like grimace, he removed his new, hopelessly uncomfortable dental plate. He read his Russian-language newspaper while she laid the table. Still reading, he ate the pale victuals that needed no teeth. She knew his moods and was also silent.</p><p>When he had gone to bed, she remained in the living room with her pack of soiled playing cards and her old photograph albums. Across the narrow courtyard, where the rain tinkled in the dark against some ash cans, windows were blandly alight, and in one of them a black-trousered man, with his hands clasped under his head and his elbows raised, could he seen lying supine on an untidy bed. She pulled the blind down and examined the photographs. As a baby, he looked more surprised than most babies. A photograph of a German maid they had had in Leipzig and her fat-faced fiancé fell out of a fold of the album. She turned the pages of the book: Minsk, the Revolution, Leipzig, Berlin, Leipzig again, a slanting house front, badly out of focus. Here was the boy when he was four years old, in a park, shyly, with puckered forehead, looking away from an eager squirrel, as he would have from any other stranger. Here was Aunt Rosa, a fussy, angular, wild-eyed old lady, who had lived in a tremulous world of bad news, bankruptcies, train accidents, and cancerous growths until the Germans put her to death, together with all the people she had worried about. The boy, aged six—that was when he drew wonderful birds with human hands and feet, and suffered from insomnia like a grown-up man. His cousin, now a famous chess player. The boy again, aged about eight, already hard to understand, afraid of the wallpaper in the passage, afraid of a certain picture in a book, which merely showed an idyllic landscape with rocks on a hillside and an old cart wheel hanging from the one branch of a leafless tree. Here he was at ten—the year they left Europe. She remembered the shame, the pity, the humiliating difficulties of the journey, and the ugly, vicious, backward children he was with in the special school where he had been placed after they arrived in America. And then came a time in his life, coinciding with a long convalescence after pneumonia, when those little phobias of his, which his parents had stubbornly regarded as the eccentricities of a prodigiously gifted child, hardened, as it were, into a dense tangle of logically interacting illusions, making them totally inaccessible to normal minds.</p><p>All this, and much more, she had accepted, for, after all, living does mean accepting the loss of one joy after another, not even joys in her case, mere possibilities of improvement. She thought of the recurrent waves of pain that for some reason or other she and her husband had had to endure; of the in visible giants hurting her boy in some unimaginable fashion; of the incalculable amount of tenderness contained in the world; of the fate of this tenderness, which is either crushed or wasted, or transformed into madness; of neglected children humming to themselves in unswept corners; of beautiful weeds that cannot hide from the farmer.</p><p>It was nearly midnight when, from the living room, she heard her husband moan, and presently he staggered in, wearing over his nightgown the old overcoat with the astrakhan collar that he much preferred to his nice blue bathrobe.</p><p>“I can’t sleep!” he cried.</p><p>“Why can’t you sleep?” she asked. “You were so tired.”</p><p>“I can’t sleep because I am dying,” he said, and lay down on the couch.</p><p>“Is it your stomach? Do you want me to call Dr. Solov?”</p><p>“No doctors, no doctors,” he moaned. “To the devil with doctors! We must get him out of there quick. Otherwise, we’ll be responsible.... Responsible!” He hurled himself into a sitting position, both feet on the floor, thumping his forehead with his clenched fist.</p><p>“All right,” she said quietly. “We will bring him home tomorrow morning.”</p><p>“I would like some tea,”<span data-page="page_final"></span> said her husband and went out to the bathroom.</p><p>Bending with difficulty, she retrieved some playing cards and a photograph or two that had slipped to the floor—the knave of hearts, the nine of spades, the ace of spades, the maid Elsa and her bestial beau. He returned in high spirits, saying in a loud voice, “I have it all figured out. We will give him the bedroom. Each of us will spend part of the night near him and the other part on this couch. We will have the doctor see him at least twice a week. It does not matter what the Prince says. He won’t have much to say anyway, because it will come out cheaper.”</p><p>The telephone rang. It was an unusual hour for it to ring. He stood in the middle of the room, groping with his foot for one slipper that had come off, and childishly, toothlessly, gaped at his wife. Since she knew more English than he, she always attended to the calls.</p><p>”Can I speak to Charlie?” a girl’s dull little voice said to her now.</p><p>“What number do you want? . . . No. You have the wrong number.”</p><p>She put the receiver down gently and her hand went to her heart. “It frightened me,” she said.</p><p>He smiled a quick smile and immediately resumed his excited monologue. They would fetch him as soon as it was day. For his own protection, they would keep all the knives in a locked drawer. Even at his worst, he presented no danger to other people.</p><p>The telephone rang a second time.</p><p>The same toneless, anxious young voice asked for Charlie.</p><p>“You have the incorrect number. I will tell you what you are doing. You are turning the letter ‘o’ instead of the zero.” She hung up again.</p><p>They sat down to their unexpected, festive midnight tea. He sipped noisily; his face was flushed; every now and then he raised his glass with a circular motion, so as to make the sugar dissolve more thoroughly. The vein on the side of his bald head stood out conspicuously, and silvery bristles showed on his chin. The birthday present stood on the table. While she poured him another glass of tea, he put on his spectacles and reëxamined with pleasure the luminous yellow, green, and red little jars. His clumsy, moist lips spelled out their eloquent labels—apricot, grape, beach plum, quince. He had got to crab apple when the telephone rang again. ♦</p>	Vladimir Nabokov	May 15, 1948 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1948/05/15/symbols-and-signs	Birthdays	Children	Immigrants	Insane	Parents	Russians	Unnamed	Third	Immigrants
Szmura’s Room	<p>He <span data-page="page_1"></span>stands at Szmura’s door, his left hand suspended in midair, reluctant to knock. Flanked by two suitcases, one of which is held together by a flayed rope, he is panting, out of shape and undernourished. He is clad in a dark coat, the collar striated with lint and dandruff, the sleeves tragicomically short, exposing his dirt-rimmed shirt cuffs. When Mike Szmura opens the door, wearing nothing but pajama bottoms and a front of frightening chest hair, Bogdan utters his lines in stuttering English. “Right off the boat,” Szmura says in a maliciously nasal voice and steps aside to let our boy enter the apartment, the roped suitcase banging at his ankles, the other one smashing against Szmura’s knee.</p><p>At least, that is how Szmura described it to us later, exhibiting the obscure, alleged bruise on his knobby knee. We had interrupted our poker game (my two jacks were waiting to lure Szmura and Pumpek into surrendering their weekly income) so that Szmura could use his meagre narrative talents to depict and embellish Bogdan’s arrival. The other players—Pumpek and a couple of Realtor buddies he’d brought along to serve as suckers—were unabashedly American, and they waited impatiently for Szmura to finish so the game could go on. But, in a likely attempt to distract me from the game, Szmura added, “He is from your lousy country, <em>Basnia</em>, whatever you call it.” My two jacks promptly responded to the insult, and by the time I had raked in the loot with both hands I had forgotten all about the forlorn foreigner at Szmura’s door.</p><p>At subsequent poker games, I learned more. Szmura attempted to entertain us with a repertoire of dumb-foreigner acts and bad-accent jokes featuring Bogdan, and from these performances I gathered that Bogdan was much like me, an oddity: a Ukrainian from Bosnia, although, unlike me, he was not from Sarajevo. Szmura had no interest in internal Bosnian cultural differences and presupposed that there was a deep, essential kinship between us, which is to say that by mocking Bogdan he was making me the target. I preferred taking his money to taking exception—he had reached the point of writing promissory notes, and I kept them, as if they were love notes, even after he’d made good on them.</p><p>Bogdan had been delivered to Chicago through some lamentably narrow refugee channel—a Ukie priest knew a Ukie priest who knew about a cheap room at Szmura’s. The size of a closet, the room was in the apartment that Szmura rented from his ex-girlfriend’s grandmother, who blissfully decided to ignore the fact that Szmura had permanently and irreversibly dumped the apple of her eye shortly after banging her.</p><p>As small as the room was, it echoed with emptiness. Bogdan parked his suitcases flat in the windowless corner, took a sheet and a blanket out of the unroped one, and spread them under the murky window—unequipped with mattress or duvet, this was where he would sleep. The room resembled an installation in a vacuous art gallery: the reflection of the ceiling bulb on the wood floor signifying the false surface of existence, the felled suitcases embodying the transitory nature of life—or, more specifically, the life of the subject, shrimped up in the corner against a bare, mispainted wall. Naturally, it was all very funny. During another poker game at Szmura’s (which I missed), everyone filed into Bogdan’s chamber and found the installation uproariously amusing: they guffawed to the verge of retching and fell to the existential floor, while Bogdan sat in his corner, perplexed by all the wisecracks about his artsy-fartsiness.</p><p>He did eventually get an official tour of the apartment—an introduction to the Szmura world and its impenetrable mysteries. In the living room, with a sweeping movement of his hand, Szmura offered his furniture to Bogdan’s eye: the crimson sofa, with its wide U shape and stern, flat armrests—for some reason, Szmura referred to it as “the Puerto Rican”—and the claret velvet armchair facing it over a pseudo-Oriental coffee table, all Chinese curves and Japanese angles. Bogdan could peruse the Puerto Rican when Szmura was absent, he was told; otherwise the armchair was available. Next, Bogdan had to inspect the collection of objects on the mantelpiece, which consisted of an upright bullet casing that Szmura’s venerable father had brought back from Vietnam; a glass ashtray full of foreign coins (mainly kopecks and zlotys); a bottle of Grolsch beer (“Be very careful,” Szmura said, “ ’coz this bottle is from Florida”); and a figurine of a sow, complete with swollen teats, that was left unmentioned. Bogdan also glanced out the window, which overlooked the same alley as the one in his room. There was nothing to see, of course, except a garage door inching downward like a stage curtain, and a few fallen deciduous leaves slipping inside before it closed.</p><p>In the bathroom, Bogdan was shown the hooks that Szmura used to hang his upper-body (navy blue) and lower-body (azure) towels and his carmine silk robe with a fire-breathing dragon on the back—Bogdan was assigned the fourth hook. He was also told that he must make a habit of lifting the toilet seat, should he put it down for the big dookie, and that he must never shave or piss in the shower. Finally, Szmura pushed a little jar into his face, its bottom lined with yellowish mites—this was where Szmura<span data-page="page_2"></span> collected the wormy stuff from his nose pores.</p><p>In the kitchen, Bogdan was warned that the mug inscribed with “Mikola,” its chipped brim adorned with traditional Ukrainian patterns, was never to be touched. The fridge contained a bowl of intensely red vine tomatoes (“they make the blood strong”), along with Szmura’s black dress shoes on a tray; a plate of rotting shrimp; and a jar of Vaseline, which Bogdan could not fail to conclude was deployed for some form of self-abuse. They did not dwell long over the contents of the pantry. Suffice it to mention a large number of Shake ’n Bake boxes stacked up on the bottom shelf, and an impressive collection of Campbell’s soup cans lined up in alphabetical order on the top two shelves: Shelf No. 1, from Asparagus to Minestrone; Shelf No. 2, from Mushroom to Vegetable. The soup was not for Bogdan, Szmura declared. Were he ever to open a can, he would have to replenish the collection the very same day. Concluding the tour, Szmura flung open the door of his own bedroom, and exposed briefly a darkness into which the light cut a lambent half-rhomboid. Bogdan was never to enter this room, not even if invited. “Think of it,” Szmura said, “as a minefield.”</p><p>Szmura, however, would often freely enter Bogdan’s room, opening the door violently. He would launch into monolithic monologues welcoming Bogdan to this great country, which had been built by immigrants, including Szmura’s own Ukrainian grandparents, who’d had to pull themselves up by their bootstraps and now had a condo in Orlando—which was great, because it meant that there was an opportunity for everybody in this country, even a fuckface D.P. like Bogdan. Bogdan could tell that Szmura enjoyed these speeches; he would stroke the hair coppice on his forearms as he spoke, as if petting himself.</p><p>Szmura’s manner of door-opening was closely linked to his fantasies of becoming an F.B.I. special agent: he was an intern at a law office and watched “Cops” regularly, all in preparation for the F.B.I. entrance exam, which he would take as soon as he graduated from Loyola Law School. Bogdan was made privy to Szmura’s F.B.I. fantasies after he unwisely agreed to a demonstration of a submission technique and quickly found himself on the floor, with Szmura’s knee pressing against his jugular, his elbow and shoulder about to pop. “I could kill you, if I wanted to,” Szmura said matter-of-factly before he let him go.</p><p>Szmura was also a note-leaver. Every morning, Bogdan would find on the kitchen table a note in a taut, wiry handwriting that corresponded somehow to the essence of Szmura: the letter “T” was like his body—straight, slim, angular. The notes occasionally welcomed him again (“Feel at home”), but more often they were directives (“Wash the damn dishes”) or announcements (“Rent due Tuesday”). There were some that stretched themselves thin between nonsense and poetry (“The fireplace is not real”). When Szmura, abruptly and inexplicably, started writing them down in verse form, Bogdan began collecting them. One day, from the desert covering the ruins of Chicago, a rusty box full of faded patches of paper will be excavated, and some good archeologist will discover the soul of a perished civilization in these abstruse verses:</p><p>**<em class="break" data-two="two">{: .break one} ** The door is either Open or locked I like Locked **</em></p><p>Or:</p><p>**<em class="break" data-two="two">{: .break one} ** Your socks are all over How many fucking feet do you have? You are not alone here, buddy Not alone **</em></p><p>Predictably, Bogdan often retreated to his hollow room, lying in the dark, palpating the wall, as if looking for an escape tunnel. Szmura would sometimes bring home a woman—he had an unmistakable taste for the meretricious kind—and Bogdan would listen to their coital exchanges, which always seemed rehearsed, as though they were auditioning for a porn flick. She would implore Szmura to put his big dick inside her, and he would say, Oh yeah, so that’s what you want, bitch, and she would say, Yeah, gimme your big dick, and he would say, Oh yeah, so that’s what you want, bitch, and so it would go, until they approached the climax, when she would squeal in frequencies peculiar to the sound of a wet finger rubbing against glass, while Szmura would embark upon a volley of “fuck”s: fuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuck. He occasionally encouraged his sticky companions to stop by Bogdan’s room and volunteer some secondhand erotic kindness. Only one of them actually did: wearing nothing but roller skates, a buxom part-time Wicker Park waitress purred kittenishly and scratched on his door. Unable to comprehend what was going on, frightened by the screeching of the roller skates on the floor, Bogdan didn’t stir. The following morning, Szmura left a note saying, “It was a hit and run / Bo / That’s all it was.”</p><p>I do not know what Bogdan made of Szmura, or how aware he was of his insanity. Perhaps he was misled (as I had been) by Szmura’s occasional human impulses: he bequeathed his Shake ’n Bake collection to the Ukie church, to be distributed to newly arrived immigrants; he was known to leave a tip even if the waitress was not fuckable; and one time he left a note saying, “If a bird flies in, let her out.” Most misleading of all,<span data-page="page_3"></span> I think, was the polite good-boy manner that Szmura employed when discoursing with Pany Mayska, his landlady.</p><p>The day after Bogdan moved in, Szmura took him across the hall and knocked at Pany Mayska’s door, a nosegay of fragrant lilies in hand. They heard the slow shuffle of her feet, and Szmura said, “Now, be nice here. No talking out of your ass.” He scowled and rescowled, raising his upper lip and distending his nostrils—a grimace that Bogdan would one day learn to recognize as threatening. Pany Mayska was puny, her face powdered and centered on a small, rouged mouth, her hair sparse, exposing the white streaks of her skull. She wore a pointy bra that might have been alluring half a century ago but now served as a scaffold for her cavernous chest. Szmura greeted her in Ukrainian and kissed her on the cheek, while she grabbed his lilyless hand and did not let him withdraw it, pulling him in. Her fingers were like claws, withered and twisted. Her apartment reeked of pee and pierogi, of cleanliness and ironed bedsheets. The smell travelled quickly through Bogdan’s synapses until it reached the room where his grandmother had died: Ukrainian handiwork of the same geometric pattern multiplied on the tablecloth and the cushions; obsolete church calendars scattered around; a pensive etching of the poet Taras Shevchenko, glowering over his scrubby mustache; icons of bent-neck Virgins with chunky toddlers at their bosoms.</p><p>Szmura asked after Pany Mayska’s health and she said it was fine—both of them all hearty smiles. Szmura might have slapped her on the back had it not been for her frailty. And how was Victor, her grandson? Oh, he was fine, uncovering ancient Slavic grave sites near Kharkiv. He’d be home by Christmas. And how was Oksana? Ah, she still didn’t have a boyfriend. “Mikola, I would have liked so much to have you as my grandson-in-law.” “Pani Majcka, I am too young to get married,” Szmura said. She sighed pensively, as if Mike Szmura were the unfulfilled love of her own youth, her vanished dream.</p><p>Bogdan sat and listened with a general grin that suggested that he was interested but not prying. She stood up with creaking difficulty and reached for a bowl on the immaculately clean counter. When she put the bowl down on the table, it was full of crescent cookies. “And who are you?” she asked, pushing the bowl toward Bogdan. He gently jerked his head to express his willingness to taste a cookie, and then he told her who he was, with fatigued detachment, as if retelling the plot of a tedious Eastern European movie.</p><p>Szmura had told him that Pany Mayska used to work as a radiologist, taking X-rays of smokers’ scorched lungs and the smashed hips of adventurous seniors. She was so fucking irradiated, Szmura said, that she glowed in the dark, bones coiling in her body, everything inside her rotting splendidly. Perhaps it was owing to her radioactivity that Bogdan could always sense her before she knocked at their door. He would sometimes reach the door before she had even opened hers. Through the peephole, he could see her wobble over with a plateful of pierogi. She knew that Szmura was at work during the day, but she always asked after Mikola. She never agreed to come in, but she stood at the door and made Bogdan tell her, all over again, what he had told her the first time: that he was a Ukrainian from Bosnia, from a small town called Prnjavor; that he used to own a photo shop; that he had been forced to fight for the Serbs in the war and had escaped with nothing but the clothes he wore; and that he now worked at a Jewel supermarket, packing bags until he could find something better. After Bogdan had delivered his last line, she’d hand him the plate, covered with a flimsy serviette and decorated with the same Ukrainian pattern that dominated the rest of her habitat. Then she’d deliver her own lines in the following sequence:</p><p>(a) it was terrible what was going on in Bosnia; it reminded her of the Great Famine, when millions of Ukrainians died; she prayed that it would end soon;</p><p>(b) did Bogdan ever think about all the places where Ukrainians could be found: we were everywhere, from Bosnia to the jungles of Uruguay; and</p><p>(c) Ukrainians were very visual people, people who liked pictures; take Disney, for example, who was one of us, a Disnya—he got his many ideas, his artistic inspirations, from Ukrainian national culture, and from our love of nature.</p><p>As rehearsed, Bogdan would extend his mouth into a serious smile and tighten his stomach muscles to suppress any laughter at the idea that Donald Duck was part of his heritage, that Goofy was Ukrainian. He grew to like Pany Mayska and her pastries, and he learned to bask in the glow of her radiation.</p><p>Since she had retired, she volunteered at the Museum of Ukrainian Culture and History, a funereal three-story building right across the parking lot from the Jewel where Bogdan worked. Once, I saw him wandering over there in a green apron and a cap that would have been fashionable in Eastern Europe decades ago. (I was pretty sure it was him; I hadn’t met him yet, but the tired gait, more than anything<span data-page="page_4"></span> else, gave him away.) Pany Mayska opened the door and waived the two-dollar entrance fee with an understanding nod. Bogdan stepped into a room suffused with a green darkness, its light dammed by heavy curtains.</p><p>She looked even smaller and more radiant in the sepulchral murk. Bogdan followed her, feigning interest, past painted wooden eggs and sallow bobbin-lace, his chest reverberating with sorrow. It all made him think of the shabby armoire in his grandparents’ bedroom, which he had dug through as a child, in search of the creased photos from their childhood. Pany Mayska ascended the stairs to a room that told, she said, the story of our people. The room was curtainless, with dust particles floating all around as the sunlight blazed outside. She pointed at a glass case under the window: a cracked bread trough, an eagle-shaped medal coated with psoriatic rust; a letter whose cursive was melting into bluish waves. Bogdan wondered whether the letter had been brought over from the old country or never sent back from this one. Then they walked along the walls, studying photos of ghastly, famine-wasted peasants lined up for the camera, as if for execution, and portraits of stiff, black-and-white men who had come over a long time ago, their eyes bulging as their tightly knotted ties cut off their airflow. Pany Mayska stopped in front of a picture of a pinheaded man with a thick mustache and round thin-rimmed glasses—this was her husband, she said, with a quiver in her voice. And then they went downstairs, to the small kitchen, where Bogdan accepted a glass of diluted raspberry concentrate, a bagful of almost expired TV dinners that she just happened to have lying around, and a report on how she had once caught Oksana and Szmura kissing, and they were only twelve years old!</p><p>I must confess that I waited in the Jewel’s parking lot with the intention of intercepting Bogdan. It was time, I thought, for us to meet. He reminded me a lot of myself, as I had been not so long ago: I, too, had had to deal with the conundrum of the Social Security number, with the recondite rules of baseball, and with the immutable laws of living with Szmura. I, too, had resisted the temptation to slurp Szmura’s soup and had accepted bags of TV dinners and dried Twinkies from Pany Mayska. Once, she had even lent me money, which I had never paid back—which was why I avoided her now, crossing the street whenever I saw her hobbling arthritically toward me.</p><p>When Bogdan stepped out of the museum, carrying a weighty paper bag, he appeared taller, clumsily hunched forward, much like Goofy. I accosted him close to the cart rack. It surprised me that he wasn’t surprised. He recognized me, he said—I looked like my cousin Roman, with whom he had gone to school back in Prnjavor.</p><p>I had practiced my lines. I had planned to inquire about his parents and offer him my generous help. I wanted to tell him to get the hell out of Szmura’s place as soon as he could. Instead, I found myself nodding meaninglessly, like a congenitally embarrassed American, to convey that he had my support and understanding, even if I could not comprehend what he was talking about. “You will never know what you escaped,” he said. “You will never know how lucky you are.” He told me how he had buried his parents in their back yard. He had been conscripted into the Serb Army and fought at Derventa. He had seen unspeakable things: people forced into minefields, pregnant women cut open, eyes gouged out with rusty spoons, his fellow-soldiers pissing into a mass grave. All he’d been able to think of was escaping, so much so that he had felt relief when his parents died—though I don’t know if he said this or I just inferred it. Jewel customers—young blond mothers, old men reeking of mothballs, drunks with paper-bagged Wild Irish Rose—were responsibly returning their carts to the rack. “It is painful to remember what I cannot forget,” he said, possibly quoting a Ukrainian song I did not know. So I made up an incontestably urgent task, expressed my eagerness to get together soon, offered unspecified help, and took off across the lot. After that, I avoided him for years.</p><p>"That museum, it creeps me out, man,” Szmura said, shuddering. “Why the fuck would Bo go there?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” I said. “Maybe it reminds him of home. Maybe he gets cozy with old Mayska.”</p><p>“Maybe you can write a nice story about that one day,” Pumpek said. “Right now, you gotta deal.”</p><p>“I don’t understand those people. That fucking old bitch has lived in this fucking country for fifty fucking years, and all she talks about is our people and the famine and Disney and fucking Ukraine,” Szmura said.</p><p>“Deal,” Pumpek said.</p><p>“It is heartbreaking,” I said. “All that sorrow.”</p><p>“It is dick-breaking,” Szmura said. “You know what the Ukie anthem is? ‘Ukraine hasn’t died yet.’ Hasn’t fucking died yet! Well, let it die, man. This is America, not a psychiatric, you know, facility.”</p><p>“Deal,” Pumpek said.</p><p>I dealt, to Szmura and Pumpek and the two real-estate guys, who said nothing, all gambling ice and calculation. One of them kept shuffling his chips while staring straight at me, obviously (and foolishly)<span data-page="page_5"></span> designating me as the sucker. The other stood up and got himself a beer. I realized they were brothers.</p><p>“I am worried about Bo,” Szmura said. “I want him to start living in America, stop living in the past. Those old vampires are not good for him. And he’s not even from Ukraine, he’s from fucking <em>Basnia</em>. I’m gonna take him under my wing. We gotta integrate him in this society.”</p><p>“<em>Integrate</em>,” the brother with the beer said all of a sudden. “Where’d you learn such a fancy word?”</p><p>And so Szmura took Bogdan under his vulture’s wing. He gave him impromptu lessons in American history: he made him admire the big balls that graced the groins of the Founding Fathers; he narrated the great epic of saving the world from the freedom-hating menace, in several installments (Vietnam, Grenada, the Gulf); he encouraged him to watch television, to appreciate the richness of American culture; he painted the vast canvas of capitalism in a few simple strokes—free market, free enterprise, money in the bank.</p><p>One day, he invited Bogdan to sit in on a business meeting he was going to have with an acquaintance. Perhaps Bogdan was truly excited to learn something at the Szmura Institute of Integration, but it was more likely that it was much too complicated for him to say no. Besides, Szmura had offered to let him sleep, on weeknights, on the Puerto Rican couch.</p><p>“All I want you to do,” Szmura said, “is to sit there and say nothing. If I start going after the guy, or grab him by the neck, stop me. I want you to stop me.” He installed Bogdan on the Puerto Rican, and put a bottle of Jack Daniel’s at the center of the coffee table and a bowl of cherry tomatoes next to it. He told Bogdan that the guy who was coming over needed a favor and that it was hard for him to say no, “ ’coz the guy’s father is the mayor of Springbrook.” That, of course, did not sound particularly impressive to Bogdan, but before he could ask anything Szmura was off to the kitchen to get glasses. Light filtered through the whiskey bottle and an ochre penumbra flickered on the table.</p><p>“Everyone knows that Springbrook is a Mob town,” Szmura yelled from the kitchen. “This guy’s dad has, you know, connections, and they could be useful when I’m with the F.B.I.”</p><p>Naturally, Bogdan was uneasy at the idea of being caught between the Mob and the F.B.I., but he was titillated, too, as anyone would be. When the bell rang, he leaned back in the Puerto Rican, crossed his legs, intertwined his fingers over his stomach, and tried to relax his face so it would appear sullen and cold. Szmura walked in with a tall, skinny dude in a baseball hat, seated him in the armchair, and sat next to Bogdan, whom he introduced as his “friend and associate.” Jack was poured (by Bogdan); thoughts on certain celebrity chicks and their fake tits were exchanged. The skinny dude was sweating, and Szmura was spreading his arms across the back of the Puerto Rican, his forearm touching the back of Bogdan’s head. He and the skinny guy both glanced at Bogdan at the same time, as if he were a conduit for an encoded transmission.</p><p>“Tell me, Michael,” Szmura finally said. “How can I help you?”</p><p>“Here’s my problem,” Michael said, “and I don’t want you to misunderstand my position here.”</p><p>Bogdan felt the intense presence of Szmura and Michael in the room; he smelled their semi-criminal arousal, and everything, everything decelerated. There was a woman, Michelle. She was a great, fantastic chick, and Michael sort of loved her. (Bogdan imagined her: tall, graceful, and pensive.) But she had been having a bit of a drug problem. It had started out in college; a little pot, some E, occasionally some hard stuff, but only on weekends and holidays, when everyone else was doing it. (He saw a dark basement thumping with degenerate music, youths slumped in the corners, the whites of their eyes webbed with blood.) Michael himself had dropped it all, owing to his baseball and all, and he’d been working real hard—no booze, no drugs, just clean pussy. There had been some interest from minor leagues, pretty serious, too, the Cubs’ stable team, no less, a lot of money in the offing, a lot. Michelle, though, had not quit partying. She swore she got high only on weekends, but then Michael found out from a buddy of his that she was, in fact, doing shitloads of drugs. She had been fucking her dealer, too, his buddy said, so Michael confronted her. (Bogdan envisioned a soundless screaming match, tears pouring off her round cheeks.) She was sorry and shit, but she admitted that she was full-hooked on coke and she owed a lot of money to her dealer, some cultural-studies creep. He had forced her to fuck him. (A closeup of a woman’s hand against a hairy back.) Michael went and talked to the creep, told him to fuck off. But the multi-culti motherfucker wanted his money back. He was entitled to it, he had earned it, and he had some pretty big ass-whupping friends. Michael was afraid that he might force Michelle to fuck other guys to pay the debt. (A tableaux of<span data-page="page_6"></span> panting, unctuous bodies, limbs entangled like mating snakes.)</p><p>“I hear ya,” Szmura said. “So you wanna pay him off?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Michael said. He needed to clean up the mess; he needed to put his money where his dick was. Otherwise, it would fuck up his baseball career, and baseball was his life. Bogdan did not entirely understand all this, but the grandeur of Michael’s dilemma did not escape him.</p><p>“There’s plenty of pussy in the sea,” Szmura said.</p><p>“I am afraid I like to swim in my own pool.”</p><p>“Why don’t you talk to your dad?”</p><p>“My family is not known for sensitivity,” he said. “I just wanna pay the motherfucker and get my woman off his dick. I’d love to have his limbs scattered all over rural Illinois, but I gotta be realistic.”</p><p>Szmura looked at Bogdan, as if telepathically consulting with him. “Twenty-five per cent,” he said. “Standard rate among friends. How much do you need?”</p><p>“Ten Gs.”</p><p>“I’ll have the money for you tomorrow, and a promissory note to sign, too.”</p><p>“I’ll sign whatever you want me to.”</p><p>“Fantastic,” Szmura said with a snort of approbation. He grabbed a handful of tomatoes and popped them, one by one, into his mouth.</p><p>“Don’t take this personally, Michael,” he said, “but I feel that it is my professional obligation to mention that I would have to take measures, you know, should you fail to make a scheduled payment. I might, for one, have to talk to your dad.”</p><p>“Understandable,” Michael slurred.</p><p>“And for the sake of my business image”—he glanced at Bogdan, who beamed with voyeuristic trepidation—“I might have to punish you. Nothing big, certainly not enough to endanger your baseball career, but I’m gonna have to send Bo here to address the problem.”</p><p>“Understandable,” Michael said, and looked at Bogdan, who, out of discomfort, folded his hands into fists—doubtless looking to Michael as if he were preparing to smash his face in.</p><p>“Bogdan here,” Szmura said, “is from <em>Basnia</em>. There was a war there, horrible stuff. He has seen things that you and I cannot begin to imagine. They slice people up over there like fucking kielbasa. So he is a little troubled, if you get what I mean. He’s a bit beyond therapy. But I’m sure he’ll be able to control himself, now that he knows you.”</p><p>Here Bogdan fully assumed his role: he flexed his neck; he grinned at Michael, and his left incisor sparkled with the menace of a war criminal. Then he muttered, “Yes,” in a deep, Slavic voice, and grabbed a couple of tomatoes. Szmura leaned back into the Puerto Rican and spread his legs triumphantly, as if to exhibit the size of his testosterone-choked testicles.</p><p>A few days later, spring parachuted into Chicago: the air was abruptly warm and fragrant, the grass was suddenly green, as if it had been painted overnight. Bogdan started growing a mustache and dreamed of buying a camera. He established an after-work ritual that involved lounging on the Puerto Rican, reading the weather forecast (“Mild with gusty morning T-storms. Clear skies in the afternoon”) while sipping a thimbleful of Jack on the rocks. His life began to contain small, repeatable pleasures.</p><p>Szmura even took him out for drinks once, to the Rainbo Club, no less, where they would have picked up two redheaded sisters, had it not been for Bogdan’s reticence. I watched them, from the far corner, where I was partly hidden behind an excitable pinball machine, as Szmura did the charming, while Bogdan stared at his almost empty glass—he avoided finishing the drink because he couldn’t afford to buy a round. He didn’t say a word, just kept looking up at one of the sisters (her name was Julia) and smiling sheepishly. Szmura kept buying drinks, and finally he delivered his killer pickup line: “When you get fucked up, we can take you home.” Such boldness had worked for him before, but this time the sisters just stood up and left, Julia bestowing a parting glance at Bogdan, which Szmura interpreted as an invitation to a fuckfest.</p><p>Bogdan spent the night taking long imaginary walks with Julia, holding her imaginary hand, but didn’t, in the end, dare to imagine making love to her on the spine-twisting Puerto Rican. Dawn arrived with a fanfare of chirruping sparrows, and Bogdan passed out under the weight of what could very loosely be called happiness.</p><p>He woke up late and scratched his stomach and buttocks for a while, yawning. He sauntered over to the kitchen and poured himself a cup of the feeble coffee that Szmura had kindly prepared. Then he read the note that Szmura had left on the table. He stood up to add cream to his coffee, then read it again, and this time he understood what it meant:</p><p>**<em class="break" data-two="two">{: .break one} ** I am afraid, Bo, You gonna have to go I need your room Michael is bringing Michelle Pussy protection program Pay what you can And leave **</em></p><p>In Bosnia, there is a typically cruel and precise idiom that is used to describe the behavior and movement of a frightened person—such an individual is said to act like a beheaded fly. Here was the headless Bogdan flying to his room to take off his pajamas, then collapsing on the Puerto Rican to stare for a long time<span data-page="page_final"></span> at the unreal fireplace. Finally, he made it back to his room to put on his Jewel uniform, and then he headed for the pantry, as if looking for a place to hide. There he found himself facing the soup collection, despair grinding through his bowels. He read every label carefully, examined each can—but Asparagus remained stubbornly silent, Onion and Split Pea regarded him with hatred, and he had no choice but to put his faith in the strength of Tomato. He poured what resembled congealed blood into a pot and waited for a blistery boil to break the surface. He ravenously slurped up the potion, while reading the note again, his blue shirt sprinkled with drops of red.</p><p>Pany Mayska’s radiation enveloped him before he had even knocked at her door. When she appeared, wearing slippers with pompoms at the end of their curled tips, as if she were an aging princess from Baghdad, he told her about Szmura’s note. She pressed her hand against her chest and gasped, acknowledging the imminence of hurt and humiliation. But she said she believed that Mikola had only done what he had to do; he meant well, and it was a very small room anyway. Bogdan wanted her dried lips against his cheek; he wanted her to hold his perspiring hand and comfort him, as his grandmother would have, but she stood away. She offered to let him stay at the museum—there was an empty room in the back—until he figured something out. A cloudlet of boiled-dough smell wafted out of her apartment, and Bogdan had the heart-wrenching feeling that he was saying goodbye to her. She gasped understandingly again, and withdrew back into the darkness of her home.</p><p>The door to Szmura’s room was as heavy as cast iron, as if it led to a dungeon. Bogdan entered, fully aware that once he was inside there would be no turning back. He saw a dishevelled bed, a scree of comforter in the center, a head crater in the pillow. A full beaker of water stood by the bed, bubbles pressed against its glass wall. A tie stretched across the chair, like a severed tendon. The digital clock hysterically flashed 12:00. A book (“Chicken Soup for the Baseball Fan’s Soul”) spread its wings on the floor. From under the bed, a pair of stolid twenty-pound dumbbells protruded just enough for Bogdan to stub his big toe. In the closet, suits were lined up, in a spectrum of colors from azure to navy; below the suits, Szmura’s shoes stood in an impeccably slanted row, like cars in a parking lot. The underwear occupied different shelves: the boxers on the top, the jockeys on the bottom, the undershirts in the middle, precisely aligned in stacks.</p><p>On the wall above Szmura’s desk hung a map of Florida, with an inset of the Keys. On the desk there were piles of inscrutable papers; pencil shavings (calling up the smell of school in Prnjavor: pencils, the wet eraser sponge, and girls’ freshly washed hair); a computer monitor in which Bogdan could see a bent reflection of himself; a tin cookie box containing baseball cards, fluorescent condoms, a pouch of pot. In the drawer, a black ball of socks; a grotesquely orange orange; a roll of twenty-dollar bills. Bogdan unrolled it and counted the money: twenty-three hundred dollars—he took eighty, then rolled it back up. There was a holstered .38-calibre gun in another drawer, loaded and heavy. He unlocked it and pointed it at the window. <em>Bang. Bang</em>. He put the barrel in his mouth: it tasted metallic, bitter and sweet.</p><p>A tongue of paper was hanging out of the fax machine: “Stock Alert!” and a confirmation from South Beach Heaven, “An Escort Service You Can Trust.” In the garbage can, he found a drawing of a dog humping a smiley face with the inscription “Fuck Ya!” On the windowsill, a rotten cactus perched over a pile of photos, almost all featuring Szmura with a multicolored cocktail in his hand, surrounded by a choir of sunny young men and women. At the bottom of the pile, there was a sallow photo of a boy sitting sideways on a luge, his wool-capped head deposited despondently on his knees, surrounded by flat whiteness. Bogdan recognized the soporific sadness of the boy, the feeling of being stuck outside in the cold when one wanted to be inside, at home and warm.</p><p>He was folding the photo to put it in his pocket when Szmura charged across the room, leaping over the bed, and blew Bogdan’s left eye right out of the socket with his first punch. ♦</p>	Aleksandar Hemon	June 14, 2004 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/06/14/szmuras-room	Apartments	Boarders	Chicago	Immigrants	Notes	Poker	Szmura	First	Immigrants
The Boundary	<p>Every Saturday, a new family comes to stay. Some arrive early in the morning, from afar, ready to begin their vacation. Others don’t turn up until sunset, in bad moods, maybe having lost their way. It’s easy to get lost in these hills; the roads are poorly signposted.</p><p>Today, after they introduce themselves, I show them around. My mother used to do the welcoming. But she’s spending the summer in a nearby town, helping out an elderly gentleman who’s also on vacation, so I have to do it.</p><p>As usual, there are four of them: mother, father, two daughters. They follow me, their eyes wide, happy to stretch their legs.</p><p>We stop for a moment on the shaded patio that looks out over the lawn, under a thatched roof that filters the light. There are two armchairs and a sofa, covered with white fabric, lounge chairs for sunbathing, and a wooden table big enough for ten people.</p><p>I open the sliding glass door and show them inside: the cozy living room with two comfortable sofas in front of the fireplace, the well-stocked kitchen, two bedrooms.</p><p>While the father unloads the car and the girls, who are probably around seven and nine, disappear into their room, shutting the door behind them, I tell the mother where to find extra towels, and woollen blankets, in case it gets cold at night.</p><p>I show her where the mouse poison is hidden. Kill the flies before going to bed, I suggest, otherwise they start buzzing at dawn and become a nuisance. I explain how to get to the supermarket, how to use the washing machine behind the house, and where to hang the laundry, just on the other side of my father’s garden.</p><p>Guests are free to pick lettuce and tomatoes, I add. There were lots of tomatoes this year, but most of them spoiled in the July rain.</p><p>I pretend not to watch them, to be discreet. I do the housework and water the garden, but I can’t help noticing how happy and excited they are. I hear the girls’ voices as they run across the lawn, I learn their names. Since the guests usually leave the sliding door open, I overhear what the parents say to each other as they settle into the house, as they unpack their suitcases and decide what to have for lunch.</p><p>The cottage where my family lives is a few yards away, behind a tall hedge that forms a kind of screen. For years, our house was just a room that served as both kitchen and bedroom for the three of us. Then, two years ago, when I turned thirteen, my mother started working for the elderly gentleman, and, after saving up enough money, my parents asked the man who owns the property if they could add a small room for me.</p><p>My father is the caretaker. He looks after the big house, chops the wood, works the fields and the vineyard. He looks after the horses, which the owner loves with a passion.</p><p>The owner lives abroad, but he’s not a foreigner like us. He comes every now and then, on his own. He doesn’t have a family. During the days he goes horseback riding; in the evenings he reads in front of the fireplace. Then he goes away again.</p><p>Not many people rent his house other than in summer. The winters here are biting, and in the spring there’s lots of rain. In the mornings, from September to June, my father drives me to school, where I feel out of place. I don’t mix easily with others; I don’t look like anyone else.</p><p>The girls in this family resemble each other. You can tell right away that they’re sisters. They’ve already put on matching bathing suits to go to the beach later on. The beach is about fifteen miles from here. The mother looks like a girl, too. She’s small and thin, she wears her long hair loose. Her shoulders are delicate. She walks barefoot on the grass even though the father tells her not to, saying (and he’s right) that there might be porcupines, hornets, snakes.</p><p>After just a few hours, it’s as if they’d always lived here. The things they’ve brought for a week in the country are scattered all over the place: books, magazines, a laptop computer, dolls, hoodies, colored pencils, pads of paper, flip-flops, sunscreen. At lunch I hear forks striking plates. I notice each time one of them sets a glass down on the table. I detect the calm thread of their conversation, the sound and smell of the coffeepot, smoke from a cigarette.</p><p>After lunch, the father asks one of the girls to bring him his glasses. For a long time, he studies a road map. He lists small towns to visit nearby, archeological sites, ruins. The mother isn’t interested. She says this is her only week of the year without appointments and obligations.</p><p>Later on, the father heads off to the sea with his daughters. He asks me, as they’re leaving, how long it takes to get there, which of the beaches is nicest. He asks me about the weather forecast for the week, and I tell him there’s a heat wave coming.</p><p>The mother stays home. She’s put on her bathing suit anyway, to get some sun.<span data-page="page_2"></span></p><p>She stretches out on one of the lounge chairs. I assume she’s going to take a nap, but when I go to hang up the wash I see her writing something. She writes by hand, in a little notebook resting on her thighs.</p><p>Now and then she lifts her head and looks intently at the landscape that surrounds us. She stares at the various greens of the lawn, the hills, the woods in the distance. The glaring blue of the sky, the yellow hay. The bleached fence and the low stone wall that marks the property line. She studies everything I look at every day. But I wonder what else she sees in it.</p><p>When the sun starts to go down, they put on sweaters and long pants to shield themselves from mosquitoes. The father and the girls have wet hair from the hot showers they took after the beach.</p><p>The girls tell their mother about their trip: the burning sand, the slightly murky water, the gentle, disappointing waves. The whole family goes for a short walk. They go to look at the horses, the donkeys, a wild boar kept in a pen behind the stables. They go to see the flock of sheep that passes in front of the house every day around this time, blocking, for a few minutes, the cars on the dusty road.</p><p>The father keeps taking pictures with his cell phone. He shows the girls the small plum trees, the fig trees, the olives. He says fruit picked straight from the tree tastes different because it smells of the sun, the countryside.</p><p>The parents open a bottle of wine on the patio. They taste some cheese, the local honey. They admire the blazing landscape and marvel at the huge, glowing clouds, the color of pomegranates in October.</p><p>Evening falls. They hear frogs, crickets, the rustle of the wind. In spite of the breeze, they decide to eat outside, to take advantage of the lingering light.</p><p>My father and I eat inside, in silence. He doesn’t look up when he eats. With my mother away, there’s no conversation during dinner. She’s the one who talks at meals.</p><p>My mother can’t stand this place. Like my father, she comes from much farther away than anyone who vacations here. She hates living in the country, in the middle of nowhere. She says that the people here aren’t nice, that they’re closed.</p><p>I don’t miss her complaining. I don’t like listening to her, even though she’s probably right. Sometimes, when she complains too much, my father sleeps in the car instead of in bed with her.</p><p>After dinner, the girls wander around the lawn, following fireflies. They play with their flashlights. The parents sit on the patio contemplating the starry sky, the intense darkness.</p><p>The mother sips some hot water with lemon, the father a little grappa. They say that being here is all they need, that even the air is different, that it cleanses. How lovely, they say, being together like this, away from everyone.</p><p>First thing in the morning, I go to the chicken coop to gather eggs. They’re warm and pale, filthy. I put a few in a bowl and bring them to the guests for breakfast. Normally there’s no one around and I just leave them on the patio table. But then I notice, through the sliding door, that the girls are already awake. I see bags of cookies on the sofa, crumbs, a cereal box overturned on the coffee table.</p><p>The girls are trying to swat the flies that buzz around the house in the morning. The older one is holding the flyswatter. The little sister, frustrated, complains that she’s still waiting for her turn. She says she wants to swat them, too.</p><p>I put down the eggs and go back to our house. Then I knock on their door and lend the girls our flyswatter; that way they’re both happy. I don’t repeat the fact that it’s better to kill the flies before you go to bed. It’s clear that they’re having fun while the parents, in spite of the annoying flies and the girls’ racket, continue sleeping.</p><p>After two days, a predictable routine sets in. In the late morning, the father goes to the café in town, to buy milk and the paper, to get a second coffee. He pops over to the supermarket if need be. When he gets back, he goes running in the hills despite the humidity. One time he comes home rattled after crossing paths with a sheepdog that blocked his way, even though in the end nothing happened.</p><p>The mother does what I do: she sweeps the floor, cooks, washes dishes. At least once a day she hangs up the laundry. Our clothes mingle and dry on a shared line. She tells her husband, clasping the laundry basket in her arms, how happy this makes her. Since they live in the city, in a crowded apartment, she can never hang their clothes out in the open like this.</p><p>After lunch, the father takes the girls to the beach and the mother stays home alone. She stretches out and smokes a cigarette, writing in her notebook with an air of concentration.</p><p>One day, back from the beach, the girls run around for hours trying to catch crickets that jump through the<span data-page="page_3"></span> grass. They snatch them up. They put a few in a jar with little pieces of tomato stolen from their parents’ salads. They turn them into pets, even naming them. The next day the crickets die, suffocated in the jar, and the girls cry. They bury them under one of the plum trees and put some wildflowers on top.</p><p>Another day, the father discovers that one of the flip-flops he’d left outside is missing. I tell him that a fox probably took it; there’s been one prowling around. I tell my father, who knows the habits and hideouts of all the animals around here, and he manages to find the shoe, along with a ball and a shopping bag abandoned by the previous family.</p><p>I realize how much the guests like this rural, unchanging landscape, how much they appreciate every detail, how these things help them think, rest, dream. When the girls pick blackberries, staining the pretty dresses they’re wearing, the mother doesn’t get mad at them. Instead she laughs. She asks the father to take a picture, and then throws the dresses in the wash.</p><p>At the same time I wonder what they know about the loneliness here. What do they know about the days, always the same, in our dilapidated cottage? The nights when the wind blows so hard the earth seems to shake, or when the sound of rain keeps me awake? The months we live alone among the hills, the horses, the insects, the birds that pass over the fields? Would they like the harsh quiet that reigns here all winter?</p><p>On the last night, more cars arrive. Friends of the parents have been invited along with their children, who run around on the meadow. A couple of people report that the traffic was light coming in from the city. The adults take a look around the house, and walk in the garden at sunset. The table on the patio is already set.</p><p>I hear everything as they eat. The laughter and chatter are louder tonight. The family relates all their mishaps in the country: the tomato-eating crickets, the funeral under the plum tree, the sheepdog, the fox that carried off the flip-flop. The mother says that being in touch with nature like this has been good for the girls.</p><p>At a certain point a cake comes out, with candles, and I realize it’s the father’s birthday. He’s turning forty-five. Everyone sings and they slice the cake.</p><p>My father and I finish up some overripe grapes. I’m about to clear the table when I hear a knock at the door. I see the girls, hesitant, out of breath. They give me a plate with two slices of cake on it: one for me and one for my father. They dash off before I can say thanks.</p><p>We eat the cake while the guests talk about politics, trips, life in the city. Someone asks the mother where she got the cake. It came from a bakery in their neighborhood, she says, adding that one of the other guests brought it up. She mentions the name of the bakery, the piazza where it’s situated.</p><p>My father lays down his fork and lowers his head. His eyes are agitated when he looks at me. He gets up abruptly and then steps out to smoke a cigarette, unobserved.</p><p>We used to live in the city, too. My father sold flowers in that very piazza. My mother used to help.</p><p>They spent their days next to each other in a small but pleasant stand, arranging bouquets that people took home to decorate their tables and terraces. New to this country, they learned the names of the flowers: rose, sunflower, carnation, daisy. They kept them, their stems submerged, in a row of buckets.</p><p>One night three men showed up. My father was alone; my mother, pregnant with me at the time, was at home, because he didn’t want her to work at night. It was late. The other stores around the piazza were closed, and my father was about to lower his grate.</p><p>One of the men asked him to open up again, saying that he was about to go and see his girlfriend. He wanted a nice bouquet. My father agreed that he’d make him one, even though the men were rude, a little drunk.</p><p>When my father held up the bouquet the man said that it was skimpy and asked him to make it bigger. My father added more flowers, an excessive number of them, until the man was satisfied. He wrapped paper around the bouquet, then he bound it up with colored ribbon, tying a bow. He told him the price.</p><p>The man pulled some money out of his wallet. It wasn’t enough. And when my father refused to hand over the bouquet the man told him that he was an idiot, that he didn’t even know how to put together a nice bouquet for a beautiful girl. Then, together with the others, he started beating my father until his mouth filled with blood, until his front teeth were shattered.</p><p>My father yelled, but at that hour no one heard. They said, Go back to wherever you came from. They took the bouquet and left him like that on the ground.</p><p>My father went to the emergency room. He couldn’t eat solid foods for a year. After<span data-page="page_final"></span> I was born, when he saw me for the first time, he couldn’t say a word.</p><p>Ever since, he’s struggled to speak. He garbles his words, as if he were an old man. He’s ashamed to smile, because of his missing teeth. My mother and I understand him, but others don’t. They think, since he’s a foreigner, that he doesn’t speak the language. Sometimes they even think he’s mute.</p><p>When the pears and red apples that grow in the garden are ripe, we cut them into thin slices, almost transparent, so that he can savor them.</p><p>One of his compatriots told him about this job, in this secluded place. He wasn’t familiar with the countryside: he’d always lived in cities.</p><p>He can live and work here without opening his mouth. He’s not afraid of being attacked. He prefers to live among the animals, cultivating the land. He’s become used to this untamed place that protects him.</p><p>When he talks to me, as he drives me to school, he always says the same thing: that he couldn’t make anything of his life. All he wants me to do is study and finish school, go to college, and then go far away from them.</p><p>The next day, late in the morning, the father starts to load the car. I see four people, tanned, even more closely knit. They don’t want to leave. At breakfast they say that they’d like to come back next year. Nearly all the guests say the same thing when they go. A few faithfully return, but for most of them once is enough.</p><p>Before heading out, the mother shows me the stuff in the fridge that they don’t want to take back to the city. She tells me that she’s grown quite fond of this house, that she already misses it. Maybe, when she’s feeling stressed, or overwhelmed by work, she’ll think of this place: the clean air, the hills, the clouds blazing at sunset.</p><p>I wish the family safe travels and say goodbye. I stand there waiting until the car’s out of sight. Then I start to prepare the house for the new family that’s supposed to get here tomorrow. I make the beds. I tidy the room the girls turned upside down. I sweep the flies they swatted.</p><p>They’ve forgotten, or left on purpose, a few things they don’t need, things I hold on to. Pictures the girls drew, shells they picked up at the beach, the last drops of a perfumed shower gel. Shopping lists in the faint, small script that the mother used, on other sheets of paper, to write all about us. ♦</p><p>(<em>Translated, from the Italian, by the author.</em>)</p>	Jhumpa Lahiri	January 29, 2018 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/01/29/the-boundary	Vacations	Families	Trauma	Italy	Immigrants		Unnamed	First	Immigrants
The Fugitive	<p>They told him he had to wear a mask in public. Which was ridiculous. It made him feel like he had a target painted on his back—or his face, actually, right in the middle of his face. But if he wanted to walk out the door of the clinic he was going to walk out with that mask on—either that or go to jail. Outside, it was raining, which made everything that much harder, because what were you going to do with a wet mask? How could you even breathe? Here, inside the office, with the doctor and his caseworker from Health Services, there was no sound of the rain, or if there was he couldn’t hear it—all he could hear was the rasp and wheeze of his own compromised breathing as he sucked air through the fibres of the mask.</p><p>The doctor was saying something to him now, and Marciano watched him frame the words with his hands before they both looked to the caseworker, a short slim woman with a big bust and liquid eyes, whom he would have liked to fuck if he weren’t so sick. She was named Rosa Hinojosa, and he kept saying her name in his head, because of the way it rhymed, which somehow made him feel better.</p><p>“You understand what the doctor is telling you?” she asked in her clipped north-of-the-border Spanish, which he could have listened to all day under other circumstances. But these were the circumstances, and until he got better he would have to play their game, Dr. Rosen’s game and Rosa Hinojosa’s, too.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>“No more lapses, you understand that? You will report here at eight each morning, when the clinic opens, for your intravenous medication, and”—she held up two plastic pill containers—“you will take your oral medication, <em>without fail</em>, every night at dinner. And you must wear your mask at all times.”</p><p>“Even when I’m alone?”</p><p>She looked to the doctor, said something to him in English, nodded, then turned back to Marciano, her breasts straining at the fabric of her blouse, a pink blouse that made her look even younger than she was, which, he guessed, was maybe twenty-four or five. “You have your own room in this house”—she glanced down at the clipboard in her lap—“at 519 West Haley Street? Is that right?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“There are other roomers there?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“All right. When you’re alone in your room, you can remove the mask, but only then, and never if you’re in the common area. You’re highly contagious, and if you were to cough without the mask on, the bacteria could get into the air and infect your roommates, and you wouldn’t want that, would you?”</p><p>No, he agreed, he wouldn’t, but now the doctor was saying something more, his tone harsh and hectoring, and though Marciano didn’t register what he was saying, or not exactly, he got the gist of it: this was his warning, his final warning, and now there could be no appeal. He watched the doctor’s eyes, which looked at him as if he were less than human, something to step on in the street and crush, angry eyes, hateful, and what had he done to deserve this? He’d got sick, that was all—and couldn’t anybody get sick?</p><p>Rosa Hinojosa (her lips were fascinating—plump and adhesive—and he wanted desperately in that moment to get well, if for no other reason than to maybe be able to kiss them) told him what she’d already told him, that because he’d stopped taking his medication a year ago, his case of tuberculosis had mutated into the multi-drug-resistant form, and his life was at risk, because after this there were no more drugs. That was it. They didn’t exist. But there was more, and worse: if he did not comply fully—no lapses—Dr. Rosen would get a court order and incarcerate him to be sure he got the full round of treatment. And why? Not out of charity, entertain no illusions about that, but to protect society, and at a cost—did he even have any idea of the cost?—of as much as two hundred thousand dollars for him alone. She paused. Compressed her lips. Looked to the doctor. Then, as if she were tracking the drift of the very microbes hanging invisibly in the air, she brought her eyes back to him. “You agree?” she demanded.</p><p>He wanted to say yes, of course he did—he wanted to be cured—but he honestly didn’t know if he could go through with it, and wasn’t that the problem last time? He’d taken the medicine, which was no easy thing, because it made him sick to his stomach and made him itch, as if there were something under his skin clawing its way out. They’d told him he’d have to stay on the regimen anywhere from six to thirty months, but within three months he’d felt fine, his cough nearly gone and his arms and chest filling out again, so he’d started selling the pills, because he didn’t need them anymore, and then he’d stopped coming to the clinic altogether, until the disease returned to shake him like a rat in a cage and he spat up blood and came back here to their contempt and their antiseptic smells and their masks and their dictates and their ultimatums. He wanted to<span data-page="page_2"></span> say yes, and he tried to, but at that moment the cough came up on him, the long dredging cough that was like the sea drawing back over the stones at low tide, and the inside of the mask was suddenly crimson and he couldn’t seem to stop coughing.</p><p>When finally he looked up, both the doctor and Rosa Hinojosa were wearing masks of their own, and Rosa Hinojosa was pushing a box of disposable surgical masks across the desk to him. He couldn’t see her lips now, only her eyes, and her eyes—as rich and brown as two chocolates in the dark wrappers of her lashes—didn’t have an ounce of sympathy left in them.</p><p>Before he got sick the second time, he’d been working as part of a crew that did landscaping and gardening for the big estates strung out along the beach and carved out of the hills, a good job, steady, and with a <em>patrón</em> who didn’t try to cheat you. One of his tasks was to trap and dispose of the animals that infested these places—rats, gophers, possums, raccoons, and whatever else tore up the lawns or raided the orchards. His <em>patrón</em> wouldn’t allow the use of poison of any kind—the owners didn’t like it, and it worked its way up the food chain and killed everything out there, which Marciano didn’t think was such a bad proposition, but it wasn’t his job to think. His job was to do as he was told. The gophers weren’t a problem—they died underground, transfixed on the spikes of the Macabee traps he set in the dark cool dirt of their runs—but the possums and the raccoons and even the rats had to be captured alive in Havahart traps of varying sizes, depending on the species. Which raised the question of what to do with them once you’d caught them.</p><p>The first time he did actually catch something—a raccoon—it was on a big thirty-acre estate with its own avocado grove and a fishpond stocked with Japanese koi that cost a thousand dollars each. It was early, misty yet, and when he went to check the cage he’d baited with a dab of peanut butter and half a sardine it was a shock to find the robber itself, with its black mask and tense fingers grasping the mesh as if it were a monkey and not a <em>mapache</em> at all. In the next moment, he was running down the slope to where the <em>patrón</em> was assembling a sprinkler system for a new flower bed, crying out, “I got one, I got one!”</p><p>The <em>patrón</em>, big-bellied but tough, a man who must have been as old as Marciano’s father yet could work alongside his men on the hottest day without even breathing hard, glanced up from what he was doing. “One what?”</p><p>“A raccoon.”</p><p>“O.K., good. Is it a female?”</p><p>A female? What was he talking about? It was a raccoon. What did he expect him to do? Flip it over and inspect its equipment?</p><p>“Because if it’s a female there’ll be more. Get rid of it and reset the trap.”</p><p>Breathless, excited, the microbes working in him, though he didn’t yet know it, Marciano just stood there, puzzled. “Get rid of it how?”</p><p>A steady look. A sigh. “O.K., listen, because I’m only going to tell you once. Take one of those plastic trash cans lined up there behind the garage and fill it with water, right to the top, you understand? Then just drop the cage in, and it’ll be over in three minutes.”</p><p>“You mean drown it, just like that?”</p><p>“What are you going to do, take it home and train it to walk on a leash?” The <em>patrón</em> was grinning now, pleased with his own joke, but there was work to do, and already he was turning back to it. “And do me a favor,” he added, glancing over his shoulder. “Bury it out in the weeds, where Mrs. Lewis won’t have to see it.”</p><p>Why he was thinking of that he couldn’t say, except that he missed the job—and the money—and as he walked to the bus in the rain, the box of face masks tucked under one arm, he wanted to be back there again, under the sun, working, just that, working. They’d scared him at the clinic, they always scared him, and he was feeling light-headed on top of it. The blood was bad, he knew that—he could see it in their eyes. But he was twenty-three years old, and thirty months was like a lifetime sentence, and even then there were no guarantees—Rosa Hinojosa had made that clear. He was sick from the intravenous. His arm was sore. His throat ached. Even his feet didn’t seem to want to coöperate, zigging and zagging, so that he was walking like a drunk.</p><p>The sidewalk before him was strewn with the worms that were coming up out of the earth because if they stayed down there they’d drown, whereas up here, in the rain, they’d have a chance at life before somebody stepped on them or the birds got to them. He liked worms, nature’s recyclers, and he was playing a little game with himself, trying to avoid them and hold in the next cough at the same time, watching his feet and the pattern the worms made on<span data-page="page_3"></span> the pavement, and when he looked up he was right in front of the bar—Herlihy’s—he’d seen from the bus stop but had never been inside of. It was just past ten in the morning and he wasn’t working today—his new job, strictly gardening, was with an old white-haired <em>campesino</em>, Rudy, who booked the clients and then sat in his beater truck and read spy novels while Marciano did all the work—so he really had nothing to do but sit in front of the television in his room all day. That had something to do with it. That and the fact that Rudy had just paid him the day before.</p><p>He didn’t go directly in, but walked by the place as if he were on an errand elsewhere, then stripped off the mask and stuffed it in his pocket, doubled back, and pushed open the door. Inside were all the usual things, neon signs for Budweiser and Coors, a jukebox that might once have worked, honey-colored bottles lined up behind the bar, and the head of a deer—or, no, an elk—jammed into one wall as if this were Alaska and somebody had just shot it. There were three customers, all white, strung together on three adjoining barstools, and the bartender, also white, and fat, with big buttery arms in a short-sleeved shirt. They all turned to look at him as he came in, and that made him nervous, so he chose a stool at the far end of the bar, rehearsing in his head the phrase he was going to give the bartender—“Please, a beer”— which made use of his favorite word in English, and the word wasn’t “please.”</p><p>The bartender heaved himself up off his own stool and came down the bar to him, put two thick white hands on the counter, and asked him something, which must have been “What do you want?,” and Marciano uttered his phrase. There was a moment of ambiguity, the man poised there still, instead of bending to the cooler, and then there was a further question, which he didn’t grasp until the man began rattling off the names of the beers he stocked, pointing as he did so to a line of bottles on the top row, ten or twelve different brands. “Corona,” Marciano said, unfolding a five-dollar bill on the bar, and all at once he was coughing and he put his hand up to cover his mouth, but he couldn’t seem to stop until he had the bottle to his lips, draining it in three swallows, as if he were a nomad who’d just come in off the desert.</p><p>One of the men at the end of the bar said something then, and the other two looked at Marciano and broke out laughing, and whether it was good-natured or not, a little joke at his expense, it made him feel tight in his chest and the cough came up again, so severe this time he thought he was going to pass out. But here was the bartender, saying something more, and what it was he couldn’t imagine, because it wasn’t illegal to cough, was it? But, no, that wasn’t it. The bartender was pointing at the empty bottle, and so Marciano repeated his phrase, “Please, a beer,” and the heavy man bent to the cooler, extracted a fresh Corona, snapped off the cap, and set it before him.</p><p>He sipped the second beer and watched the rain spatter the dirty windows and run off in streaks. At some point, he saw his bus pull up at the stop across the street, a vivid panel of color that made him think of what was waiting for him at home—nothing, zero, exactly zero—and he watched it pull away again as he tried to fight down the scratch in his throat. He was scared. He was angry. And he sat there, staring out into the gloom, drinking one beer after another, and when he coughed, really coughed, they all looked at him and at the wet cardboard box of face masks, then looked away again. Nobody said another word to him, which was all right with him—he just focussed on the television behind the bar, some news channel, and tried to interpret the words the people were saying there while the backdrop shifted from warplanes and explosions to some sort of pageant with models on a runway, looking raccoon-eyed and haughty and not half as good as Rosa Hinojosa. The bloody mask remained in his pocket, and the box of masks, the new ones, stayed right where it was, on the stool beside him.</p><p>All that week, he went into the clinic at eight, as instructed, and all that week he felt nauseated and skipped breakfast and went to work with Rudy anyway, and the only good thing there was that Rudy didn’t like to start early—and he didn’t ask questions, either. Still, Marciano was lagging and he knew it, and knew that it was only a matter of time before Rudy said something. Which he did, that Friday, T.G.I.F., end of the week, the first week with this new cocktail of antibiotics running through his veins, one week down and how many more to go? He did a quick calculation in his head: fifty-two weeks in a year, double that and then add twenty-six more. It was like climbing a mountain backward—no<span data-page="page_4"></span> matter how many steps you took you never got to see the peak.</p><p>They were on their third or fourth house of the day, everything gray and wet with the fog off the ocean and the sun nowhere in sight. His chest felt sore. He was hungry, but the idea of food—of a taco or a burger or anything—made his stomach turn. “Jesus,” Rudy said, startling him out of a daydream, “you’re like one of the walking dead. I mean, at that last place I couldn’t tell whether you were pushing the mower or the mower was pushing you.” The best Marciano could do was give him a tired grin. “What?” Rudy said, staring now. “Late night last night?”</p><p>Rudy was helping him lift the mower down from the back of the truck, so he couldn’t avoid his eyes. He just nodded.</p><p>“Youth,” Rudy said, shaking his head as they set the mower down in the driveway of a little mustard-colored house with a patch of lawn in front and back and a towering hedge all the way around that had to be clipped every other week, and this was that week, which meant hauling out the ladder, too. “I used to be like that, burn the candle at both ends, drink till they closed the bars and get up for work three hours later.” Rudy sighed. “But no more. Now I’m in bed before the ten-o’clock news—and Norma’s already snoring.”</p><p>Marciano had heard all this before, twenty times already, and he didn’t say anything, just leaned into the mower to push it up the driveway, but the mower didn’t seem to want to budge, and he felt weak all of a sudden, weak and sick, and here came the cough, right on cue. He really hacked this time, hacked till he doubled over and tears came to his eyes. When he straightened up, Rudy was watching him, and his smile was gone.</p><p>“That doesn’t sound too good,” he said. “You ever go to the clinic like I told you?”</p><p>“Yes,” he said. “Or, no, not really—”</p><p>“What do you mean, <em>not really</em>? You sound like your lungs are shot.”</p><p>He paused to catch his breath, because he couldn’t really cough and talk at the same time, could he? He lifted one hand and let it drop. “It’s just a cold,” he said, then turned and pushed the mower up the drive.</p><p>They were waiting for him when he got home, a cop in uniform and Rosa Hinojosa, who looked so fierce and grim she might have been wearing somebody else’s face. He’d run into her at the clinic the day before, and she’d asked him if he was sticking to the regimen, and he told her he was, and she flashed a smile so luminous it made him feel unmoored. “Good,” she said. “Good. Do it for me, O.K.?” But now here she was. He saw her before he saw the cop, the crisp line her skirt cut just above her knees, her pretty legs, the heels she wore to work, and for the briefest flash of a second he wondered what she was doing there, and then he saw the cop and he knew. Rudy had just dropped him off, was already pulling away from the curb, and Marciano wanted desperately to climb back into the pickup and go wherever Rudy would take him, but everything was in slow motion now, like in the outer-space movies where the astronauts are just floating there on their tethers and the ship slides away from them in a long smear of light and shadow.</p><p>He pulled a mask from his pocket—a dirty one, to show it had been used—looped it over his ears, and snapped it in place, as if that would make him look better in Rosa Hinojosa’s eyes, but her face showed only disappointment and something else, too: anger. He’d let her down. He’d had his warning, his final warning, and he’d been caught out, but how had she known? Had somebody informed on him? Some enemy he didn’t even know he had?</p><p>The cop, he could see at a glance, wasn’t a real cop, more some sort of Health Services mule, and he was old and slow and his head was like a big <em>calabaza</em> propped up on his shoulders, and Rosa Hinojosa, for all her youth, was no runner, not in those shoes. So he ran. Not like in the track meets at school when he was a boy, because his lungs were like wet clay, but still he put one foot in front of the other, hustling down the alley between his house and the one next door, to where the fence out back opened onto the dry streambed and the path through the weeds he sometimes used as a shortcut to the corner store. He got as far as the fence before he gave out, and, he had to admit, both Rosa Hinojosa and the <em>calabaza</em> head were quicker than he would have thought. He was just lying there, pathetic, humiliated in front of this woman he wanted to prove himself to, and he watched them pause to snap on their own masks before the cop bent to him and encircled his wrists with the handcuffs.</p><p>The next thing he saw was the hospital, a big clean white stucco<span data-page="page_5"></span> box of a building that had secondary boxes attached to it, a succession of them lined up like children’s blocks all the way out into the parking lot in back. He’d been here once before, to the emergency room, when he’d nearly severed the little finger of his left hand with the blade of the hedge trimmer, and they’d spoken Spanish to him, sewed and bandaged the wound and sent him on his way. That wasn’t how it was this time. This time he was wearing a mask, and so was Rosa Hinojosa and so was the mule, who kept guiding him down the corridors with a stiff forefinger till they went through a door and briefly out into the sunlight before entering an outbuilding that looked like one of the temporary classrooms you saw when you went by the high school. What was funny about it, or not so funny, was the way people made room for them in the corridors, shrinking into the walls as they passed by in their masks.</p><p>When he’d had a chance to take in the barred windows and the heavy steel door that pulled shut behind them with a whoosh of compression, Rosa Hinojosa, cold as a fish, explained to him that he was being remanded to custody as a threat to public safety under the provisions of the statutory code of the State of California, and that he would be confined here temporarily before he could be moved to the Men’s Colony, in the next county, which was equipped with a special ward for prisoners with medical conditions. He felt sick, sicker than ever, and what made it worse was that there was no smell to that room, which might as well have been on the moon. He saw a sterile white counter and a man in thick-framed glasses and some sort of hospital scrubs stationed behind it. Rosa Hinojosa was doing all the talking. She had a sheaf of papers in one hand and she turned away from him to lay them on the counter. There was a U.S. flag in the corner. A drinking fountain. Black and white tiles on the floor. “I didn’t do anything,” Marciano protested.</p><p>Rosa Hinojosa, who was conferring with the man behind the counter, gave him a sharp glance. “You were warned.”</p><p>“What do you mean? I took my medicine. You saw me—”</p><p>“Don’t even give me that. We have you on the feed from the security camera at the 7-Eleven making a purchase without your mask on—and there was testimony from the bartender at Herlihy’s that you were in there without a mask, <em>drinking</em>, on the very first day you walked out of the clinic.”</p><p>“I’m an American citizen.”</p><p>She shrugged.</p><p>“Look it up.” This was true. He’d been born in San Diego, two years old when his parents were deported, so he’d never had a chance to learn English or go to school here or anything else, but he had his rights, he knew that—they couldn’t just lock him up. That was against the Constitution.</p><p>Rosa Hinojosa had turned back to the counter, riffling through the stack of forms, but now she swung angrily around to him, a crease of irritation between her eyes. She wasn’t pretty anymore, not even remotely, and all he felt for her was hate, because, no matter what she said, when it came down to it she was part of the system, and the system was against him. “I don’t care if you’re the President,” she snapped. “We bent over backward, and now you’ve left us no choice. Don’t you understand? The order’s been signed.”</p><p>“I want a lawyer.”</p><p>He saw that she had a little dollop of flesh under her chin—she was already going to fat—and he realized that she was nothing to him, and, worse, that he was nothing to her but one more charity case, and what he did next was born of the sadness of that realization. He wasn’t a violent person, just the opposite—he was shy and he went out of his way to avoid confrontation. But they were the ones confronting him—Rosa Hinojosa and the whole Health Services Department, the big stupid-looking mule who’d clamped the handcuffs on him and made the mistake of removing them after they stepped through the door, and the man behind the desk, too. Marciano took as deep a breath as he could manage and felt the mucus rattling in his throat, the bad stuff he kept dredging up all day and spitting into a handkerchief until the handkerchief was stiff with it. What he was about to do was wrong, he knew that, and he regretted it the instant he saw it before him, but he wasn’t going to any prison, no way. That just wasn’t in the cards.</p><p>So now he was running again, only this time they weren’t chasing him, or not yet, because, mask or no mask, they were all three of them frantically trying to wipe his living death off their faces—and good, good, see how they like it, see how they like being condemned and ostracized and locked up without a trial or a lawyer or anything—and he didn’t stop spitting till he had the door open and was back out in the sunlight, dodging around the cars in the lot and heading for the street and the cover of<span data-page="page_6"></span> the trees there. His heart was pounding and his lungs felt as if they’d been turned inside out, but he kept going, slowing to a stiff-kneed walk now, down one street, then another, the windshields of the parked cars pooling in the light like puddles after a storm, birds chattering in the trees, the smell of the earth and the grass so intense it was intoxicating. He patted down his pockets: wallet, house key, the little vial of pills. And where was he going? What was he doing? He didn’t have any money—no more than maybe ten or fifteen dollars in his wallet—and there was nobody he could turn to, not really. There was Sergio, the only one of his housemates he was close to, and Sergio would loan him money, he was sure of it, but Sergio probably didn’t have much more than he did. The only thing for certain was that he couldn’t stay here anymore.</p><p>He hadn’t seen his mother in two years, hadn’t really given her a thought, but he thought of her now, saw her face as vividly as if she were that woman right there slipping into the front seat of her car. She’d nursed him through the measles, whooping cough, the flu, and whatever else had come along to disrupt his childhood, and why couldn’t she nurse him through this, too? She could, if he was careful and took his pills and wore the mask every single minute of every day, because he wouldn’t want to infect her—that would be the worst thing a son could do. No matter what the doctors said, his mother would save him, protect him, do anything for him. But how was he going to get to her? They’d be watching for him at the bus station and at the train depot and at the airport, too, even if he could scrape up enough for a ticket, which he couldn’t. . . . But what about Rudy? Maybe he could get Rudy to drive him as far as Tijuana—or, no, he’d tell Rudy he needed to borrow the truck to help one of his roommates move a refrigerator or a couch, and then he’d do the driving himself and get somebody to bring the truck back, pay somebody, make promises, whatever it took. That was a plan, wasn’t it? He had to have a plan. Without a plan he was lost.</p><p>He kept moving, breathing hard now, the sidewalk like a treadmill rolling under him, but he had to fight it, had to be quick because they’d have the cops after him in their patrol cars, an all-points bulletin like on TV, and they weren’t going to be gentle with him, either. Up ahead, at the end of the street, was a park he’d gone to once or twice with Sergio to drink beer and throw horseshoes, and there were bushes there, weren’t there, along the streambed. Pushing through the park gate—kids, mothers, swings, a couple of bums laid out on the grass as if they’d been installed there along with the green wooden benches—he tried to look casual, even as the sirens began to scream in the distance and he told himself it was only just ambulances bringing people to the emergency room. He went straight across the lawn, looking at nobody, and then he was in the bushes and out of sight and he dropped to the ground and just lay there until his heart stopped hammering and the burning in his lungs began to subside. It would be dark soon, and then he could make his way back to the house, borrow somebody’s phone, call Rudy, pack a few things, and be gone before anybody could do anything about it.</p><p>Paranoia was when you felt that everybody was after you even if they weren’t, but what would you call this? Common sense? They’d come to his house and handcuffed him and put him in that white room, and he hadn’t done anything. Now they’d charge him with escaping or resisting arrest or whatever they wanted to call it—and assault, too, assault with the deadly weapon that was his own spit. It didn’t matter. The result would be the same—thirty months in a sterile room with the fans sucking in and the warders wearing masks and gloves and pushing a tray of what passed for food through a slot in the door and coming in twice a day to stick the intravenous in him. He’d rather be dead. Rather be in Mexico. Rather take his chances with his mother and the clinic in Ensenada, where at least they spoke his language and wouldn’t look at him like he was a cockroach.</p><p>He was thirsty, crazy thirsty, but he forced himself to stay where he was till it was dark, then slipped back into the park to get a drink at the faucet in the rest room. Only problem was the door was locked. He stood there a long moment, rattling the doorknob, feeling disoriented. There was the steady hiss of cars from the freeway that was somewhere behind him in the intermediate distance. The trees were shrouds. The sky was black overhead and painted with stars, and it had never seemed so close. He could almost feel the weight of it, all the weight of the sky that went on and<span data-page="page_7"></span> on to infinity, outer space, the planets, the stars, pressing down on him till he could barely breathe. Desperate, he knelt in the grass and felt around till he located a sprinkler head. At first it wouldn’t budge, but he kept at it till the seal gave and he was able to unscrew it and put his mouth to the warm gurgling flow there, and that made him feel better and pushed the vagueness into another corner of his mind. After a while, he got to his feet, eased himself down into the streambed, and began working his way back in the direction of the house.</p><p>It wasn’t easy. What would have taken him ten minutes out on the street took an hour at least, his feet unsteady in a slurry of mud and trash, stiff dead reeds knifing at him, dogs barking, the drift of people’s voices freezing him in place. He was sweating, and shivering, too, and his shirt was torn at the right elbow, where he’d snagged it on something in the strange half-light of the gully.</p><p>He didn’t really know how far he’d gone or where he was when he emerged, scrambling up a steep incline and into the yard of a house that was mercifully dark. There were lights on in the houses on both sides of it, though, and the black humped shape of an automobile parked in the driveway. He moved toward the car and then past it, and if he was startled by a voice calling out behind him, a single syllable he would have recognized in any language—<em>Hey!</em>—he didn’t hesitate or turn around or even look over his shoulder but just kept going, down the driveway and straight across the street to the sidewalk on the far side, where he was only another pedestrian out for a stroll on a cool night in a quiet city.</p><p>When he got to his own street, he made himself slow down and scan the cars parked on both sides of the road, looking for anything suspicious, the police or the Health Services, Rosa Hinojosa, though that <em>was</em> being paranoid—Rosa Hinojosa would be at home with her parents at this hour, or her husband, if she had one, absorbed in her own life, not his. He took his time, though he was feeling worse by the minute, shivering so hard he had to wrap his arms around himself, his shirt soaked and too thin against the night and the temperature, which must have dropped into the mid-fifties by now. And then, steeling himself, he slipped across the street and into the dark yard of the rooming house, where they’d come for him once and would come for him again.</p><p>He ducked in the back door, tentative, all the blood in his brain now, screaming at him, but there was nobody in the hall, and in the next moment he was in his room, the familiar scent of his things—unwashed laundry, soap, shampoo, the foil-wrapped burrito he’d set aside to microwave for dinner—rising to his nostrils in the ordinary way, as if nothing had happened. The cough was right there waiting to erupt, but he fought it down, afraid even to make the slightest sound, and though he was tempted to turn the light on, he knew better—if anyone was out there, this was what they’d be watching for. He found his jacket thrown over the back of the chair where he’d left it that morning and wrapped himself in it, then went to the window and opened the blinds, so that six thin stripes of illumination fell across the bed. That was when he remembered his pills—he had to take his pills no matter where he was or what happened, that was the truth of his life, whether he ever saw Rosa Hinojosa again or not.</p><p>He went to the sink for a glass of water, shook out two of the little white pills and swallowed them. Then—and he couldn’t help himself—he lay down on the bed and closed his eyes, just for a minute.</p><p>The knock startled him out of a dreamless sleep, the knock at the front door that thundered through the house as if the wrecking ball had come to reduce it all to splinters. But who would knock? Everybody who lived here had a key, so there was no need for knocking, not unless you were immigration or the police. Or Health Services. For one fluttering instant, he pictured Rosa Hinojosa in police blues with a cap cocked over her eye, a nightstick in one hand and a can of Mace in the other, and then he was pulling his door softly shut and fastening the latch, as if that would save him—but what was he going to do, hide under the bed? He didn’t know much, but he knew they’d be at the back door, too, just like in the movies when they nailed the gangsters and the pimps and the drug lords and the whole audience stood up and cheered.</p><p>No time for his backpack, no time for clothes, his toothbrush, for the change he kept in a pickle jar in the top drawer, no time for anything but to jerk up the window in its creaking frame while the knocking at the front door rose to a relentless pounding and the voices started up, Sergio’s and somebody<span data-page="page_final"></span> else’s and a dog barking, and then he was down in the grass and scrambling, hunched over, for the next yard and then the next one after that. It took everything he had. Twice, he tripped in the dark, going down hard on somebody’s patio, all the little sounds of the neighborhood amplified now, every TV turned up full blast, motorcycles blaring like gunfire out on the street, even the crickets shrieking at him, and that dog, the ratcheting bark of that dog back at the house, a police dog, the kind of dog that never gave up, that could sniff you out even if you sprouted wings and flew up into the sky.</p><p>Where was he? Some dark place. Some citizen’s back yard with its jade plants and flower bed and patch of lawn. A cold hand was inside him, yanking at his lungs, squeezing and bunching and pulling the meat there up into his throat, so that he couldn’t breathe. He went down on his hands and knees, and there was no plan now but to find the darkest corner of the yard, the place where nobody had bothered to cut the grass or trim the shrubs, where the earth was real and present and he could let the blood come up and forget about the pills and Rosa Hinojosa and his mother and Rudy and everybody else.</p><p>Time leaped ahead. He was stretched out in the dirt. What was on his shirt was hot and secret and wet. He closed his eyes. And when he opened them again all he could see was the glint of a metal trap, bubbles rising in the clear cold water, and the hands of the animal fighting to get out. ♦</p>	T.

Miriam was forbidden to operate her parents’ hi-fi, built into a long rosewood cabinet that also included a radio, the most fantastical item of furniture in their lives, purchased on installment at Brown’s Appliance, on Greenpoint Avenue, and a fixture of contention in any number of speeches on the subject of what her father termed, in the grip of one of his baroque and finicky rages, their “slavery to commerce.” <em>And along come the gray goose</em>, <em>Lord</em>, <em>Lord</em>, <em>Lord</em>. Miriam had to request the Burl Ives each time.</p><p>The way her mother handled the album reminded Miriam of the Jewish ritual actions Rose despised: the slipping of scrolls from a cabinet, her grandfather’s tender sheathing of the afikomen within its napkin at Passover, really anytime Miriam had ever witnessed a Jew handling papers of importance or turning the pages of a book as if unworthy, grateful, ennobled, discreetly defiant, all at once. Rose opened her political books in this way—her Engels and Lenin and Earl Browder, her volumes of Carl Sandburg’s life of Abraham Lincoln. And she tutored Miriam in the action of handling an LP: middle fingers paired at the label, steadying thumb at the disk’s outer edge. Never so much as a breath grazing the sacred dark-glinting music carved into the disk’s canyons, during its passage in and out of the crisp inner papers. A wrong glance could probably scratch the thing. God knew this was a house of wrong glances.</p><p>For the girl seated at the record-player, fathoming the nature of her mother’s presence and her father’s absence was practically a full-time pursuit. If necessary, she’d offer it as justification for a report card’s testimony of mild disappointment: <em>Miriam</em>, <em>though talented and capable</em>, <em>seems distracted from her assignments</em>. Yes, she’d say. Too busy with my real study: the implausibility of my existence on earth! For what, after all, had Albert Zimmer and Rose Angrush’s marriage been if not an implausibility briefly entertained? Tolerated for an instant before being demolished, dismantled from at least three directions at once: her family, his family, and the Party. The high assimilated German joining up with Rose the Polack, Rose the Russian, Rose the immigrant, Rose the second-generation, raised-in-the-back-of-a-candy-store Brooklyn Jew? Unlike every comedy ever devised by Jewish writers mocking class difference from the sanctuary of Hollywood, these were divisions that truly <em>couldn</em>’<em>t</em> be overcome by the bonds of love. Rose and Albert’s marriage wasn’t <em>screwball;</em> it was <em>you’re screwed</em>. Not “It Happened One Night” but “It Happened Never.”</p><p>Miriam’s origin myth centered on Rose and Albert’s first meeting. Even after her father had fled back to Germany, she could get Rose to tell the story. What child wouldn’t start there? Grasp this story, and you might even know what kind of meeting you could expect to make in the world, at some future time.</p><p>It was at a packed hall near Gramercy Park, under a high ornate ceiling echoing with voices: there a mole met a mole. Rose seated on one side, in a creaky wooden folding chair, Albert seated across the room, in another. Both seeking to take the meeting’s floor, to steer its innocence and idealism in a given direction, both eager to run back to their contacts and brag of enlisting the group, and each obstructed, largely, by the other. Oh, it was ripe: Albert and Rose discovered each other because they’d been assigned, by their separate and poorly coördinated cells, to insinuate themselves into the same organization, the Gramercy Park Young People’s League. To introduce the possibility of solidarity with the coming workers’ revolution into this vague, well-intentioned gathering.</p><p>Each was therefore forced, at some point, to bite a tongue and hear the other. Until, as they tussled for dominance in pursuit of the same outcome, the prospect of some other form of tussle emerged in the thoughts of both, and the hall’s other occupants melted away into irrelevance. Albert thinking, Who is this young Emma Goldman, this zaftig Brooklyn shtetl girl in the hand-sewn dress, covering the Yiddish parts of her speech with elegant rhetoric, with comical double-feature-at-the-Loew’s Britishisms? Rose thinking, Who is this fair Germanic professorially handsome fellow in suspenders and gold-rimmed glasses—and can he possibly be, as he claims in his speech, Jewish?</p><p>Their infatuation was above all a meeting of two intellects gleaming with the same exalted certainties, two wills emboldened by the same great cause, and they were still uncovering the extent of their political sympathies (though “political” was too limited a term, insufficient to describe what joining the greatest movement of human history had done for their sense of what life itself was <em>for</em>), gabbing a mile a minute, barely able to stop talking to eat the food that sat cooling on the table where she’d cooked it for him in the kitchen of his flat, or to sip the wine they’d poured but in their intoxication with the cause hardly needed, when Albert first unbuttoned her dress and his trousers. So the tussle, begun in full public view, was now consummated behind closed doors.<span data-page="page_2"></span></p><p>For a little while, Rose and Albert abandoned all urgencies, except those of a cell of two. Two fronts moving as one. Full synthesis achieved and lost on a nightly basis.</p><p>Then, when Rose had missed three menstruations, they married. What could be so wrong? They were two Jews. Two humans. Two believers in revolution. In the eyes of anyone but their families, a matched pair. Any “real American” would have heard his German accent as close kin if not identical to her parents’ Yiddish. He was fair and she was dark, sure. But, spiritually, they could be taken for brother and sister. Certainly Albert and Rose found themselves allied utterly, proudly so, in the glance of any hater of Jews or revolutionists. Wouldn’t the Cause soon erase all distinctions of class and creed and race?</p><p>Try telling it to the Jews. At their futzed-together, hasty wedding, Albert’s mother and her brother high-hatted the Angrush clan—that whole spilling array of Rose’s sisters and their husbands and their broods, the innumerable cousins. They treated Rose’s family like the servants they’d been forced to let go just before fleeing Lübeck. The Zimmers, the progressive, the enlightened, the worldly Zimmers, in the face of non-German Jews, semi-religious Jews, village Jews, felt their own place instantly: <em>above</em> them. This union was not what world revolution was meant to make possible, thank you very much!</p><p>Then, as if to prove that the cosmos itself wanted no such union, the pregnancy lapsed, in the privacy of night, leaking out of Rose in gobs and streams, so discreetly that she was left to explain it to Albert herself, just weeks after the wedding.</p><p>Now, girl, the doctor said, eat red meat and salad, avoid exotic fruits such as bananas, and try again. Try again? They hadn’t been trying. He’d meant to pull out. Now, married, they’d try.</p><p>By now they’d settled, out of Manhattan, but not out of the heart of the world’s happy controversies: no. They’d made their home in the official Socialist Utopian Village of the outer boroughs, Sunnyside Gardens, where the houses bounded courtyard gardens, the neighbors venting their lives one to another across a shared common. Yet with such struggles as soon overtook Rose and Albert, truthfully, they might have wished to be a little better partitioned from their neighbors’ overhearing. That first accord between them, had it been only a fever of hormones? Their marriage only a panic of pregnancy in the wake of brain-befogging stints of sheer fucking?</p><p>A baby would make it right.</p><p>They tried and tried. Four years of trying before his seed would take in her again and make Miriam. The girl arrived just in time to be assigned her own booklet of wartime ration stamps, born into a new world that no longer resembled the nascent utopia in which Rose and Albert had come together to start a family.</p><p>The marriage was by that time wrecked—on reefs of personality, on the lack of support from the two alienated families, and on Albert’s vanity, his uselessness at the task of anything but distant and unreachable revolutions. Rose worked as a bookkeeper in a pickle factory, toiling alongside the workingman. Albert was either above or beneath mere work: give him even a sheaf of pamphlets to distribute, and you’d find them stuffed into his suit’s pockets, his campaign to distribute them among the working classes having ended in some dialectical flirtation over drinks with a fellow-pamphleteer he just happened to run into. And then, soon enough, he was gone.</p><p>By 1948, the top men in New York Communism had taken notice of Albert and decided that he needed correction, needed to be adjusted, from the status of dissolute husband and father, and pressed into service overseas. He was returned to Germany, where his courtly manners made him an asset instead of a sore thumb. Now Rose was a reverse war widow, divorced from but still married to the sole Jew who’d run back to Germany, run back because he wanted to dissolve his urbanity, his Jewishness, his Americanness, all in the solvent of the Soviet.</p><p>Men got through the Sunnyside Gardens door after Albert. Handsome, heavy of chest, Rose was seen by men and didn’t always flinch from being seen. Yet none of them ever meant anything to her. Apart from Lincoln, that is. For Rose had erected a shrine on the half-circle table in the apartment’s foyer, on which the six volumes of Sandburg’s “Lincoln” were aligned, and in front of them a small cameo portrait of the martyred President was propped. Albert moved out and Lincoln moved in. For any other man, an hour in Rose’s bed but not so much as a cup of coffee afterward. Let alone permission to stay the night. In the apartment, only Rose, Lincoln, and Miriam, the daughter who was repository for Rose’s whole self, her insurance against being forgotten.</p><p>H_e was six weeks a-fallin_’, <em>Lord</em>, <em>Lord</em>, <em>Lord</em> / <em>And they had a feather-pickin</em>’, <em>Lord</em>, <em>Lord</em>, <em>Lord</em>. For what seemed a year of life as her father’s letters—not many of them—came from Rostock, from Leipzig, locations, thanks to <em>Life</em> magazine, impossible to envision except as wholly deserving ruins, palaces of rubble, Miriam sat entranced or bored, stilled anyhow, mulling what Ives seemed to have to impart, cheery parables of ducks and whales and goats and geese. Once, Sol Eaglin, making<span data-page="page_3"></span> one of his mysterious visits—dapper, bullshitting Comrade Sol—stopped in the living room to jape at Miriam and her album.</p><p>“What’s your kid know from ducks, Rose? You ever been to a farm, doll?”</p><p>“She knows from ducks,” Rose said. “She’s been to a Chinese restaurant.”</p><p>Animals, in Rose’s remorselessly unsentimental urban pragmatist’s views, were for eating, sure. (No filthy pets for Miriam.) Rose frowned at children’s books when they veered in directions zoological or anthropomorphic to any extent beyond Aesop, with his adamantine morals. (Always, with Rose, special emphasis on the bitterness of grapes, the inaccessibility of tidbits residing at the bottom of a vase: animals starved, animals rationalized, animals connived.) Sentimentalizing a duckling or a rabbit was associated, for Miriam, with her mother’s contempt for Catholic ritual: Easter eggs, bland milk-chocolate bunnies (“Only German chocolate is worth eating,” Rose would say, in irony and sorrow, then follow with her regular sighing incantation: “They made the very best of everything, of <em>everything</em>”), smears of ash, idiot Irish and Italian neighbors under the knuckle of idiot priests. So what was the anomalous gray goose, who wouldn’t be made a meal of, meant to signify? <em>He was nine months a-cookin</em>’, <em>Lord</em>, <em>Lord</em>, <em>Lord</em> / <em>Then they put him on the table</em>, <em>Lord</em>, <em>Lord</em>, <em>Lord</em> / <em>And the knife couldn</em>’<em>t cut</em> ’<em>im</em>, <em>Lord</em>, <em>Lord</em>, <em>Lord</em> / <em>And the fork couldn’t stick</em> ’<em>im</em>, <em>Lord</em>, <em>Lord</em>, <em>Lord</em>. Where was Aesop when you needed him? Of all the songs on the album, this was the one Miriam studied, helplessly. <em>So they took him to the sawmill</em>, <em>Lord</em>, <em>Lord</em>, <em>Lord</em> / <em>Oh</em>, <em>it broke the saw</em>’<em>s tooth out</em>, <em>Lord</em>, <em>Lord</em>, <em>Lord</em>. At last, one day, Rose took mercy on her daughter and explained. The answer, when it came, wasn’t difficult, though Miriam, at six, could never have guessed it.</p><p>Now, tonight, more than a decade later, on the postage-stamp-size platform in a Greenwich Village club so small that any table was front and also rear, the grapevines of smoke clinging to the ceiling providing an illusion of distance in a room that, cleared of bentwood chairs and voices and clamor and filth, would have been revealed as no larger than the Sunnyside Gardens parlor where Miriam had memorized her mother’s albums, yet which somehow made room for not only a stage and a side bar featuring Italian coffee and red wine but also for an intricate social world that Miriam was just learning to parse—here the tenor folksinger on the tiny platform crooned out exactly Burl Ives’s version of the folk song. Note for note, vocal gesture for vocal gesture, syllable for syllable. <em>The last time I see</em>’<em>d him</em>, <em>Lord</em>, <em>Lord</em>, <em>Lord</em> / <em>He was flyin</em>’ <em>over the ocean</em>, <em>Lord</em>, <em>Lord</em>, <em>Lord</em> / <em>With a long string of goslins</em>, <em>Lord</em>, <em>Lord</em>, <em>Lord</em>. The raffish blond singer offered up a version cribbed from a children’s LP, as if it had been dredged out of some mossy Appalachian music-finding expedition, or salvaged during some hobo’s stint working in a train yard or begging at the kitchen door of the very farm that had raised the gray goose itself. Miriam laughed at how smugly the rendition was gobbled up by those unqualified to know the difference—or who if they knew it would endure fingernail splinters before confessing that they were familiar with Ives’s version. The boy at her side turned, as he had each time that night she’d laughed for no evident cause, and said, “What?”</p><p>“Nothing.” All this she couldn’t explain, not to him. (Afterward, it would be his name, among so many here, that she, famous rememberer, resolutely couldn’t dredge up.) Then Miriam laughed again and said, “Do you know what the gray goose represents?”</p><p>“Eh?”</p><p>“I’m asking what the gray goose represents. I just wondered if you knew.”</p><p>The song now finished, she’d gained the attention of their whole table, and the table beside theirs as well. Chairs, long since reversed so that chests creased against chair backs, cigarette-knuckled hands flung carelessly forward for ballast, now squeaked. The margin between different tables, between friends and strangers, those who’d arrived in one configuration and those who might later depart rearranged, in pairs or complicated threes or gaggles or alone, had been lost a while ago.</p><p>“Enlighten us, Mim,” said Porter, the clever one in horn-rims, the Columbia man. Eying her for several nights now but too genteel to pry her from the boy.</p><p>“Well, since you ask, the gray goose represents the irrevocable destiny of the working class.” Never had Miriam been so delighted to regurgitate a Roseism.</p><p>Leaning in from the next table like a Disney wolf, Rye Gogan said, “Ach, fella, beware—your girl’s a Red.” Rye, middle baritone of the Gogan Boys, an act too big for this stage (not only reputation-wise but in strict bodily terms, the three Irish louts in their thick brocaded vests would never have fit on this club’s riser), was the celebrity among them, not that any of them would acknowledge it. Rye Gogan was also already famous as something worse than a wolf. A drunken shark at an evening’s end. The girl farthest from shore at that point was traditionally doomed. “No, really, she is one,” Porter said. “Not like us paper revolutionaries, gentlemen. Mim grew up in a <em>cell</em>, she’s been to <em>secret meetings</em>. Tell them, Mim.”</p><p>“Meetings?” Rye growled. “Who hasn’t?” The Irish<span data-page="page_4"></span> singer rounded his shoulders, that signature vest like a dank filthy sail hung from the rigging of his chest, and creaked his chair back toward his own party. Likely registering that engaging with Miriam’s table entailed simply too much smarty-pants confusion to be worth the bother now, even if he’d tabulated Miriam’s presence for some pending shark chase to shore.</p><p>“You have no idea,” Miriam said to Porter, and Porter’s friend, named, she was fairly certain, Adam, and the Barnard girl Adam had brought along, who’d said she was from Connecticut, and who’d been looking sick for most of an hour already. “I have a pedigree. My father’s a German spy.”</p><p>“Can he get us into Norman Mailer’s party?” Adam said. Adam knew, or pretended to know, where the real action was tonight. Any crowded smoky basement or throngs on MacDougal or St. Marks to the contrary, all persons visible to their gaze were, ipso facto, losers like themselves.</p><p>“He’s not allowed into the United States,” Miriam said, surprising herself with where this was going, but then seeing it play, like nearly anything from her mouth, in this company: thrilled amazement at what the wild child from Sunnyside might say next. Her fiercest sincerities were translated by the male ego, on arrival, into daffy flirtation. For instance, when Miriam said she was bored by jazz (worshipping at its longueurs, its brilliant “passages,” induced the same claustrophobia she always felt at sitting hushed through Rose’s Beethoven symphonies, being instructed in their remorseless dire profundities) and preferred Elvis Presley (cutting class to hide in Lorna Himmelfarb’s basement, listening to Presley having been the sole salvation in the final semester of her senior year at Sunnyside High), men like Porter went into paroxysms of delight at how the female could want to provoke them, never grasping the notion that anyone they’d ever be seen squiring, let alone this raven-haired Jewess with a vocabulary like Lionel Trilling’s, could possibly possess such backward tastes. No one who actually didn’t get jazz would ever admit it! And if you got it, man, well, you got it. Miriam, therefore, was a tease, ironist supreme. And with a figure.</p><p>“She’s dead serious,” Porter said now, fingering his frames Arthur Miller style, again sealing Miriam’s words with his only-I-get-it endorsement.</p><p>Miriam’s original boy had been morosely toying with the red wax pooling in their table’s blunt candle, dipping his fingertips to coat them, then jostling the little inverted fingerprints off to assemble, like a series of mouse-size bowls on the tablecloth, or tiny bloody footprints, a mock crime scene. Maybe trying to say that someone had placed a tiny dagger in his tiny heart. Truly, Rye Gogan’s storm-cloud attentions had altered the barometric pressure at their table. While the folksinger interred his guitar to the mildest applause, a poet or comedian, some Lenny Bruce aspirant, stood waiting to commandeer the unnecessary microphone. He wore a cravat and clutched a sheaf of papers. Someone knew him. But someone knew everyone. Miriam believed she could get one or more of her admirers on their feet and outside, possibly even Porter among them, and suddenly wanted to prove that she could.</p><p>“What the hey. I’ll get us into Mailer’s party.”</p><p>“How?”</p><p>“With my secret Commie powers, of course.”</p><p>An hour later they stood braving a cold wind at the gentle summit of the Brooklyn Bridge’s rotting-plank walkway, the East River’s boardwalk, and surveyed the transistor gleamings of the island they’d exited, contrasting it with the low-roofed smolder of Brooklyn Heights, the murk of their promised destination, <em>Mailer</em>’<em>s party</em>, down there somewhere, one of those faint flares amid a hundred thousand darkened bedrooms, the sea of sleepers beyond. Here they halted, stared. Boroughphobia. Fear of Brooklyn. Miriam recognized it in her companions and laughed, but silently, not wanting to incite her unmemorable boy to another automatic, threatened “<em>What</em>?”</p><p>Miriam felt it in them, this cohort she’d manufactured by calling them out of the folk basement: their collective reservations at being dragged to this brink, the bridge’s perihelion, the immigrant shores. For the moment, at least, this seventeen-year-old Queens College freshman dropout had called their bluff. The Barnard girl, Adam’s date; Adam himself; and solo, enchanted Porter, interested but too sweet to be predatory; and Miriam’s grown-sullen date, too. Miriam’s ad-hoc committee, <em>her</em> cell.</p><p>So forget Rose’s secret meetings, her living rooms, her smoky kitchens. Forget Rose’s sidewalk speeches, her tirades against the residents of the dead utopia of Sunnyside Gardens, corrupted by the onrush of coming disappointment, seeking scapegoats for their stupid guilt at their wasted lives. This night, right here, with New York splayed before them, a banquet they feared to eat, Miriam understood clearly for the first time that her Secret Commie Powers were not actually a joke: Miriam Zimmer understood tonight she was a <em>leader of men</em>. Not just men slavering over her curves or astonished at her wit or haunted by her Jewish mysteries or dazzled by her fluency with the city’s mad systems—the subway lines, the Staten Island ferry terminal and its pigeon population, the significance of a Dave’s egg cream on Canal Street, the parsing of baseball affiliation since the Dodgers and the Giants had fled to California (no, you couldn’t just suddenly become a Yankee fan, not while Sandy Koufax and Jake Pitler still lived), her ease with Negroes, her allusions to veiled knowledge, the<span data-page="page_5"></span> transparency to her of symbols like the gray goose—but all of it, all. Surviving Rose and Sunnyside Gardens, that suburb of disappointment, had made Miriam sublime, a representative of the League of Absconded Kings or Queens. And, seeing it, she laughed aloud, and of course Forgettable weighed in with “What?”</p><p>“Listen.” Miriam’s favorite idiot bar bet gained a new allure here as they shivered on the bridge. The answer would be staring them in the face and they’d still blow it. “I’ll bet anyone here five bucks they can’t name an island in New York State that has a bigger population than forty-eight of the fifty states.”</p><p>“That’s dopey,” Adam said. “Manhattan, of course.”</p><p>“<em>You</em>’<em>re</em> dopey. It’s Long Island. You owe me five bucks or your last cigarette.”</p><p>“But, hey, who’s counting?” Porter said, leaning in with his own still plentiful pack, tapping a cluster of cigs halfway out. Fingers mobbed in, and then for an instant the five smokers were melded in physical purpose, clustering to bell-jar Porter’s match from the night’s wind, each dipping a cigarette’s tip to the flame. Ladies first, then, once the match was inevitably doused, finishing with the square dance of touching lit to unlit tips. Night workers edged in darkness past them, heads bent, ignorant of the city’s splendor and misery, filing toward sour bedrooms. Fear of Brooklyn: there was plenty to fear, Miriam knew, though not what her companions imagined.</p><p>“I’m freezing,” Forgettable said, evidently intending them to understand him to mean <em>frozen out</em>. Miriam’s date had given up petitioning with his shoulders and elbows to clutch Miriam to him, as Adam and his Barnard girl were clutched, the girl’s shoulder inside Adam’s tweed jacket, her arm vanished within his shirt at the waist. Forgettable’s last few attempts had been despondent anyhow, as though he sensed the turn things were taking. For Miriam was changing hands tonight, Porter sweeping her away, if something so completely under Miriam’s agency could be granted to Porter’s. It surely would be. Miriam being just a girl, after all. Miriam plunged her cigarette’s orange tip into the night. “Charge!”</p><p>“Screw Mailer,” her former date said. As if that were an option, in lieu of what he’d never get from Miriam. “I’ve got to get up in the morning. I’m going back.”</p><p>“We’ll walk you,” Adam said. This sudden defection sealed Miriam’s transfer more absolutely than she might have wished; after a flurry of embraces, she and Porter hoofed it down the Brooklyn slope of the bridge, just the two of them, while the others retreated to Manhattan. Miriam considered him entirely for the first time, her new courtier: with his funny knobbly gait, embarrassed or melancholic shoulders, and gigantic forehead, Porter was really drawn along Arthur Miller or Robert Lowell lines, though with his labored quipping he might be trying to pass as Mort Sahl. Leery Rose, in the right mood, might give him a chance on the basis of a resemblance to Abraham Lincoln. But then why would Miriam need her mother’s approval? She cancelled the thought.</p><p>“Look,” she said, again pointing her cigarette past the bridge’s descent into Brooklyn Heights. “Remsen Street, it’s one of those, terminating at the Promenade.” In her imagining, the glamorous town houses would be visible, a crest of terraces peering back across the water at Manhattan, and one of them declaring itself by throbbing with jazz and cocktail clatter, clouds of marijuana smoke, genius conversation. In truth, all that was visible there was a dark barricade of greenery, seemingly more than a mile beyond and below them, across the silent river’s mouth.</p><p>“Which?” Now, committed, Porter sounded nervous.</p><p>“It’ll be obvious from the street. We’ll hear it a block away, I expect.”</p><p>“If not, it isn’t worth going,” he bluffed, regaining his confidence. Yet that very bluff carried them merely a stride or two more on the bridge’s downward slope. Porter’s confidence had some other purpose, now that they’d shed their companions. Only when you’d finally shaken them free, those couple-disguising little mobs, the self-chaperoning cocoons that blobbed around everywhere together, were you reminded of their uses. Porter kissed her. Miriam kissed him back, just as ravenous, even if strategizing how to delay or undo it, or where they would go, or what it would have to mean. Porter’s cold fingertips had already found gaps in the buttons of her dress at her tailbone, causing some electrical outline to quiver along the contour of her buttocks, to her feet, which attempted to stay rooted on the walkway’s planks. Porter was tall. Miriam got up on her toes, a half-measure, a compromise with an impulse to drop in a swoon to her knees or lift off into the sky.</p><p>Precisely to the same degree that she’d been mothered in disappointment, in embittered moderation, in the stifling of unreasonable expectations, in second-generation cynicism toward collapsed gleaming visions of the future, the morose detachment of the suburbs, Miriam was in fact a Bolshevik of the five senses. Her whole body demanded revolution, her whole character screamed to see high towers raised up and destroyed. Every yearning Rose might ever have wished to dampen had been doubly instilled in her daughter. For all her quashing of utopias, Rose had merely been proving Miriam’s innate suspicion that life was elsewhere. For God’s sake, you could see the Empire State Building framed at the foot<span data-page="page_6"></span> of Greenpoint Avenue! And, for what felt like ten years, Miriam had been observing the special appearance and attitudes of the girls who had enrolled at City College but still lived at home, or at least kept rooms in their homes, in Sunnyside Gardens: the knowledge behind their new cat sunglasses, the cigarettes they sneaked and the gossip they ceased to spout on the communal back patios when nine- or ten- or twelve-year-old Miriam wandered up. Miriam knew that these girls were telling her <em>her</em> future and wondered why they bothered to conceal it. Miriam could see the Empire State Building now, past Porter’s shoulder as she pulled her mouth from his and leaned and gasped for air and stalled for time, her cheek against his arm. The stupid beckoning phallic symbol, brazenly named for the nation’s criminal aspirations yet paradoxically bearing with it the pride Rose had instilled in Miriam for being an <em>American</em> and a <em>New Yorker</em>, the dull amazing monument was always there, stabbing the air, calling to her, crushing her like a bug in advance. You’re nobody so special, Miriam Zimmer!</p><p>Except here on the bridge, upper lip already raw in the high wind from Porter’s five-o’clock shadow’s scraping, Miriam felt all the freedom accorded to <em>nobody special</em> as a power equal to the Empire State’s mass and force. Had anyone ever already known what Miriam knew at seventeen? It seemed unlikely. And tonight she would know more. She was going to let Porter be the first to make love to her, because he was just special and not-special enough to be the one to do it. <em>That night beginning on the bridge</em>, as she’d already half started to call it. “Take me somewhere,” she said.</p><p>There, with her words, to which Porter panted his grateful consent, began the insane night that had already had so many beginnings. First, withdrawal to Manhattan, not boroughphobia now but total uninterest in Mailer or the dark roofs or the cold sky or anything outside of themselves and their skins. If they could have left their clothing on the bridge, they might have done that. The I.R.T. at Brooklyn Bridge took them to Union Square, where in a high-backed booth in the Cedar Tavern they fondled and entwined tongues until asked to leave. They repeated the performance at the Limelight coffee shop, to which Miriam had dragged Porter after he’d expressed a dazed uncertainty as to where else to try—they’d have had more privacy in a corner of Mailer’s party, which she’d fully visualized by now as consisting of sultry Bennington girls being serially deflowered in piles of coats. They briefly had more privacy in Washington Square, where for another turbulent session they settled on a bench. But whenever they quit walking, and Porter’s hands resumed inching inside her already flimsy coverings, Miriam started to freeze. “Why can’t we go to your rooms?” she whispered.</p><p>Porter looked at her, not for the first time, with an admiration suggesting that Miriam was Wuthering Heights mad. “There’s a strict dorm policy.”</p><p>“I thought you Columbia men were trying to change that.”</p><p>“Trilling stood against us,” Porter bragged, proud anytime he could cite that name. “He seemed confused that we’d even <em>want</em> women in the dorms, leaving their nylons around, as he put it—”</p><p>“So why don’t you make a stand?” Miriam shamelessly gave this the Marilyn Monroe treatment, lips at his ear. “Protest for your cause.”</p><p>“My roommate,” Porter said helplessly. “I couldn’t—”</p><p>The virginity Miriam trailed around with her was an anchor, one she vowed to cast off before dawn. So they rode the subway again, to Grand Central, and she guided him downstairs to the track where the 7 line would carry them to Queens, then to the back of the platform. Miraculously, a train hovered, panting slightly with its doors open. They boarded and it took off as if it had been waiting for them. “After the river the train goes elevated, Porter. I’ll show you something you’ve never seen before.”</p><p>“What’s that?” he said dreamily. They’d walked with their fingers enlaced, pulling downward to draw each other close, his hip at her waist, her breasts at his ribs, each awkward rubbing step a kind of prolongation of the endless makeout session the night had become. On the train, they stood against a door, unwilling to discontinue the contact between the lengths of their bodies, letting the car’s lurches buckle his knee into a place between her legs.</p><p>“You’ll see. The greatest curve in the system,” Miriam teased.</p><p>“I actually think I know what you’re talking about.”</p><p>“That’s when you can be certain you’re wrong.”</p><p>“Nothing you could show me that was curved could be wrong.” What was this talk, so stupidly enchanted, so seemingly drunk on each other’s wit and promise? Or should the question be: How much red wine had she unthinkingly guzzled at the Cedar Tavern?</p><p>The Queens-bound train scraped moonward out of the darkness, into the constellation of streetlights and signage along Jackson Avenue. “Holy heck!” Porter shouted. “It’s like a roller coaster!”</p><p>“No, I told you,” she said, styling her formulation after Porter’s manner, and leaning into his ear to put it over, above the elevated’s rattle and shriek. “That was nothing, brace yourself. The real curve’s the next one, watch.” She urged him against the door’s windows, to take<span data-page="page_7"></span> it in fully. The 7’s lead cars obligingly jackknifed into Queensboro Plaza. “It’s the only place in the system where you can watch the front cars <em>of the train you’re on</em> pull into a station from the rear cars,” Miriam said. Hammering the point home, she felt like Rose. Like she’d picked up Rose’s hammer of personality to impress the Columbia boy, to bonk against his broad, pretentiously daft forehead. (How could you go to so much trouble to arrive in New York City, as the throngs at Columbia and Barnard had, and not ride the <em>system</em>?) As if Miriam’s life-exuberance pointed back toward Rose’s punitive ferocity, just the way the I.R.T. screamed in the direction of home.</p><p>She tried to see Sunnyside’s Forty-seventh Street through his eyes. The slumbering apartment blocks, the tended shrubbery and flagstone walks, Miriam’s home borough some false vision of calm, an immigrant’s dull fantasy of American sanctuary that suddenly turned her stomach; she hurried him past. Only they had exited the train at the Bliss Street station, and now, on the sidewalks, they passed no one. The whole journey might have been a dream she’d had, once she’d tiptoed inside through the Gardens and the kitchen door, and swept Porter into her bedroom, only he was still blithering about the elevated’s rocket ride, so that she had to hush him until her door was safely shut. She stuffed a towel along the jamb as if to enjoy a secret cigarette.</p><p>At this point, the dream of night—or morning, she’d glanced at Porter’s wristwatch on the street and the time was 3 <em class="small">A.M.</em>—veered toward squalid comedy. The two of them remaining on their feet, in some shyness still unwilling to commit to her bed, Porter struggling with one or another of her fasteners and buttons, forcing Miriam to add her hands to his and solve whatever problem he’d been muttering over, so that before very long she was completely nude while he still wore his entire outfit. In exasperation she lay down on the bedspread. “Take off your shoes, at least,” she whispered.</p><p>“Have you got an, um, pessary?”</p><p>“Pessary?” She tried not to snort at the absurd term, which struck her as Midwestern, if not actually Victorian. “Do you mean a diaphragm?” What, was he afraid to remove his clothes for fear of pregnancy? Should she lie? Yes. “Yes.”</p><p>“You do?”</p><p>“It’s taken care of, Porter.”</p><p>Miriam flashed on Rye Gogan and his reputation. Where was the masculine devourer when you needed him? Must you swim with sharks to get sharked? Take me, she wanted to tell Porter, yet refused to have to tell him, on the principle that even men in tortoiseshell glasses were meant to transform into animals in the dark. Perhaps especially men in tortoiseshell glasses, according to the cartoons in <em>Playboy</em>, Lorna Himmelfarb’s older brother’s copies of which she’d perused during Elvis-auditing sessions in the Himmelfarb basement. Something should be swarming Miriam, apart from her yearning to be swarmed. She got Porter onto the bed. Pulled him by the belt. Unzipped and researched inside. Oh, Lord, the boy, nicely long and rigid, Chinese-finger-trapped by desire in his too-tight boxer shorts, wasn’t circumcised. He also blurted his goop into her palm at the same instant that she groped the knob and discovered its stretchy hood. Then, sighing, Porter covered her lips and chin and nose with a flurry of seeking kisses, as if both grateful and falsifying the record. <em>See</em>, <em>I</em>’<em>m ravishing you</em>, <em>therefore I must have been all along!</em> Instead, she’d accidentally ravished him.</p><p>And it was at that moment that Rose came barrelling in, a titan, Alice’s enraged Red Queen in her quilted robe, her gossamer nightdress beneath it, her expression a storm of reproach, and the story abruptly had nothing to do with their bodies, with Miriam’s nakedness and desire and what Porter was or wasn’t going to do about it. All that was left of that story was how fortunate Miriam could feel, in retrospect, that she’d got so little of Porter’s clothing off. Even knowing that Rose had seen nothing, Miriam had time for the stray, absurd thought: Abraham Lincoln wouldn’t have been circumcised, either, so Rose couldn’t object to that, could she?</p><p>“Should I call the police?”</p><p>“No, Mother.”</p><p>“<em>No Mother</em> what?” Rose seized any occasion for a mental test, a verbal duel—why miss what was there for the taking?</p><p>“Don’t overreact, Rose, for God’s sake.”</p><p>The room flooded with light from the living room and foyer behind Rose, every lamp switched on, as though her mother had been awake for a duration of eavesdropping and pacing, and for expert selection of the awkwardest instant to make this confrontation.</p><p>“Don’t tell me how I should react. Don’t tell me what to do. If I don’t call the police it’s less a mercy than the fear they might arrest me for parental dereliction.” Rose’s bold, rising, theatrically superb declaration ran over a thin, husky, stuttering sound, something that might have been an attempt on Porter’s part to apologize or introduce himself or both, even as he juggled his glasses back onto his face and pinched at his zipper and his disordered trousers. Rose detoured to a Barbara Stanwyckian quip: “By the way, it’s rape, Mister, unless you happen still to be in high school yourself.”</p><p>“Nobody was <em>raped</em>,” Miriam said, letting her disappointment color<span data-page="page_8"></span> the word with scorn for Rose and Porter both. “And I’m not in high school, thank you.”</p><p>“You ought to be. This matter of skipping a grade makes you think you’re a woman now? The bosom on you fooled this young man, fair enough, but how can it have fooled you as well? Perhaps you’re ready to become parents of a child. It’s not as much pleasure as you’d think from the way it begins, making babies.”</p><p>“Nobody’s making any babies.” Miriam thought of the word “pessary” again. As long as Porter was present, this scene was only comic overture to the crisis, the explosion struggling to begin.</p><p>“I tried to raise a young woman but apparently produced an American teen-ager in her place. No doubt the fault is mine, yet it’s also the case that the result was sabotaged in a thousand ways. First by the father, who couldn’t be kept at home. In that, of course, the fault is surely mine. We fought terribly. I couldn’t keep him fascinated in ways a freethinker like you appears to have already mastered, but what two lovebirds like you couldn’t imagine is the world I brought this girl into. A battlefield. Not a playground for children in the bodies of adults. You’re in a hurry to grow up—we gave up our childhoods before we knew we’d given them up. Before I plunged my arms into pickle brine, I slaved in the back of that candy shop. This one, Miriam, ah! Look at the expression! He wouldn’t know what a barrel of halvah was if I shoved it in his face.”</p><p><em>Halvah!</em> Miriam found herself issuing a sharp guffaw.</p><p>“How could you,” Rose cried at Miriam’s laughter. “If I was dying it wouldn’t stop you doing as you wished. No doubt you’d step over my body on your way to Greenwich Village or to a man like this one, whose name you won’t even condescend to share with me. Step over my dying body on your voyage to where the squares wouldn’t go. But I hardly imagined you’d shower me with laughter as you went past.”</p><p>“You’re not dying, Rose.”</p><p>“I am inside.”</p><p><em>That</em>’<em>s how you know you</em>’<em>re still alive</em>, Miriam wanted to tell her. Dying inside was for Rose a way of life. Within her mother was a volcano of death. Rose had spent her whole life stoking it, trying to keep the mess contained but fuming. In Rose’s lava of disappointment, the ideals of American Communism had gone to die their slow death eternally; Rose would never die precisely because she needed to live forever, a flesh monument, commemorating socialism’s failure as an intimate wound.</p><p>Miriam started humming, the song entering her mind unbidden. <em>Last Sunday morning</em>, <em>Lord</em>, <em>Lord</em>, <em>Lord</em>. <em>Oh my daddy went a-huntin</em>’, <em>Lord</em>, <em>Lord</em>, <em>Lord</em>. It had been a trick question, she realized now, a paradox beyond even Aesop’s devising. How could you possibly learn the identity of the gray goose by asking the gray goose? For, after everything, this was at last unmistakable: the gray goose—inedible, adamantine, undead, warping any implement that dared glance in its direction, let alone one that dared to attack—was none other than Rose Zimmer.</p><p>Oh, an intervention was desperately needed, but the difficulty was in how little offense Porter gave, how few grounds for ejection. He stood dopily awaiting his turn, which would never come. Miriam now wished Porter would make some move, any move, even in panic, to incite Rose into showing him the door. Instead, Rose, measuring his passivity, latched on to a listener. Miriam couldn’t count how many she’d seen frozen on a square of sidewalk at one of Rose’s stunning harangues, though she’d never been draped naked in a sheet while a would-be boyfriend played the part. Maybe Porter was about to begin taking notes, as if at Trilling’s own feet. Miriam had to do everything herself. She elevated from the bed like a ghost or a muse in her drapery and took Porter’s elbow and guided him past a momentarily jaw-frozen Rose, back through the kitchen. Though Porter was apparently properly dressed, he moved as awkwardly as if he wore his jacket backward, his shoes on his hands.</p><p>“Go.”</p><p>“I’m so sorry. When can I—?”</p><p><em>When can I what</em>? Miriam thought, an exact Rose Angrush Zimmer cadence, except Rose would have said it aloud. What in this performance was Porter eager to reflect on or repeat? She craned on tiptoe for a quick kiss, surprising herself by wanting one. She’d after all fondled Porter’s secret heartbeat, collected his private sigh. They had, after all, been romancing across a connect-the-dot map of Miriam’s city for hours past, hours of what now seemed another night, another life entirely.</p><p>The light in the Gardens was morning light as Miriam stood at the kitchen door in a sheet, pushing her Columbia boy through the gap. Porter, she realized, could be from Mars for all he grasped of the creature with whom he’d passed the night. Miriam might be altering herself at a furious rate into that other thing, the girl Porter believed he’d deviously squired out of the basement club behind the stalking horse of her official date, then halfway across the Brooklyn Bridge and back, then to Queens to find himself more or less raped and accused of rape within a span of minutes, but she wasn’t there yet.<span data-page="page_final"></span> And so, as Porter wobbled along the light-blotted lanes of the Gardens and vanished, Miriam closed the door and withdrew to face Rose. ♦</p>	Jonathan Lethem	May 6, 2013 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/05/06/the-gray-goose	(Pres.)

The Intermediate Class	<p>When Kiril arrived at Room 2C for the first time that Wednesday evening, he was surprised to hear a piano ringing out from behind the classroom wall. It was early summer, and the community center was almost empty; the children’s camp had been dismissed hours earlier, and in the silence the clustered chords seemed dense and significant, like church bells. He was already late, but he paused for a moment, listening. All day he’d debated backing out at the last minute, though the course was prepaid. Even now, his hand on the doorknob, he felt a slight urge to run. But the music was too intriguing. It drew him through the door.</p><p>He was disappointed, upon entering, to find that there was no piano: just a whiteboard, a long table, and four students arrayed around it. The class turned to him, and suddenly his disappointment seemed foolish—for what business would he have in a music class?</p><p>“Is this Intermediate German?” he asked.</p><p>“That’s right,” a woman with a close-cropped Afro said. “You new?”</p><p>“Yes,” Kiril replied. “I mean, I took a class before. But not here.”</p><p>He chose a seat in the middle of the table: near enough to see the board, but far enough not to seem overeager.</p><p>A pale, thin woman sat next to the woman with the Afro, her arms covered with angular tattoos. “The teacher’s great,” she said. “We had him for Beginning.”</p><p>“Twice,” the woman with the Afro added.</p><p>On the other side of the table sat a Latino man about Kiril’s age, early thirties, with an open smile that was either optimistic or mildly deranged. Next to him, in the corner farthest from the board, sat a white man in his fifties. He was badly sunburned, and seemed to be in a foul mood about it, arms crossed tight above his potbelly.</p><p>The class was more diverse than Kiril had expected. “Why would you want to spend time with old housewives?” his mother had asked, when he’d suggested spending three hundred dollars on a German course. “Lazy American housewives” was what she’d meant: the kind with too much time and money on their hands. Kiril would enjoy telling her she’d been mistaken.</p><p>She’d never approved of his taking German in college. He was majoring in computer science, a practical course of study, and had no time to waste. Besides, he already had the gift of native English: that sprawling, absurd language she’d spent half her life trying to learn. But Kiril had always loved German, which had a name for everything. One morning, at the beginning of class, the professor had brought in an illustrated dictionary with the parts of animals, plants, and various machines written <em>auf Deutsch</em>. He still remembered the picture of a car, deconstructed, every piston and lever lovingly identified. English seemed fuzzy in comparison: a wide blanket, full of holes.</p><p>He heard the piano again, pealing through the adjoining wall. The sound was enormous, as though reverberating in a concert hall much larger than any community center could contain. The music stopped abruptly—a major chord, dying away—and a door opened, hidden behind the whiteboard. A man and a woman emerged, holding sheet music to their chests.</p><p>“Thank you, Claire,” the man said. “What a treat.” He wore a khaki work shirt and pants that zipped at the knee. His beard was silver, but he walked on the balls of his feet, bouncing from left to right.</p><p>The woman looked a bit older than Kiril, and was extremely short: barely five feet tall. She took the last empty seat at the table and looked down at her hands, as if wondering how these tiny fingers could produce such beautiful music.</p><p>The man took his place at the whiteboard. “I see we have a few new faces,” he said. “So let me explain the rules.” He pointed to a bell in the middle of the table. “When I ring this bell, we will no longer speak English. If anyone speaks English, I will act as if I don’t understand. This forces us to take risks with our German—to experiment together.”</p><p>The three women shared a knowing look. Clearly they had great faith in the teacher. The sunburned man, however, seemed terrified, while the man with the airy smile went on smiling, heedless of danger. Kiril decided to follow his lead, though his own smile was forced. He had never been very good at appearing relaxed.</p><p>The teacher rang the bell. Immediately the atmosphere changed. The students rose to attention, serious faces trained on the board.</p><p>“We will introduce ourselves,” the teacher said, in German. “We will talk a little about the things we do in our free time. We know this word, yes? ‘Free time’?”</p><p>He wrote the word on the board: <em>Freizeit</em>. He was calmer in German, less buoyant. He spoke slowly, with a certain sombre attention, like a kindergarten teacher explaining the tragic facts of life.</p><p>He pointed at Kiril. “You first, perhaps?”</p><p>Kiril cocked his head to the right and looked up at the ceiling: a nervous habit his mother referred to as calling on God. She felt he did it more often than was necessary.</p><p>“I have name of Kiril,” he said, too quickly. “Kiril is me.”</p><p>The class smiled, happy to forgive his mistakes—all except the sunburned man in<span data-page="page_2"></span> the corner, who had the sour expression of someone lost and unwilling to ask for directions.</p><p>“I am Kiril,” he said, more slowly this time.</p><p>Everyone said hello.</p><p>“Now, Kiril,” the teacher said. “Tell us what you like to do in your free time.”</p><p>Several images flashed in his mind’s eye: his mother, bent over a sewing machine; a scene from a film in which a monster rose from a tunnel and dangled a frightened man in his claws; Spruce Hill Park after a thunderstorm, dappled rain on light-green leaves.</p><p>“I am running,” he said. “I am running sometimes, but not far. I am running in the park.”</p><p>“What kind of park?” the teacher asked.</p><p>He thought of the muddy bowl where the dogs played, the sound of laughter, and the scent of marijuana, wafting from beneath the trees. He never smoked marijuana, but he loved the smell: herbal and rich in his overactive lungs.</p><p>“I like very much the park,” he said. “It is dark and cool, and in the park there are dogs and people and flowers and trees.”</p><p>The girl who played the piano murmured wordlessly. Perhaps she had similar feelings.</p><p>Kiril began to relax. “And . . . the park . . . is not . . .” Finally the correct word came to him. “Crowded.”</p><p>“It sounds like a beautiful park,” the teacher said. “Now we will continue.”</p><p>It was the sunburned man’s turn. “I is Arthur,” he said. The effort made his face grow even redder. He offered no further information.</p><p>The teacher pointed to the thin girl with the tattoos.</p><p>“I am Morgan,” the girl said, with only slight hesitation. “In my free time I play the guitar.”</p><p>“Very good,” the teacher said, turning to the class. “Now we will ask Morgan some questions.”</p><p>“What kind of music do you play?” the woman with the Afro asked. Her German was stiff and precise: nothing like the casual warmth of her English.</p><p>“I play the slow, sad music,” Morgan said.</p><p>“Why do you play slow and sad music?” the Latino man asked, from across the table. He had been quiet so far, the smile never leaving his face. His grammar was excellent, but his pronunciation was off, and the pale woman had trouble understanding his question. Or maybe, Kiril thought, the question was simply too complicated.</p><p>The teacher jumped into the fray. “ ‘Why’ is a difficult word,” he said. “ ‘What,’ yes. ‘Who,’ yes, and ‘Where.’ These are better, maybe, in the beginning.”</p><p>The Latino man shrugged. He seemed to disagree about the relative merits of “why.”</p><p>“We will continue with you,” the teacher said, pointing in the Latino man’s direction.</p><p>“I am called Alejandro,” he said, squaring his shoulders. “It is a pleasure to meet you.”</p><p>Kiril felt envious of Alejandro’s easy dignity, as if he had a lifetime’s experience talking to strangers.</p><p>“Yes, this is good,” the teacher said. “This is very polite. And in your free time?”</p><p>“I watch the trains,” the man said. “On a nice day, I drive to watch the big trains go to the city. Sometimes on Sundays I am the train driver for the small train. I wear the hat, I drive the people. There is nature on the left. There are trees and flowers, and once there was a fox. It is for to look at nature, the train. I drive it myself or with one person. But myself is very good. I drive the train for three hours, three hours long, and it is very good to me.”</p><p>After he’d finished, there was a long silence.</p><p>“Now we will ask Alejandro questions,” the teacher said.</p><p>“Where does the train go?” the woman with the Afro asked.</p><p>Alejandro smiled again, this time shyly, as if remembering a secret pleasure.</p><p>“It goes round and round,” he said.</p><p>The class clapped politely.</p><p>The woman with the Afro was called Wanda. The following week, at the teacher’s request, she presented an essay on the subject of “My Family.” The essay was meant to demonstrate the past tense. Wanda stood before the class with a piece of paper and read it aloud, her voice firm and slightly clinical.</p><p>“My son is a polite child,” she began. “When he was young, to the church he went. Our family goes to the church every Sunday. When my son became older, to the church he did not go. He says he is busy, but the church is not long, and the spirit is forever. In his free time my son reads books, and is not trouble. But there is trouble in his spirit, and I worry. However, this week a good thing happened. This Sunday he comes with me to the church again. Many churchmen cried. My son feels him good in the spirit, so I am happy. And I hope it will last a long time.”</p><p>The class clapped enthusiastically.</p><p>“Let us write some words,” the teacher said. “We will write ‘church,’ and ‘parishioner,’ and then—very complicated—‘spirit’ and ‘soul’ and even ‘brain’! Yes, words can be complicated.”</p><p>The teacher stepped back from the board and gazed for a moment, transfixed.</p><p>“Now, class,” he said, returning to himself. “Let us thank Wanda for her essay.”</p><p>The class thanked Wanda.</p><p>“Now we will talk about our work life,” the teacher said, writing the word on the board:<span data-page="page_3"></span> <em>Arbeitsleben</em>.</p><p>They had been warned about this subject in advance, and Kiril had prepared a few vocabulary words the night before at the kitchen table, while his mother caught up on alterations: network, <em>Netzwerk;</em> user interface, <em>Benutzeroberfläche</em>.</p><p>“We will start with Alejandro,” the teacher said. “Alejandro, what is interesting about your ‘work life’?”</p><p>“Thank you for asking,” Alejandro said.</p><p>“You are welcome,” the teacher said. “Yes, this is very polite.”</p><p>“I am a driver,” Alejandro said. “I am always driving.”</p><p>“Ah, Alejandro,” the teacher said, pointing at the board. “This conversation is about our work life, not our free time.”</p><p>“It is my work life,” Alejandro insisted. “I am the driver.”</p><p>“You are always the driver?” the teacher asked. He rubbed his eyes.</p><p>“For my work life also I am driving,” Alejandro continued. “In my free time I am driving the train, but in my work life I am driving the truck.”</p><p>The teacher gave a nervous giggle. Alejandro’s smiling insistence seemed to unnerve him. “Why do you enjoy driving so much, Alejandro?”</p><p>For the first time, irritation flashed in Alejandro’s calm gaze. “You said ‘why’ is too difficult,” he said. “Is it too difficult or not?”</p><p>The teacher paused, taken aback. “Yes. Perhaps ‘where’ is better. Where do you drive the truck?”</p><p>Now Alejandro appeared sad. “I go round and round,” he said.</p><p>Kiril was impressed by the range of Alejandro’s emotions. He himself sometimes felt trapped in a single mood: a kind of pressurized worry, marbled with sadness, through which flecks of pleasure were visible during certain parts of the day—mostly in the evening, when the sun set over the gabled Victorians near the park, edging them with fire.</p><p>“Perhaps it is time for a break,” the teacher said.</p><p>He rang the bell, and he and Claire disappeared through the hidden door. Music rippled from behind the wall. Kiril was aware of the air in the room, the currents within it like water. He looked at Arthur, but Arthur pretended not to see him, glaring into space. He looked at Alejandro, and the man’s smile deepened, becoming more complex. Kiril wondered if he had seen Alejandro in the neighborhood before, while he was doing errands for his mother, or visiting one of his cousins who lived in the warren-like streets south of the park. If he saw him again, he would raise his hand in friendship.</p><p>The door behind the whiteboard opened, and Claire and the teacher emerged.</p><p>“Wonderful, just wonderful.” The teacher turned to the class. “That was Schubert’s ‘Fantasy for Four Hands.’ ”</p><p>The students nodded, but only automatically. The title of the piece meant nothing to them.</p><p>“Now we will have pair conversation.” The teacher cracked his knuckles.</p><p>Kiril was afraid he would be forced into a pair with Arthur, who continued scowling at his phone long after class had resumed. It was a great relief to be placed with Alejandro instead.</p><p>The teacher wrote the subject on the board: “My Home Life.” As the students talked, he sat by the window and looked out at the damp green night with an expression of melancholic attraction. He looked like the captain from a movie Kiril had once seen on cable: the captain of an ancient vessel, fated to sink.</p><p>“I live with my mother,” Kiril told Alejandro. “It is pleasant, but the house is small. Too small, sometimes. I have to go out.”</p><p>“To the park,” Alejandro said. “You run in the park.”</p><p>Kiril was happy he remembered; it made him more comfortable. He didn’t consider it shameful, living with his mother. Many of his cousins were in the same situation, and even those who were married or lived alone saw nothing odd about it. It was a matter of respect, of being a dutiful son. Still, it wasn’t something he would ordinarily share with a stranger.</p><p>“Yes,” he said. “I am in the park running. And it is cool and not crowded, and there are flowers and trees.”</p><p>Alejandro smiled and closed his eyes, the vision blooming in his mind. The park was only a few blocks from the community center. Perhaps they had passed each other at some point during their wanderings: under the tall sycamores, through the loose blue stones.</p><p>“Why do you run?” Alejandro asked, softly, as if aware that he was breaking the rules.</p><p>“I do not know,” Kiril said. “Let me think.”</p><p>He was not used to expressing these sorts of feelings. As a child, he might have talked to his mother about them, or even to God, but now that he was an adult, alone in bed at night, the silence lay heavy on his stomach and his lungs.</p><p>“I am running because there is a pain in my head,” he said. “My eyes hurt with work and there is a head pain. Then I am running and there is no head pain. Especially in fall, the best season, the season that is the best. The cool season, with many birds.”</p><p>“I see,” Alejandro said. “It is clear. I like fall also.”</p><p>Here they had exhausted the appropriate words.</p><p>“Where do you live?” Kiril asked. He had to force himself to use the casual <em>du</em>. Sometimes, when he searched for German, Russian came to him instead, and he reverted to the patterns of childhood. “Always be respectful to strangers,” his mother told him. “You’re not the sort of<span data-page="page_4"></span> person who can afford to be impolite.”</p><p>Alejandro sighed. “I am living with men who are not so good,” he said. “Fight-men.”</p><p>“That is a little bad,” Kiril said, though he didn’t fully understand.</p><p>“Let us come back to the table,” the teacher said. “We will read a poem about a miller, a brook, and a waterwheel. It is an old poem, but it has words that will be helpful for you to know.”</p><p>The class read the poem out loud, one student at a time. Kiril remembered it from somewhere: some distant fluorescent classroom, shaded with humiliation. When it was Alejandro’s turn, he read carefully and fluently, as if he understood the poem’s meaning, though it was from the eighteenth century: a time of simple emotions, travelling handymen, and light flickering on water. Perhaps in another time Alejandro would have been this miller, Kiril thought. He would have wandered the woods, ever hopeful, eyes dazzled by sudden flashes of sunlight.</p><p>The following week, they discussed where they liked to go on vacation: the shore, the mountains, abroad. When the discussion was over, it was Claire’s turn to read an essay in front of the class.</p><p>“My essay is titled ‘An Interesting Week,’ ” she said, and began to read.</p><p>Kiril had come to enjoy the calm commitment of her voice, the way the others leaned in to hear it. She wore large glasses—perhaps, Kiril thought, to magnify her tiny eyes.</p><p>“I wanted to have an exciting week,” she said, “in order to write an essay the class would find interesting. But on Friday my boyfriend was sick, and I was only able to do such interesting things as travelling to the pharmacy and taking his temperature. Then on Saturday I became sick, and did such interesting things as coughing, shaking, and dreaming in a fever. On Sunday we both felt better, and so we did such interesting things as reading, drinking tea, and sweeping the dusty house. I was worried. I asked my boyfriend if my life was a little boring. My boyfriend is a serious person. He thought for a long time. He told me that everybody’s life is a little boring, if you write it down.”</p><p>The essay seemed to confuse the students. They searched the teacher’s eyes for an explanation. Kiril, however, found it clear and precise. It seemed to express fundamental truths about existence.</p><p>The teacher clapped. “It is a complicated essay!” he said. “It is a little <em>komisch</em>. Let us write some of the words. We say ‘cough,’ ‘coughed,’ ‘has coughed.’ We say ‘dream,’ ‘dreamt,’ ‘has dreamt.’ We say ‘shake,’ ‘shook,’ ‘has shaken.’ ”</p><p>He wrote on the board in wide, looping arcs, then stopped to examine his handiwork. He frowned, as if troubled by the images such words implied.</p><p>“Did you not play piano this week, Claire?” he asked. “That would be interesting.”</p><p>“No,” Claire said, with a resigned expression.</p><p>“No?” the teacher asked. “You did not play? Or playing the piano is not interesting?”</p><p>“I do not have piano.”</p><p>The teacher seemed lost. “You do not have a piano?”</p><p>“A piano is very expensive, and my house is small.”</p><p>“Ah, but you should have a piano,” the teacher said. “You play so well. Your boyfriend can buy you a piano.”</p><p>“My boyfriend?” Claire stifled a laugh.</p><p>The teacher seemed momentarily shaken, though Kiril couldn’t understand why. Perhaps he was afraid of losing control of the conversation.</p><p>“Yes, as a gift,” he insisted. “Because you play so well.”</p><p>Perhaps the teacher meant it as a joke, but something about the intensity of his voice suggested otherwise. The discussion was becoming too personal; the students shifted in their seats.</p><p>Claire did not laugh. “My boyfriend will not buy me a piano,” she said, evenly, refusing to echo the teacher’s emotions.</p><p>The teacher nodded sadly, as if this news confirmed sad truths about life that he generally chose to forget. Kiril wondered if the teacher’s duets with Claire were the sweetest part of his week: something to look forward to, on otherwise unremarkable evenings. Maybe in solitary moments he imagined her small hands dancing across the keys.</p><p>“The piano is a very expensive instrument,” the teacher said, finally. On the board he wrote, <em>Ein Klavier ist ein sehr teures Instrument</em>.</p><p>The class wrote the sentence down dutifully, with the exception of Claire, who already knew all about it.</p><p>“And where is Alejandro?” the teacher asked. “The man who is always driving.”</p><p>“Alejandro is not here,” Kiril said.</p><p>He had noticed Alejandro’s absence as soon as class began, and as the minutes ticked by his disappointment had grown ever larger, until he had a hard time focussing on the discussion. Wanda and Morgan were already paired, Claire and the teacher were always disappearing behind the wall, and Arthur repelled all human contact. Kiril had hoped that, of all of them, Alejandro might become his friend.</p><p>“Alejandro is a good student,” Wanda said, clearly and with perfect pronunciation. “His German is very good, despite his accent.”</p><p>Kiril wondered if she had practiced lines like these at home, about each of them: <em>Arthur learns very slowly. Kiril speaks too quickly, he is nervous.</em> It seemed unfair to talk like this, behind someone’s back.</p><p>“But having an accent all of us!” he said, his voice a shade too loud. “It is natural, and he<span data-page="page_5"></span> speaks well and he asks good questions. He is a very good student, the best!”</p><p>Now the students looked afraid, as if he had threatened them. Kiril was filled with remorse.</p><p>“I am sorry,” he said. “I am making many mistakes.”</p><p>“It is my fault,” the teacher said. “Let us not speak of Alejandro. Probably he is sick. He is taking a sick day. There is a word for this.”</p><p>He wrote it on the board: <em>Krankentag.</em></p><p>“Yes, that is good,” he said, stepping back. “If you use this word, you will sound like a native speaker.”</p><p>The class wrote the word down.</p><p>After that day, Claire and the teacher no longer played the piano together. During the next class, while Morgan read a halting essay about her political activism—“I am walking against the government; I am walking with many others to the large building of the government, holding hands”—Kiril watched Claire out of the corner of his eye. Whenever Morgan spoke an unfamiliar word, Claire wrote it down in her notebook. Later, during the break, newly bereft of music, she checked these words against an online dictionary, clarifying their gender and their endings and making small corrections. The teacher played in the other room, alone, the pieces softer, more restrained.</p><p>Alejandro did not come to the next class, or the one after that. Kiril waited for him to appear, the way in high school he had waited for far-fetched things to break up the tedium: sudden snowstorms, a citywide blackout, subtle variations on the end of the world. In the meantime, he paired up with other students: with Wanda for “My Childhood,” with Morgan for “My Student Life.”</p><p>He was glad that he was not paired with Claire. He found her quiet precision intimidating, and preferred to watch her from the other side of the room.</p><p>It was the middle of July now: their second-to-last class. Kiril was disappointed that the course would soon be over. Not because it had been particularly helpful—his German was improving only slowly—but because he felt as if an opportunity had been lost. Sometimes, as they stumbled through conversations about their parents and their pets, he felt like a person in a dream who hears a party happening in a nearby house. His legs are frozen; if only he could float through the window, like a piece of colored paper, and slip at last into the living world.</p><p>“Now we will do a short exercise,” the teacher said. “We will say a few sentences about what led us to learn German.”</p><p>Wanda consulted her notes. “There is a man at my church who studies the piano,” she said. “He plays and sings a different kind of music. I didn’t know the words. It was in a different language. It was German, he said. It was so, so beautiful music.”</p><p>“Very good, Wanda,” the teacher said.</p><p>“They said it was too expensive,” Wanda went on, disregarding her notes. “But the money is mine, and I will spend it. Some people do not understand. Because of small minds.”</p><p>Suddenly, Claire began to speak: haltingly, at first, as if Wanda’s story had woken her from a nap. It seemed to Kiril that she had become more tentative as the class went on—not because her German was deteriorating but because the emotions she wanted to describe were becoming more complex.</p><p>“I am like Wanda,” she said. “But I was the one who played the piano. I knew the words, but I wanted to know them better. I thought . . . that if I knew them better . . . I would feel differently. And then . . . I did. And it was different . . . than I thought it would be. And then time went by, a long time, and then I didn’t play the piano.”</p><p>While Claire talked, the teacher stared at the ceiling. When she was finished, he rubbed his eyes.</p><p>“We will turn to the essay,” he said. “Arthur is worried about his grammar, so we will help him. He will read a sentence, and we will correct him. Then I will write the sentence on the board.”</p><p>Arthur got slowly to his feet. “The title of my essay is ‘My Wife,’ ” he said.</p><p>Arthur hardly ever spoke, and yet his German had improved the most, Kiril thought. Not that he realized it—he was fixated on his mistakes.</p><p>“My wife is German,” Arthur began. “My wife in the Army is meeting.”</p><p>“I met my wife in the Army,” Wanda said. “It is correct.”</p><p>“I was in Germany,” Arthur continued. “She is the East.”</p><p>“She lives in the East,” Kiril corrected.</p><p>“She is from the East,” Morgan said. “She is from East Germany.”</p><p>The teacher wrote the corrections on the board, bouncing from foot to foot. Only when his hands were moving did he seem truly happy.</p><p>“In the East they speak German,” Arthur said. “In the East they do not speak English. But we have this language.”</p><p>Here Arthur mumbled, as if refining the words like rough rocks in his mouth.</p><p>“Secret,” he managed, after a while. “Secret.”</p><p>“Is it a <em>secret language</em>?” Claire asked.</p><p>Kiril found himself staring at Claire. He tried to turn away, for the sake of politeness and to follow the exercise, but his eyes were drawn back each time she spoke, to her odd, self-satisfied<span data-page="page_6"></span> smile. She seemed to be aware of some joke the rest of them couldn’t grasp.</p><p>“Yes, thank you,” Arthur said. “We have a <em>secret language</em>. In the old.”</p><p>“A long time ago,” Claire said. The phrase stirred her. She smiled thinly.</p><p>Arthur sighed. “We have a <em>secret</em> a long time ago.”</p><p>“And now?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“And now?” Arthur echoed. The essay slipped from his hands and fell to the floor, and he cursed.</p><p>“Perhaps it would be better to move on,” the teacher suggested.</p><p>Arthur did not pick up the paper. “I want to speak to my wife, but not in German,” he said, voice trembling.</p><p>“I want to speak to my wife in German,” Wanda corrected.</p><p>“No!” Arthur’s voice was suddenly gruff, almost barking. “I want to speak to my wife not in German.”</p><p>Claire murmured, “You want the <em>secret language</em>.”</p><p>“Yes,” Arthur said. “This is better. But it is so, so speaking difficult.”</p><p>Claire nodded. “It is perhaps impossible.”</p><p>“Yes,” Arthur replied. “It is far away and difficult.”</p><p>“It is not so difficult,” Wanda said, strictly, as if chastising a lazy child.</p><p>“It is not so difficult,” Kiril agreed—though of course it was the most difficult thing in the world.</p><p>“No,” the teacher cried, in sudden anguish. “It is not impossible! Two people who speak a language well will come one day to the ‘secret language.’ It is not so different from what we do. It is there every day, all the time, when you speak! I promise, it is not so far away!”</p><p>He stopped and leaned against the desk. Kiril wished the teacher could be calmer, less concerned with the emotions of others. But he supposed that was the way teachers always were. Their satisfaction hinged on the lives of strangers.</p><p>“Are you healthy?” Arthur asked the teacher.</p><p>The teacher stared at him blankly.</p><p>“Are you all right?” Claire asked.</p><p>“Yes,” the teacher said. Blinking, he stood up straight again, and forced a laugh. “I am only a little tired.”</p><p>He wrote it on the board—<em>Ich bin nur ein bisschen müde</em>—but the class was too shocked to copy it down.</p><p>“Next week is our last class,” the teacher informed them. “We will all bring something to eat. Please write a food you will bring on the list. It is nice if it is homemade, but it is not necessary. People are busy.”</p><p>He passed the list. “Please write down one dish you think everyone will like,” it read, in English. Kiril wrote down “pierogies,” as he always did when someone asked him to represent his culture. The women at his mother’s church sold them, in order to save the Orthodox orphans in distant countries.</p><p>When the class left the community center, the air was wet and heavy. It had rained, or else it was going to rain—Kiril wasn’t sure which. With little ringing sounds of friendship, the students scattered like drops of water. Wanda and Morgan walked west, while Arthur fell into a car with a rusted roof and roared away. That left Claire and Kiril alone at the trolley stop, which was confusing. Claire had never waited at the trolley stop before.</p><p>“Change of plans?” he asked.</p><p>“I’ve moved,” Claire replied.</p><p>This brought up a host of questions. Had she and her boyfriend moved together, or had she left him, striking out on her own? Why had she decided to move at the height of summer, when the air could be so hot and heavy you hardly knew how to breathe? Was she happy in her new place? Would she become happy there, given time?</p><p>Kiril didn’t feel that he had the right to ask any of these questions, now that class was over. Instead, they talked about the teacher’s sudden outburst.</p><p>“He tries so hard,” Claire said. “But he’s a bit ridiculous, isn’t he? I can’t imagine the pay is good.”</p><p>Kiril couldn’t disagree, and yet he felt the urge to defend the teacher. The world they had built together seemed a fragile, tenuous thing; one stray word and it might collapse entirely—and in a week it would be over, no matter how well they behaved.</p><p>The trolley was coming down the hill. Kiril wanted to tell Claire something before it arrived. He wanted to explain that he was nothing like the teacher, that he was not a ridiculous person, though he might seem so, in that awkward little room. He had a mother he loved, even if she was old-fashioned and stiff; he had cousins whom he saw every weekend; friends from school with whom he went to movies and bars; women he dated from time to time, without forming long-term attachments; a job that paid well, where he was respected, even essential. He had a full life, a full world.</p><p>But why would she care? To her, he didn’t exist beyond the boundaries of the classroom; and the same was true of her, for him, for everyone. Still, he wanted to tell her: not about loneliness, exactly, but about a strange feeling that sometimes came over him, now that he was taking the German class. He would be riding the subway, or walking in the park, and the faces that appeared before him seemed less like strangers locked in silence than like people who might offer him their secrets, if given a small room, a whiteboard, a friendly teacher. On the<span data-page="page_7"></span> trolley ride home, the windows were full of other people’s lives.</p><p>The trolley stopped, folding its accordion doors. They climbed on board.</p><p>“You must be tired,” Kiril told her. “I’ll leave you to your book.”</p><p>He could feel the formality of his English. He wished he had the courage to speak to her only in German, here in public, no matter who might overhear.</p><p>She smiled. Perhaps she knew what he was thinking, for she replied in German. “<em>Yes</em>,” she said. “<em>My voice is tired</em>.”</p><p>“<em>Ja, natürlich</em>.” He smiled at the words, flowing so easily from his mouth. “<em>Tschüss.</em>”</p><p>“<em>Tschüss</em>,” she replied, and took her seat.</p><p>He sat a few rows behind her and looked out the window, toward the Victorian homes that faced the park and, above them, the purple crown of the sky. He knew that she was looking, too, lines of German echoing in her head, until the last echoes faded, replaced by the music of daily life: overheard complaints; lyrics from the summer’s hip-hop hits; the sound of the conductor, naming the streets he travelled every day, round and round.</p><p>It was easy to drift back into it, like a dream that lasted for years. When Kiril looked up again, Claire was gone.</p><p>On their last night together, twenty minutes after the class had started—after they had drunk a little of the dark beer the teacher had brought, after they had agreed to talk one last time in German only—Alejandro appeared in the doorway. His shirt was torn, and Kiril thought he could see the yellow outline of a bruise at the edge of his right eye socket.</p><p>The teacher tried to mask his surprise. “Alejandro, hello,” he said. “It is good to see you.”</p><p>“It is very nice to see you as well,” Alejandro said. “I would like to apologize for my long absence.”</p><p>“It is no problem,” the teacher replied. “We are glad you are back. This is our final class party. We are talking about our language goals and practicing our future tense. We are appreciating how much we learned together.”</p><p>“Yes, we learned a lot,” Alejandro said.</p><p>“Happy we are to have Alejandro back,” Kiril said, though what he really felt was a sense of foreboding. It was as if they were moving backward in time, becoming more innocent and less skilled.</p><p>“We are all very happy,” Wanda said.</p><p>The teacher got up and poured Alejandro a glass of beer.</p><p>“Thank you very much,” Alejandro said, taking a sip. “The beer is pleasing to me.”</p><p>“Now, Alejandro,” the teacher said. “We will talk about our language goals. For example: Claire, what is your goal?”</p><p>“I will read poetry,” Claire said, “and write my <em>komischen</em> stories.”</p><p>They gave their goals to Alejandro, one by one. Kiril would listen to German songs as he ran in the park. Arthur would ask his wife about her day. Wanda would learn the lyrics to the old songs the man in her church had played for her.</p><p>“You see how it is done, Alejandro,” the teacher said.</p><p>“It is complicated,” Alejandro said.</p><p>“This is the last class,” the teacher said. “Try, please.”</p><p>“I am having a hard time with friends,” Alejandro began. He spoke more slowly than Kiril remembered, more stiffly. Perhaps his jaw was injured. “I am trying to talk to people in many languages. But people do not talk. I am thinking they are strict; they are too strict, and then they become angry. I am thinking I will take a class and we will talk to each other in the class and it will be easier. I am thinking we will say what we must say, and we will be friends. But we do not make friends, because language is strict and we do not understand difficult things. When you do not understand, you get angry. It is natural. How can you understand when things are strict? You cannot understand!”</p><p>“You can understand,” Wanda said. “Although it is strict, you a little understand.”</p><p>“You understand only small things!” Alejandro said. His hands were balled into fists, and the fists were trembling. “There is no point, the weather, there is no point, the weekend! My goal is real talking! My goal is friends! But it is so hard to talk in the work life, the home life. And where are the friends?”</p><p>“There are friends,” Kiril insisted. Something had gone wrong, though he didn’t know where, exactly. They were all so willing; you’d think they would have learned something.</p><p>Claire laughed quietly. “This is a little <em>komisch</em>.”</p><p>“Please, stop,” the teacher said, raising his hands. “Please, let us have a little pause.”</p><p>He rang the bell.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” he said to them, in English. “But there are limitations. We don’t have much time, and then there are the varying language levels. Oh, you’re right, Alejandro, it’s too stiff, it’s too strict, too expensive—and it’s not enough. But we have to do <em>something</em>, don’t we? Isn’t something better than nothing?”</p><p>“Jesus Christ,” Arthur said. “This class is three hundred dollars.”</p><p>“Yes, the money,” the teacher said. “And I only get half. But no—let’s not. That’s the shallow way.”</p><p>“Easy for you to say,” Arthur said.</p><p>“I am sorry,” Alejandro said. “I was inappropriate before. I spoke too quickly. I understand you better now.”</p><p>“Do you?” the teacher asked. “<em>I</em> don’t even<span data-page="page_final"></span> understand me.”</p><p>The class stared blankly. Kiril would have liked to speak up, to let the teacher know he agreed with him, and that he forgave him everything—and yet it wasn’t the sort of thing he would say, in any language.</p><p>“Please,” the teacher said. “Please come with me. I wanted to give you all a treat, on the last day. I wanted to do something special.”</p><p>He led them behind the whiteboard and through the hidden door. On the other side of the wall was a small auditorium, with a grand piano set up on a stage. There were no seats, only a host of unused air-conditioners lying in rows, covered with plastic cases. Kiril realized, suddenly, what a cool, lush summer it had been so far. One never noticed the soothing parts of life. They passed like afternoon hours, like breath.</p><p>The teacher went to the piano and lifted the keyboard cover. “You need something underneath the language,” he said. “Something to hold on to.” Now he switched to German. “<em>I am playing the piano</em>,” he said, pressing the keys. “<em>I am playing some Schubert: ‘Der Erlkönig.’ You can hear it</em>? <em>Here is the horse, in the left hand. You can hear it, yes</em>? <em>You understand</em>?”</p><p>Claire closed her eyes. “<em>I can hear it.</em>”</p><p>“What is this horseshit?” Arthur asked.</p><p>“<em>This is his music</em>,” Alejandro replied.</p><p>The teacher played faster. “<em>And now the wind is rising. And now we are hearing the boy, who is frightened. You know he is frightened because he sounds frightened. And here is the father. You can hear he is strong, in his voice. You would know it, even if you did not understand.</em>”</p><p>“<em>I understand</em>,” Claire said. “<em>It is clear</em>.”</p><p>Kiril doubted that anyone could hear her, other than him. She was very close, on his right, though she barely came to his shoulder. She seemed to belong in this other room, with the piano. He could hardly believe they had once talked on the trolley, shuttling down the tracks like a clumsy, mechanical beetle. He was ashamed of how proud he had been, to speak to her.</p><p>“And now the demon arrives, the Demon King,” the teacher said, switching to English. “And he wants to take the little boy to the land of the dead. You can hear it: his voice is seductive.”</p><p>“I’m leaving,” Arthur yelled. “I wasted my damn money.”</p><p>“Go ahead and leave, then,” Wanda hissed.</p><p>Arthur crossed his arms tighter, helpless in his anger.</p><p>The teacher played faster now, switching back to German. “<em>The boy is afraid, but the father cannot hear what the Demon King is saying. And now the melody is too bright, like when someone talks without listening. That is how the man talks. And then the boy says that the Demon King is hurting him, causing him pain. Listen: here is how it sounds.</em>”</p><p>He played for a minute without speaking: high, bitter chords, like someone breaking ice with a hammer.</p><p>“<em>That is the wind again,</em>” Claire said. “<em>I can hear it.</em>”</p><p>Kiril felt a pleasurable pain move up his spine. He thought of cool wind in the branches in <em>Herbst:</em> the season with the correct name, but only in English.</p><p>Now the song was over, the ice-chords fading to silence.</p><p>“<em>I do not need to tell you what happens</em>,” the teacher said. “<em>You know.</em>”</p><p>“The boy dies,” Wanda said.</p><p>“<em>Natürlich</em>,” Claire said, the last, clustered consonant a whisper.</p><p>“<em>But it is so, so beautiful</em>,” Kiril said.</p><p>The teacher nodded. He closed the cover. From outside came the sound of sudden rain. ♦</p>	Sam Allingham	April 2, 2018 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/02/the-intermediate-class	German	Language	Friendship	Strangers	Adult Education		Kiril	Third	Immigrants
The Last Words on Earth	<p>When <span data-page="page_1"></span>they write my obituary. Tomorrow. Or the next day. It will say, “Leo Gursky is survived by an apartment full of shit.” I’m surprised I haven’t been buried alive. I have to struggle to keep a path clear between bed and toilet, toilet and kitchen table, table and front door. If I want to get from the toilet to the front door, I have to go by way of the kitchen table. I like to imagine the bed as home plate, the toilet as first, the kitchen table as second, the front door as third: should the doorbell ring while I am lying in bed, I have to round the toilet and the kitchen table in order to arrive at the door. If it happens to be Bruno, I let him in without a word and then jog back to bed, the roar of the invisible crowd ringing in my ears.</p><p>I often wonder who will be the last person to see me alive. If I had to bet, I’d bet on the delivery boy from the Chinese takeout. I order in four nights out of seven. Whenever he comes, I make a big production of finding my wallet. He stands at the door holding the greasy bag while I wonder if this is the night I’ll finish off my spring roll, climb into bed, and have a heart attack in my sleep.</p><p>I try to make a point of being seen. Often when I’m out I’ll buy a juice, even if I’m not thirsty. If the store is crowded, I’ll sometimes go so far as to drop my change all over the floor, the nickels and dimes skidding in every direction. I’ll go into the Athlete’s Foot and say, “What do you have in sneakers?” The clerk will look me over like the poor schmuck that I am and direct me to the one pair of Rockports they carry, something in spanking white. “Nah,” I’ll say, “I have those already,” and then I’ll make my way over to the Reeboks and pick out something that doesn’t even resemble a shoe, a waterproof bootie, maybe, and ask for it in size 9. The kid will look again, more carefully. “Size 9,” I’ll repeat, holding his gaze while I clutch the webbed shoe. He’ll shake his head and go to the back for them, and by the time he returns I’m peeling off my socks. I’ll roll my pant legs up and look down at those decrepit things my feet, and an awkward minute will pass until it becomes clear that I’m waiting for him to slip the booties onto them. I never actually buy. All I want is not to die on a day when I went unseen.</p><p>A few months ago, I saw an ad in the paper. It said, “<em class="small">needed: nude model for drawing class. $15 an hour.”</em> It seemed too good to be true. To have so much looked at. By so many. I called the number. A woman told me to come the following Tuesday. I tried to describe myself, but she wasn’t interested. “Anything will do,” she said.</p><p>The days passed slowly. I told Bruno about it, but he misunderstood. He thought I was signing up for a drawing class in order to see nude girls. He didn’t want to be corrected. “Their breasts?”he asked. “They show their boobs?” I shrugged. “And down there?”</p><p>After Mrs. Freid on the fourth floor died and it took three days for anyone to find her, Bruno and I got into the habit of checking on each other. We’d make little excuses—“I ran out of toilet paper,” I’d say when Bruno opened his door. A day would pass. There would be a knock on my door. “I lost my <em>TV Guide,</em>” he’d explain, and I’d go and find him mine, even though I knew his was right where it always was, on his couch. Once, he came down on a Sunday afternoon. “I need a cup of flour,” he said. It was clumsy, but I couldn’t help myself. “You don’t know how to cook,” I said. There was a moment of silence. Bruno looked me in the eye. “What do you know,” he said. “I’m baking a cake.”</p><p>When I came to America, I knew hardly anyone, only a second cousin who was a locksmith, so I worked for him. If he’d been a shoemaker, I would have been a shoemaker; if he had shovelled shit, I, too, would have shovelled. But he was a locksmith, he taught me the trade, and that’s what I became. We had a little business together, and then one year he got TB. They had to cut his liver out, and he got a 106 temperature and died, so I took it over. I went on sending his wife half the profits, even after she married a doctor and moved to Bayside. I stayed in the business for more than fifty years. It’s not what I would have imagined for myself. And yet. The truth is I came to like it. I helped in those who were locked out; others I helped keep out what shouldn’t be let in, so that they could sleep without nightmares.</p><p>Then one day I was looking out the window. Maybe I was contemplating the sky. Put even a fool in front of the window<span data-page="page_2"></span> and you’ll get a Spinoza; in the end life makes window-watchers of us all. The afternoon went by; little grains of darkness sifted down. I reached for the chain on the bulb and suddenly it was as if an elephant had stepped on my heart. I fell to my knees. I thought, I didn’t live forever. A minute passed. Another minute. Another. I clawed at the floor, pulling myself along toward the phone.</p><p>Twenty-five per cent of my heart muscle died. It took time to recover, and I never went back to work. I stared out the window. I watched fall turn into winter, winter into spring. I dragged myself upstairs to sit with Bruno.</p><p>Bruno and I were friends when we were boys. When I came to America, I thought he was dead, and then one day I was walking down East Broadway and I heard his voice. I turned around. He was standing in front of the grocer’s asking the price of some fruit. I thought, You’re hearing things, you’re such a dreamer, what is the likelihood—your boyhood friend? I stood frozen on the sidewalk. He’s in the ground, I told myself. It’s fifty years later, here you are in the United States of America, there’s McDonald’s, get a grip. I waited just to make sure. I wouldn’t have recognized his face. But the way he walked was unmistakable—skipping along like a bird. He was about to pass me. I put my arm out and grabbed his sleeve. “Bruno,” I said. He stopped and turned. At first he seemed scared and then confused. “Bruno,” I said. He looked at me; his eyes filled with tears. He touched his hand to my cheek; with the other he held a bag of plums. “Bruno.”</p><p>A couple of years later, his wife died. Living in their apartment without her was too much for him, so when an apartment opened up on the floor above me he moved in. We often sit together at my kitchen table. A whole afternoon can go by without our saying a word. If we do talk, we never speak in Yiddish. The words of our childhood became strangers to us long ago—we couldn’t use them in the same way, and so we chose not to use them at all. Life demanded a new language.</p><p>When I was a boy, I liked to write. I wrote three books before I was twenty-one. The first was about S., the village in Poland where I lived. I drew a map of it for the frontispiece, labelling each house and shop: here was Kipnis the butcher, and here Pinsky the tailor, and here lived Fishl Shapiro, who was either a great tzaddik or an idiot, no one could decide, and here the village square and the field where we played, and here where the forest began, and here stood the tree from which Beyla Asch had hanged herself, and here and here. And yet. When I gave it to the only person in S. whose opinion I cared about, she just shrugged and said maybe it would be better if I made things up. So I wrote a second book, and I filled it with men who grew wings, and trees with their roots growing into the sky, and people who forgot their own names, and people who couldn’t forget anything. When it was finished, I ran all the way to her house. I leaned against a wall and watched her face as she read it. It got dark outside, but she kept reading. Hours went by. I slid to the floor. When she finished, she looked up. At first she didn’t speak. Then she said that perhaps I shouldn’t make up <em>everything</em>, because that made it hard to believe anything.</p><p>Another person might have given up. I started again. This time I didn’t write about real things and I didn’t write about imaginary things. I wrote about the only thing I knew. I made a book of my love for her. I wrote and I wrote. The pages piled up. I was saying everything for the first time. Even after the only person whose opinion I cared about had left on a boat for America, I continued to fill pages with her name.</p><p>Soon after she left, everything fell apart. Hitler invaded Poland. There were rumors of unfathomable things, and because we could not fathom them we failed to believe them—until we had no choice and it was too late. By the time I believed, I’d shed the only part of me that had ever thought I’d find words for even the smallest bit of life.</p><p>And yet. A couple of months after my heart attack, fifty-seven years after I’d given it up, I started to write again. I did it for myself alone; that was the difference. I knew it would be impossible to find the right words. And because I accepted that what I’d once believed possible was, in fact, impossible, and because I knew that I would never show a page of it to anyone, I wrote a sentence: <em>I fell in love when I was ten.</em></p><p>It remained there, staring up from the otherwise blank page for days. The next week I added another. Soon there was a whole page. It made me happy. Like I said, I was doing it for myself.<span data-page="page_3"></span></p><p>Once, I said to Bruno, “Take a guess. How many pages do you think I have?” “No idea,” Bruno said. “Write a number,” I said, “and slip it across the table.” He shrugged and took a pen out of his pocket. He thought for a minute or two, studying my face. “A ballpark guess,” I said. He hunched over his napkin, scrawled a number, and turned it over. I wrote down the real number, 301, on my own napkin. We pushed the napkins across the table. I picked up Bruno’s. For reasons I can’t explain, he had written 200,000. He picked up my napkin and turned it over. His face fell.</p><p>Sometimes I open my book and read from it at random. There are passages I know by heart. <em>By heart</em>—this is not an expression I use lightly. My heart is weak and unreliable. I try to burden it as little as possible. If something is going to have an impact, I direct it elsewhere. My gut, for example, or my lungs. When I pass a mirror and catch a glimpse of myself, or I’m at the bus stop and some kids come up behind me and say, “Who smells shit?”—small daily humiliations that are par for the course—these I take, generally speaking, in my liver. The pancreas I reserve for being struck by all that’s been lost. It’s true that there’s so much, and the organ is so small. But. You would be surprised how much it can take. When I wake up and my fingers are stiff, almost certainly I was dreaming of my childhood. All the times I have suddenly remembered that my parents are dead (even now it still surprises me to exist in the world while those who made me have ceased to exist): my knees. To everything a season; to every time I’ve woken only to make the mistake of believing for a moment that someone is sleeping beside me: a hemorrhoid. Loneliness: there is no organ that can take it all.</p><p>O_nce upon a time there was a boy._ He lived in a village that no longer exists, in a house that no longer exists, on the edge of a field that no longer exists. Once upon a time there was a boy who lived in a house across the field from a girl who no longer exists. They made up a thousand games. They collected the world in small handfuls, and they were never unfair to each other, not once. When the sky grew dark, they parted with burrs in their clothes and leaves in their hair.</p><p>When they were ten, he asked her to marry him. When they were eleven, he kissed her for the first time. When they were thirteen, they got into a fight and for three terrible weeks they didn’t talk. When they were fifteen, she showed him the scar on her left breast. Their love was a secret they told no one. He promised her he would never love another girl as long as he lived. “What if I die?” she asked. “Even then,” he said. For her sixteenth birthday, he gave her a Polish-English dictionary and together they studied the words. “What’s this?” he’d ask, tracing his index finger around her ankle, and she’d look it up. “And this?” he’d ask, kissing her elbow. “ ‘Elbow’! What kind of word is that?” And then he’d lick it, making her giggle. When they were seventeen, they made love for the first time, on a bed of straw in a shed. Later—when things had happened that they never could have imagined—she wrote him a letter that said, “When will you learn that there isn’t a word for everything?”</p><p>Once upon a time there was a boy who loved a girl whose father was shrewd enough to scrounge together all the zlotys he had to send his daughter on a boat to America. At first she refused to go, but the boy also knew enough to insist, swearing on his life that he’d earn some money and find a way to follow her. He got a job as a janitor at a hospital and he saved as much as he could. But, in the summer of 1941, the <em>Einsatzkommandos</em> drove their armies farther east; on a bright, hot day in July, they entered S. At that hour, the boy happened to be lying on his back in the woods, thinking about the girl. You could say it was his love for her that saved him. In the years that followed, the boy became a man who became invisible. In this way, he escaped death.</p><p>Once upon a time the man who had become invisible arrived in America. He had spent four years hiding, mostly in trees but also in cellars and holes. Then the Russian tanks rolled in. For five months, he lived in a displaced-persons camp. He got word to his cousin, who was a locksmith in America. In his head, he practiced over and over the only words he knew in English. <em>Knee. Elbow. Ear.</em> Finally, his papers came through. He took a train to a boat, and after a week of passage arrived in New York Harbor. Folded in his hand was the girl’s address. That night, he lay awake on the floor of his cousin’s room. The radiator clanged and hissed, but he was<span data-page="page_4"></span> grateful for the warmth. In the morning, his cousin explained to him how to take the subway to Brooklyn. Only as his finger pressed her doorbell did it cross his mind that perhaps he should have called, so as not to give her a heart attack. She opened the door. She wore a blue scarf over her hair. He could hear the broadcast of a ballgame through the neighbor’s wall.</p><p>Once upon a time the woman who had been a girl got on a boat to America and threw up all the way there, not because she was seasick but because she was pregnant. When she found out, she wrote to the boy. Every day, she waited for a letter from him, but none came. She got bigger and bigger. She tried to hide it so as not to lose her job at the dress factory. A few weeks before the baby was born, she got a letter from someone who told her what had happened to the town of S. She stopped going to work. She couldn’t bring herself to get out of bed. After a week, the son of her boss came to see her. He brought her food to eat and put a bouquet of flowers in a vase by her bed. When he found out that she was pregnant, he called a midwife. A baby boy was born. One day, the girl sat up in bed and saw the son of her boss rocking the child in a shaft of sunlight. After a year, she agreed to marry him. Two years later, she had another child.</p><p>The man who had become invisible stood in her living room, listening to her story. He had changed so much in five years that now part of him wanted to laugh a hard, cold laugh. She gave him a small photograph of the boy, who was now five. Her hand was shaking. She said, “You didn’t write. I thought you were dead.” He looked at the photograph of the boy who, although the man didn’t know it then, would grow up to look like him, go to college, fall in love, fall out of love, become a famous writer. “What’s his name?” he asked. “I called him Isaac,” she said. They stood for a long time in silence as he stared at the picture. At last he managed three words: “Come with me.” The sound of children shouting rose from the street below. She squeezed her eyes shut. “Come with me,” he said, holding out his hand. Tears rolled down her face. She shook her head. “I can’t,” she said. She looked down at the floor. “Please,” she said. And so he did the hardest thing he’d ever done in his life: he picked up his hat and walked away.</p><p>And if the man who had once promised that he’d never fall in love with another girl as long as he lived kept his promise, it wasn’t because he was stubborn, or even loyal. It was because he couldn’t help it. And, having already hidden for years, hiding his love for a son who didn’t even know he existed didn’t seem unthinkable. Not if it was what the only woman he would ever love needed him to do. After all, what does it mean for a man to hide one more thing when he has vanished completely?</p><p>The morning of the day I was scheduled to model for the art class, I woke in a state of excitement. When I’d waited as long as I could, I took a bus across town. It took me a while to find the right building. I passed it three times before I realized that it had to be the one. It was an old warehouse with some of the windows broken. The front door was rusted and propped open with a cardboard box. For a moment, I let myself imagine that I’d been lured there to be robbed and killed. I pictured my body on the floor in a pool of blood.</p><p>The sky had got dark, and it was starting to rain. I stood there, unable to go forward, unable to turn back. Finally, I heard laughter coming from inside. See, you’re being ridiculous, I thought. I reached for the handle on the door and just then it swung open. A girl wearing a sweater that was too big for her came out. She pushed up her sleeves. Her arms were thin and pale. “Do you need help?” she asked. “I’m looking for a drawing class. There was an ad in the paper. Maybe I have the wrong place—” She gestured. “Upstairs. On the second floor, first room on the right. It doesn’t start for another hour.”</p><p>There was nothing more to say. There were steps and I went up them. My heart was pounding. What kind of fool was I, to think that they wouldn’t turn away when I took off my shirt and dropped my pants and stood naked before them? To think that they would observe my varicose-veined legs, my hairy, sagging <em>knaidlach</em>, and what—start to sketch? And yet. I didn’t turn back. I gripped the bannister and climbed the stairs. I could hear the rain on the skylight. A dirty light filtered through. At the top of the stairs there was a hallway. The room on the<span data-page="page_5"></span> right was empty. There was a block covered with a length of black velvet, and a disorganized circle of folding chairs and easels. I went in and sat down to wait.</p><p>After half an hour, people started to wander in. A woman showed me where to undress, a corner where a makeshift curtain had been hung. I stood there and she pulled it around me. A minute passed, and then I removed my shoes. I lined them up neatly. I took off my socks and put them into the shoes. I unbuttoned my shirt and took that off; there was a hanger, so I hung it. I heard chairs scraping and then laughter. Suddenly I didn’t care about being seen. I would have liked to grab my shoes and slip out of the room, down the stairs, and away from there. And yet. I unzipped my pants. Then it occurred to me: What, exactly, did “nude” mean? Did they really mean no underwear? I deliberated. I reached for the ad in the pocket of my pants. “<em class="small">nude model,”</em> it said. Don’t be an idiot, I told myself. These aren’t amateurs. My underwear was down around my knees when the woman’s footsteps returned. “Are you all right in there?” “Fine, fine. I’ll be out in a moment.” I looked down. There was a tiny smear. My bowels. They never cease to appall me. I stepped out of my underwear and crumpled it into a ball.</p><p>I stood without moving. I was starting to get cold. I thought, So this is how death takes you. Naked in an abandoned warehouse. Tomorrow Bruno would come downstairs and knock on my door and there would be no answer. Forgive me, Bruno. I would have liked to say goodbye. I’m sorry to have disappointed you with so few pages. Then I thought, My book. Who would find it? And then and there I realized that, even though I thought I’d been writing it for myself, the truth was that I wanted someone to read it.</p><p>I pulled back the curtain and stepped forward. Squinting in the light, I stood before them.</p><p>There were maybe twelve students, sitting in chairs holding their drawing pads. The girl in the big sweater was there. The woman who’d shown me where to undress pointed to the box draped in velvet. “Stand here. Strike a pose that feels comfortable.” I didn’t know which way to turn. Someone was going to have to face my rectal side no matter which way you cut it. I let my arms hang at my sides and focussed on a spot on the floor. They lifted their pencils.</p><p>Nothing happened. I felt the plush cloth under the soles of my feet, the hairs rising on my arms, my fingers like ten small weights pulling downward. I felt my body waking under twelve pairs of eyes. I lifted my head.</p><p>“Try to keep still,” the woman said.</p><p>I stared at a crack in the concrete floor. I could hear their pencils moving across the pages. I wanted to smile. Already my body was starting to rebel, the knees beginning to shake and the back muscles straining, but I didn’t care. If need be, I would have stood there all day. Fifteen, twenty minutes passed. Then the woman said, “Why don’t we take a quick break and then we’ll start again with a different pose.”</p><p>I sat. I stood. I rotated. Pages turned. I cycled from feeling to numbness to feeling to numbness. My eyes watered with pain. I recited the aleph-bet twenty-three times. Somehow I got back into my clothes. I couldn’t find my underwear and was too tired to look. I made it down the stairs, clutching the bannister. The woman came down after me. She said, “Wait, you forgot the fifteen dollars.” I took it, and when I went to put it into my pocket I felt the ball of underwear there.</p><p>“Thank you.” I meant that. I was exhausted. But happy.</p><p>I want to say somewhere: I’ve tried to be forgiving. And yet. There were times in my life, whole years, when anger got the better of me. Ugliness turned me inside out. There was a certain satisfaction in bitterness. I courted it. I scowled at the world. And the world scowled back. I slammed the door in people’s faces. I farted where I wanted to fart. I accused cashiers of cheating me out of a penny while holding the penny in my hand. And then one day I realized that I was on my way to being the sort of schmuck who poisons pigeons. People crossed the street to avoid me. I was a human cancer. And to be honest: I wasn’t really angry. Not anymore. I had left my anger somewhere long ago. Put it down on a park bench and walked away. And yet. It had been so long, I didn’t know any other way of being. One day I woke up and said to myself, “It’s not too late.” The first days were strange. I had to practice smiling in front of the mirror. But. It came back to me. It was as if a weight had been lifted. I let go, and something let go of me. A couple of months later, I found Bruno.</p><p>When I got home from the art class, there was a<span data-page="page_6"></span> note from Bruno on my door. It said, “<em class="small">ware are you</em>?” I was too tired to climb the stairs to tell him. I fell into bed still wearing my clothes. It was past midnight when the telephone rang. Bruno, no doubt. I would have ignored it if I hadn’t been afraid he’d call the police. Why couldn’t he just tap on the radiator with his walking stick the way he usually did? (Three taps means “Are you alive?” Two means “Yes,” one “No.”) I threw off the sheets and stumbled across the floor, banging into a table leg. “O.K., O.K.,” I said, picking up the receiver. “No need to wake the whole building.” There was silence on the other end. I said, “Bruno?”</p><p>“Is this Leo Gursky?”</p><p>The man told me that he’d locked himself out of his house. He’d called information for the number of a locksmith. I said I was retired. The man seemed unable to believe his bad luck. He’d already called three other people, and no one had answered. “It’s pouring out here,” he said.</p><p>“Couldn’t you stay somewhere else for the night? In the morning it’ll be easy to find a locksmith. They’re a dime a dozen.”</p><p>“No,” he said. “All right, I mean, if it’s too much . . .” He paused, waiting for me to speak up. I didn’t. “O.K., then.” I could hear the disappointment in his voice. “Sorry to have disturbed you.”</p><p>And yet. He didn’t hang up and neither did I. I was filled with guilt. I thought, What do I need with sleep? There will be time. Tomorrow. Or the next day. Six feet under.</p><p>“O.K., O.K.,” I said, even though I didn’t want to say it. I’d have to dig up my tools. I might as well be looking for a needle in a haystack or a Jew in Poland.</p><p>He gave me an address all the way uptown. Only after I hung up did I remember that I could wait forever before a bus came at that hour. I had a card in the kitchen drawer for Goldstar Car Service, not that I’d ever called it. But. You never know. I ordered a car and started digging through the hall closet for my toolbox. I was still looking when the buzzer rang. When your pants are down around your ankles, that’s when everyone arrives. “I’ll be down in a minute,” I shouted into the speaker, and when I turned around the toolbox was there, right under my nose. I grabbed my raincoat off the floor, smoothed down my hair in the mirror, and went out.</p><p>A black limousine idled in the street, rain falling in the headlights. Other than that, there were only a few empty cars parked along the curb. I was about to go back into the building, but the limousine driver rolled down the window and called my name. He wore a purple turban. I walked up to the window. “There must be a mistake,” I said. “I ordered a car.”</p><p>“O.K.,” he said.</p><p>“But this is a limousine,” I pointed out.</p><p>“O.K.,” he repeated, motioning me in.</p><p>“I can’t pay extra.”</p><p>The turban bobbed. He said, “Get in before you get soaking.”</p><p>I ducked inside. It was bigger than I’d imagined. The soft music coming from up front and the gentle rhythm of the windshield wipers barely reached me. The traffic lights bled into the puddles. There was a little jar of peppermints, and I filled my pockets. When the limousine came to a stop, the driver pointed to a town house. It was beautiful, with steps up to the door and leaves carved in stone. “Seventeen dollars,” the driver said. I felt in my pocket for my wallet. No. Other pocket. My underwear, but no wallet. I must have left it at home in the rush. Then I remembered my fee from the art class. I dug past the peppermints and the underwear, and came up with it. “Sorry,” I said. “How embarrassing. All I have on me is fifteen.” I admit I was reluctant to part with those bills; hard-earned wasn’t the word for them but something else, more bittersweet. But, after a brief pause, the turban bobbed and the money was accepted.</p><p>The man had been waiting under the cornice. Of course, he hadn’t expected me in a limousine, and out I’d popped like Mr. Locksmith to the Stars. I was humiliated. I wanted to explain, “Believe me, I’d never mistake myself for anyone special.” But it was pouring still, and I thought he needed me more than he needed any explanation of how I’d got there. It was a tricky lock. The man stood above me, holding my flashlight. The rain was running down the back of my neck. I felt how much depended on my unlocking that lock. I tried and failed. Tried and failed. And then, at last, my heart started to race. I turned the handle, and the door slipped open.</p><p>He showed me into the living room, where I waited while he went to call me a car and change into dry clothes. I tried to protest, saying I could take the bus or hail a taxi, but he wouldn’t hear of it, what with the rain. The living room was filled with books. I’d never seen so many in one place that wasn’t<span data-page="page_7"></span> a library. I, too, like to read. Once a month, I go to the local branch. For myself, I pick a novel and, for Bruno, with his cataracts, a book on tape. At first Bruno was doubtful. “What am I supposed to do with this?” he said, looking at the box set of “Anna Karenina” as if I’d handed him an enema. And yet. A day or two later I was going about my business when a voice from above bellowed, “All happy families resemble one another,” nearly giving me a conniption. After that, he listened to whatever I’d brought him at top volume and then returned it to me without comment. One afternoon, I came back from the library with “Ulysses.” For a month straight he listened. He had a habit of pressing the stop button and rewinding when he hadn’t fully grasped something. “Ineluctable modality of the visible: at least that.” Pause, rewind. “Ineluctable modality of the.” Pause, rewind. “Ineluctable modality.” Pause. “Ineluct.” When the due date approached, he wanted it renewed. By then I’d had it with his stopping and starting, so I went to the Wiz and got him a Sony Sportsman, and now he schleps it around clipped to his belt. For all I know, he just likes the sound of an Irish accent.</p><p>I thought, Poor Bruno. He’s probably called the morgue to find out if anyone has brought in an old man with an index card in his wallet that says, “<em class="small">my name is leo gursky i have no family please call pinelawn cemetery i have a plot there in the jewish part thank you for your consideration.”</em> Or else he thinks I’m wandering in the rain with my head full of dreams. Once Bruno said that if I bought a pigeon, by the time I was halfway down the street it would become a dove; on the bus home, a parrot; and in my apartment, the moment before I took it out of the cage, a phoenix. “That’s you,” he said, brushing some crumbs that weren’t there from the table. “No, it’s not,” I said. He shrugged and looked out the window. “Who ever heard of a phoenix?” I said. “A peacock, maybe. But a phoenix—I don’t think so.” His face was turned away, but I thought I saw his mouth twitch in a smile.</p><p>Out of habit, I looked on the man’s shelves to see if there was anything by my Isaac. Sure enough, there was. And not just one book but four. I pulled one out and turned it over to look at Isaac’s photograph. We met once. He was giving a reading at the 92nd Street Y. I bought tickets four months in advance. Many times in my life I’d imagined our meeting. I as his father, he as my son. And yet. I knew that it could never happen that way. I’d accepted that the most I could hope for was a place in the audience. But during the reading something came over me. Afterward, I found myself standing in line, my hands shaking as I pressed into his the scrap of paper on which I’d written my name. He glanced at it and copied it into a book. I tried to say something, but there was no sound. He smiled and thanked me. And yet. I didn’t budge. “Is there something else?” he asked. I flapped my hands. The woman behind me gave me an impatient look and pushed forward to greet him. What could he do? Like a fool, I flapped. He signed the woman’s book. It was uncomfortable for everyone. The line had to move around me. Occasionally, he looked up at me, bewildered. Once, he smiled at me the way you smile at an idiot. But. My hands fought to tell him everything. At least as much as they could before a security guard grasped my elbow and escorted me to the door. It was winter. Fat white flakes fell under the street lamps. I waited for him to come out, but he never did. Maybe there was a back door, I don’t know. I took the bus home. That night, before I went to sleep, I opened the book, which I’d placed on my bedside table. “To Leah Gersky,” it said.</p><p>I was still holding the book when the man came up behind me. “You know it?” he asked. I dropped it, and it landed with a thud, my son’s face staring up. I was suddenly tired, more tired than I’d been in years. I tried to explain. “I’m his father,” I said. Or maybe I said, “He’s my son.” Whatever it was, I got the point across, because the man looked shocked, and then he looked surprised, and then he looked like he didn’t believe me. Which was fine with me, because, after all, who did I think I was, showing up in a limousine, picking a lock, and then claiming to be the progenitor of a famous writer?</p><p>I leaned over, picked the book up, and put it back on the shelf. The man kept looking at me, but just then the car honked outside, which was lucky because I’d had enough of being looked at for one day. “Well,” I said, making my way toward the front door, “I’d better be going.” The man reached for his wallet, took<span data-page="page_8"></span> out a hundred-dollar bill, and handed it to me. “His father?” he asked, unbelieving. I pocketed the money and handed him a complimentary peppermint. I stuffed my feet into my wet shoes. “Not really his father,” I said. And because I didn’t know what else to say, I said, “More like his uncle.” This seemed to confuse him even more, but just in case I added, “Not exactly his uncle.” He raised his eyebrows. I picked up my toolbox and stepped out into the rain. When I got to the car, he was still standing in the doorway, looking out. To prove that I was off my rocker, I gave him the Queen’s wave.</p><p>It was three in the morning when I got home. But I couldn’t sleep. I lay on my back, listening to the rain. Then I got out of bed and went to the kitchen. I keep my manuscript in a box in the oven. I took it out, set it on the kitchen table. I put the water on to boil. The rain was tapering off. A pigeon cooed on the windowsill. It puffed up its body, strutted back and forth, and took flight. Free as a bird, so to speak. I rolled a sheet of paper into my typewriter and, with two fingers, I picked out a title: “Words for Everything.”</p><p>Before I could change my mind, I rolled it out, laid it on top of the stack of pages in the box, and closed the lid. I found some brown paper and wrapped it up. On the front I wrote Isaac’s address, which I knew by heart.</p><p>Nothing happened. No wind to sweep everything away. No heart attack. No angel at the door. Outside, the sky lightened. I ate a Metamucil bar and gave myself a sponge bath. I dressed. I spat into my palm and tried to force my hair into submission. I sat with the brown paper package on my lap. At eight-forty-five, I put my raincoat on and tucked the package under my arm. Then I went out the door and into the morning.</p><p>I don’t know what I expected, but I expected something. My fingers shook whenever I went to unlock the mailbox. I went Monday. Nothing. I went Tuesday and Wednesday. There was nothing on Thursday, either. Friday, as I sat dozing in my chair, the telephone rang. I was sure it was my son. But. It was only the teacher from the art class saying that she was looking for people for a project she was doing at a gallery, and she’d thought of me, because of my compelling presence. Naturally, I was flattered. At any other time, it would have been reason enough to splurge on spare ribs. And yet. “What kind of project?” I asked. She said that all I had to do was sit naked on a metal stool in the middle of the room, and then, if I felt like it, which she was hoping I would, dip my body into a vat of kosher cow’s blood and roll on the large white sheets of paper provided.</p><p>I may be a fool but I’m not desperate. I thanked her very much for the offer, but said that I was going to have to turn it down since I was already scheduled to sit on my thumb and rotate in accordance with the movements of the earth around the sun. She was disappointed. But she seemed to understand. She said that if I wanted to see the drawings the class had done of me I could come to the show they were putting up in a month. I wrote down the date and hung up the phone.</p><p>I’d been in the apartment all day, so I decided to go out for a walk. I’m an old man. But I can still get around. It started to get dark, but I persevered. I didn’t have any destination in mind. When I saw a Starbucks, I went in and bought a coffee, because I felt like a coffee, not because I wanted anyone to notice me. Normally I would have made a big production—“Give me a Grande Venti, I mean a Tall Grande, give me a Chai Super Venti Grande, or do I want a Short Frappe?”—and then, for punctuation, I would’ve had a small mishap at the milk station. Not this time. I poured the milk like a regular citizen of the world and sat down in an easy chair across from a man reading the newspaper. I wrapped my hands around the coffee. The warmth felt good. At the next table there was a girl with blue hair leaning over a notebook and chewing on a ballpoint, and at the table next to her was a little boy in a soccer uniform sitting with his mother, who told him, “The plural of ‘elf’ is ‘elves.’ ” A wave of happiness came over me. I felt giddy to be part of it all. To be drinking a cup of coffee like a normal person. I wanted to shout out, “The plural of ‘elf’ is ‘elves’! What a language! What a world!”</p><p>There was a pay phone by the rest room. I felt in my pocket for a quarter and dialled Bruno’s number. It rang nine times. The girl with blue hair passed me on<span data-page="page_9"></span> the way to the rest room. I smiled at her. Amazing! She smiled back. On the tenth ring he picked up.</p><p>“Bruno?”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“Isn’t it good to be alive?”</p><p>“No, thank you, I don’t want to buy anything.”</p><p>“I’m not trying to sell you anything! It’s Leo. Listen. I was sitting here drinking a coffee and suddenly it hit me.”</p><p>“Who hit you?”</p><p>“<em>Ach</em>, listen! It hit me how good it is to be alive. Alive! And I wanted to tell you. Do you understand what I’m saying? I’m saying life is a thing of beauty, Bruno. A thing of beauty and a joy forever.”</p><p>There was a pause.</p><p>“Sure, whatever you say, Leo. Life is a beauty.”</p><p>“And a joy forever,” I said.</p><p>“All right,” Bruno said. “And a joy.”</p><p>I waited.</p><p>“Forever.”</p><p>I was about to hang up when Bruno said, “Leo?”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“Did you mean <em>human</em> life?”</p><p>I worked on my coffee for half an hour, making the most of it. The girl closed her notebook and got up to leave. The man neared the end of his newspaper. I read the headlines. I was a small part of something larger than myself. Yes, human life. Human! Life! Then the man turned the page and my heart stopped.</p><p>It was a picture of Isaac. I collect all his clippings, and I thought I’d seen every picture of him. I’ve studied them all a thousand times. And yet. This one was new to me. He was standing in front of a window, his chin down, head tilted slightly to the side. He might have been thinking. But his eyes were looking up, as if someone had called his name right before the shutter clicked. I wanted to call out to him. It was only a newspaper, but I wanted to holler it at the top of my lungs. “Isaac! Here I am! Can you hear me, my little Isaac?” I wanted him to turn his eyes to me just as he had to whoever had shaken him from his thoughts. But. He couldn’t.</p><p>The headline said: “<em class="small">isaac moritz, novelist, dead at 60.”</em></p><p>Hours passed. Finally a Starbucks employee with a ring in his eyebrow came up to me. “We’re closing,” he said. I looked around. It was true. Everyone was gone. A girl with painted nails was dragging a broom across the floor. I got up. Or. I tried to get up but my legs wanted nothing to do with me. The Starbucks employee looked at me as if I were a cockroach in the brownie mix. The paper cup I held was crushed to a damp pulp in my palm. I handed it to him and started to make my way across the floor. Then I remembered the newspaper. The employee had already thrown it into the trash bin he was rolling across the floor. I fished it out while he looked on.</p><p>I don’t know how I got home. Bruno must have heard me unlock the door, because a minute later he came downstairs and knocked. I didn’t answer. I was sitting in the dark in the chair by the window. He kept knocking. Finally, I heard him go back upstairs. An hour or more went by, and then I heard him on the stairs again. He slid a piece of paper under the door. It said, “<em class="small">life is butiful</em>.” I pushed it back out. He pushed it back in. I pushed it out, he pushed it in. Out, in, out, in. I stared at it. “<em class="small">life is butiful.</em>” I thought, Perhaps it is. Perhaps that is the word for life. I heard Bruno breathing on the other side of the door. I found a pencil. I scrawled, “<em class="small">and a joke forever.”</em> I pushed it back under the door. A pause while he read it. Then, satisfied, he made his way up the stairs.</p><p>It’s possible I cried. What’s the difference.</p><p>Then I picked up the newspaper, cut out the photograph of Isaac, and put it in my wallet, in the plastic part made for a photo. I opened and closed the Velcro a few times to look at his face. Then I noticed that, underneath where I had cut out the picture, the paper said, “A memorial service will be held tomorrow at 10 <em class="small">a.m</em>. at Central Synagogue.”</p><p>I took out the wrinkled schmatte I call a suit. I sat at the kitchen table and made a single rip in the collar. I would have liked to shred the whole thing. But. I restrained myself. Fishl the tzaddik who might have been an idiot once said, <em>A single rip is harder to bear than a hundred rips.</em> I bathed myself. I dressed, and brought the vodka down off the shelf. I took a drink, wiping my mouth with the back of my hand, repeating the gesture that had been made a hundred times by my father and his father and his father’s father, eyes half closed as the sharpness of alcohol replaced the sharpness of grief.</p><p>I woke up on the floor to the sound of pigeons ruffling their feathers on the windowsill. When I looked at the clock, it was already quarter past ten. I like to think that the world wasn’t ready for me, but maybe the truth is that I wasn’t ready for the world. I’ve<span data-page="page_10"></span> always arrived too late for my life. I ran to the bus stop. I use “ran” as a shorthand for hobbled, did a little skip, scampered, stopped and panted, then hobbled again. Like so, I made my way. I caught the bus uptown. I use “caught” here equally metaphorically, because the bus was moving at a snail’s pace and you can’t catch something that lacks all momentum. We sat in traffic. “Doesn’t this thing go any faster?” I said loudly. The woman next to me got up and moved to another seat.</p><p>By the time I got to the shul the service was already over, but the place was still crowded with people. A man in a yellow bow tie and a white suit, what was left of his hair lacquered across his scalp, said, “Of course we knew, but when it finally happened none of us were ready,” to which a woman standing next to him replied, “Who can be ready?” I stood alone by a large potted plant. My palms were damp. I felt myself getting dizzy. Perhaps it had been a mistake to come.</p><p>Out of the corner of my eye I saw Bernard, Isaac’s half brother. A huge oaf, the spitting image of his father, may his memory be a blessing—yes, even his. He’s been in the ground three years. I consider it a small victory that he kicked the bucket before me. And yet. When I remember, I light a yahrzeit candle for him. If not me, who? She died two years earlier. I saw her one more time, at the very end. There was a nurse at the hospital, a young girl, and I told her . . . not the truth but a story not unlike the truth. This nurse let me come in one night after hours, when there was no chance of my running into anyone. She was hooked to life support, tubes up her nose, one foot in the other world. She was tiny and wrinkled and deaf as a doorknob. And yet. I told her jokes. I was a regular Jackie Mason. I tried to keep things light. I said, “Would you believe, this thing here where your arm bends, this they call an elbow.” Many things I did not say. Example. “I waited so long.” Other example. “And were you happy? With that nebbish, that clod, that numbskull, that schlemiel you call a husband?” The truth was I’d given up waiting long before. The moment had passed; the door between the lives we could have led and the lives we came to call our own had shut.</p><p>“Are you all right? You’re looking pale.” It was the man in the yellow bow tie.</p><p>I tried to steady myself against the potted plant. “Fine, fine,” I said.</p><p>“How did you know him?” he asked suspiciously.</p><p>“We were . . . related,” I said.</p><p>“Family! So sorry, forgive me. I thought I’d met all the <em>mishpocheh!</em>” The way he pronounced it was “mishpoky.” “Of course, I should have guessed.” He looked me up and down, running a palm over his hair to make sure that it was securely positioned. “I was his editor,” he said. “I thought you were one of the fans.” He gestured toward the thinning crowd. “Which side, then?”</p><p>A wave of nausea came over me, and I tried to focus on the man’s bow tie while the room around me swayed. “Both,” I said.</p><p>“<em>Both</em>,” he repeated, incredulous.</p><p>A moment later, I was standing face to face with Bernard. “Look what I rustled up,” the man with the bow tie said. “Says he’s <em>mishpoky</em>.”</p><p>Bernard smiled politely as he eyed the rip in my collar. “Forgive me,” he said. “I don’t remember you. Have we met?”</p><p>I glanced at the sign marked “Exit.” I opened my mouth. And yet.</p><p>“Did you know Isaac?” my son’s brother persisted. The man in the bow tie was hanging on every word. I found it difficult to breathe.</p><p>Bernard waited. “Well,” he said finally. “Thank you for coming. It’s been moving to see how many people have come out. Isaac would have been pleased.” He took my hand between his and shook it. He turned to go.</p><p>“S.,” I said. I hadn’t planned on it.</p><p>Bernard turned back. “Pardon?”</p><p>“I come from S.,” I said.</p><p>“You come from S.?” he repeated.</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>Something broke on his face. “She used to tell us about it,” he said.</p><p>“Who’s she?” the man with the bow tie demanded.</p><p>“My mother. He comes from the same village as my mother,” Bernard said. “So many stories. When we were kids. About the river where she swam.”</p><p>I nodded. <em>The water was freezing</em>. <em>We would undress and jump off the footbridge screaming. Our hearts would stop. For a moment, we felt as if we were drowning. When we scrambled back onto the bank, gasping for air, our legs were heavy, pain shooting up the ankles. Your mother was tall and skinny, with small, pale breasts. I would fall asleep drying in the sun, and wake to the shock of ice-cold water on my back. And her laughter.</em></p><p>“Her father’s shoe shop,” Bernard said. “She told us all about it. The bakery she used to pass on the way to school, with the smell of fresh bread.”</p><p><em>Except for the three weeks when we weren’t speaking<span data-page="page_11"></span> to each other, hardly a day passed that we didn’t walk to school together. In the cold her wet hair would freeze into icicles. In the spring I used to pick a daisy and she would put it behind her ear.</em></p><p>“The little pond she skated on in the winter. The wild blackberries behind her father’s shed. The field where she used to play.”</p><p>“Yes,” I said. “The field.”</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, I was sandwiched between Isaac’s editor and a young woman in the back of a stretch limousine. You would think I was making a habit of it. We were going to Bernard’s house for a small gathering of family and friends. Bernard lived somewhere on Long Island, in a house surrounded by trees. I’d never seen such beautiful trees, great canopies of shadow and light.</p><p>Inside the house, people stood around a table piled with bagels, lox, and whitefish and talked about Isaac. I knew I didn’t belong there. I felt like a fool and an impostor. I stood by the window, making myself invisible. I hadn’t thought it would be so painful. To hear people talk about the son I could only imagine as if he were as familiar to them as a garden potato was almost too much to bear. So I slipped away and wandered through the rooms of the house. I thought, My son walked on this carpet. I came to a guest bedroom. I thought, From time to time, he slept in this bed. This very bed! His head on <em>these</em> pillows. I lay down—I was tired, I couldn’t help myself. The pillow sank under my cheek. And as he lay here, I thought, he looked out this very window, at that very tree.</p><p>“You’re such a dreamer,” Bruno says, and maybe I am. Maybe I was also dreaming this. In a moment the doorbell would ring, I’d open my eyes, and Bruno would be standing there asking if I had a roll of toilet paper.</p><p>I must have fallen asleep, because the next thing I knew Bernard was standing above me.</p><p>“Sorry! I didn’t realize anyone was in here. Are you sick?”</p><p>I sprang up. If the word “spring” can be used in reference to my movements at all, this was the moment. And that’s when I saw it. It was on a shelf right behind his shoulder. In a silver picture frame.</p><p>Bernard turned. “Oh, that,” he said, taking it down off the shelf. “This is my mother when she was a girl. Did you know her then?”</p><p><em>Let’s stand under a tree</em>, <em>she said</em>. <em>Why</em>? <em>Because it’s nicer. Maybe you should sit on a chair, and I’ll stand above you, like they always do with husbands and wives. That’s stupid. Why</em>? <em>Because we’re not married. Should we hold hands</em>? <em>We can’t. Why not</em>? <em>Because people will know. Know what</em>? <em>About us. So what if they know</em>? <em>It’s better when it’s a secret. Why</em>? <em>So no one can take it from us.</em></p><p>“I found it in her things after she died,” Bernard said. “It’s a beautiful photograph, isn’t it? She didn’t have much from over there. A couple of photos of her parents and her sisters, that’s all. Of course, she had no idea she would never see them again, so she didn’t bring much. But I never saw this one. Don’t know who he is. Friend of hers, I guess. It was in an envelope with some papers in Yiddish.”</p><p><em>If I had a camera</em>, <em>I said</em>, <em>I’d take a picture of you every day. That way I’d remember how you looked every single day of your life. I look the same. No, you don’t. You’re changing all the time. Every day a tiny bit. If I could, I’d keep a record of it all. If you’re so smart, how did I change today</em>? <em>You got a fraction of a millimeter taller, for one thing. Your hair grew a fraction of a millimeter longer. And your breasts grew a fraction of a— They did not! Yes, they did. What else, you big pig</em>? <em>You got a little happier and also a little sadder. How do you know</em>? <em>Think about it. Have you ever been happier than right now</em>? <em>I guess not. And have you ever been sadder than right now</em>? <em>No. It isn’t like that for everyone. Some people just get happier and happier. And some people, like Beyla Asch, get sadder and sadder. What about you</em>? <em>Are you the happiest and saddest right now that you’ve ever been</em>? <em>Of course I am. Why</em>? <em>Because nothing makes me happier and nothing makes me sadder than you.</em></p><p>We stood together looking at the photograph. Bernard patted my back. “I’d love to stay here reminiscing,” he said, “but I really should go. All those people out there.” He gestured. “Let me know if you need anything.” He closed the door behind him, and then, God help me, I took the photograph and shoved it in my pants. Down the stairs I went, and out the door. In the driveway, I knocked on the window of one of the limousines. The driver roused himself from sleep.</p><p>“I’m ready to go back now,” I said.</p><p>To my surprise, he got out, opened the door, and helped me in.</p><p>When I got home, I thought I’d been robbed. The furniture was overturned, and<span data-page="page_final"></span> the floor was dusted with white powder. I grabbed the baseball bat I keep in the umbrella stand and followed the trail of footsteps to the kitchen. Every surface was covered with pots and pans and dirty bowls. It seemed that whoever had broken in to rob me had taken his time and made himself a meal. On the kitchen table, next to my typewriter, was a large cake, sunk in the middle. Standing, nonetheless. It was frosted with yellow icing, and across the top, in sloppy pink letters, it read “<em class="small">look who baked a cake.”</em> On the other side of my typewriter was a note: “<em class="small">waited all day.”</em></p><p>I couldn’t help it, I smiled. I put the baseball bat away, picked up the pots and pans, took out the picture, breathed on the glass, rubbed it with my shirt, and set it down on my night table. It had been a long time since anyone had given me a gift. A feeling of happiness nudged my heart. That I could wake up each morning and warm my hands on a hot cup of tea. That I could watch the pigeons fly. That at the end of my life Bruno had not forgotten me. ♦</p>	Nicole Krauss	February 9, 2004 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/02/09/the-last-words-on-earth	Death	Friendship	Heart Attacks	Immigrants	Jews	Locksmiths	Leo Gursky	First	Immigrants
Wildwood	<p>It’s <span data-page="page_1"></span>never the changes we want that change everything.</p><p>This is how it all starts: with your mother calling you into the bathroom. You will remember what you were doing at that precise moment for the rest of your life: you were reading “Watership Down” and the bucks and their does were making the dash for the raft and you didn’t want to stop reading, the book had to go back to your brother tomorrow, but then she called you again, louder, her I’m-not-fucking-around voice, and you mumbled irritably, Sí, señora.</p><p>She is standing in front of the medicine-cabinet mirror, naked from the waist up, her bra slung about her hips like a torn sail, the scar on her back as vast and inconsolable as the sea. You want to return to your book, to pretend you didn’t hear her, but it is too late. Her eyes meet yours, the same big smoky eyes you will have in the future. Ven acá, she commands. She is frowning at something on one of her breasts.</p><p>Your mother’s breasts are immensities. One of the wonders of the world. The only ones you’ve seen that are bigger are in nudie magazines or on really fat ladies. They’re forty-two triple Ds and the aureoles are as big as saucers and black as pitch and at their edges are fierce hairs that sometimes she plucks and sometimes she doesn’t. These breasts have always embarrassed you and when you walk in public with her you are conscious of them. After her face and her hair, her tetas are what she is most proud of. Your father could never get enough of them, she always brags. But given the fact that he ran off on her after their third year of marriage it seemed in the end that he could.</p><p>You dread conversations with your mother. These one-sided dressing-downs. You figure that she has called you in to give you another earful about your diet. Your mom’s convinced that if you only eat more plátanos you will suddenly acquire her extraordinary train-wrecking secondary sex characteristics. Even at that age you are nothing if not your mother’s daughter. You are twelve years old and already as tall as her, a long slender-necked ibis of a girl. You have her straight hair, which makes you look more Hindu than Dominican, and a behind that the boys haven’t been able to stop talking about since the fifth grade and whose appeal you do not yet understand. You have her complexion, too, which means you are dark as night. But for all your similarities the tides of inheritance have yet to reach your chest. You have only the slightest hint of breasts: from most angles you’re flat as a board and you’re thinking she’s going to order you to stop wearing bras again because they’re suffocating your potential breasts, discouraging them from popping out. You’re ready to argue with her to the death, because you’re as possessive of your bras as you are of the pads you now buy yourself.</p><p>But no, she doesn’t say a word about eating more plátanos. Instead, she takes your right hand and guides you. Your mom is rough in all things, but this time she is gentle. You did not think her capable of it.</p><p>Do you feel that? she asks in her too familiar raspy voice.</p><p>At first all you feel is the density of the tissue and the heat of her, like a bread that never stopped rising. She kneads your fingers into her. You’re as close as you’ve ever been and your breathing is what you hear.</p><p>Don’t you feel that?</p><p>She turns toward you. Coño, muchacha, stop looking at me and feel.</p><p>So you close your eyes and your fingers are pushing down and you’re thinking of Helen Keller and how when you were little you wanted to be her except more nunnish and then suddenly you do feel something. A knot just beneath her skin, tight and secretive as a plot. And at that moment, for reasons you will never quite understand, you are overcome by the feeling, the premonition, that something in your life is about to change. You become light-headed and you can feel a throbbing in your blood, a rhythm, a drum. Bright lights zoom through you like photon torpedoes, like comets. You don’t know how or why you know this thing, but that you know it cannot be doubted. It is exhilarating. For as long as you’ve been alive you’ve had bruja ways; even your mother will not begrudge you that much. Hija de Liborio, she called you after you picked your tía’s winning numbers for her and when you guessed correctly how old to the day she’d been when she left home for the U.S. (a fact she’d never told anyone). You assumed Liborio was a relative. That was before Santo Domingo, before you knew about the Great Power of God.</p><p>I feel it, you say, too loudly. Lo siento.</p><p>And like that, everything changes. Before the winter is out the doctors remove that breast you were kneading and its partner, along with the auxiliary lymph nodes. Because of the operations, your mother will have trouble lifting her arms over her head for the rest of her life. Her hair begins to fall out and one day she pulls it all out herself and<span data-page="page_2"></span> puts it in a plastic bag. You change, too. Not right away, but it happens. And it’s in that bathroom that it all begins. That you begin.</p><p>A punk chick. That’s what I became. A Siouxsie and the Banshees-loving punk chick. The Puerto Rican kids on the block couldn’t stop laughing when they saw my hair; they called me Blacula. And the morenos, they didn’t know what to say; they just called me devil-bitch. Yo, devil-bitch, yo, <em>yo!</em> My tía Rubelka thought it was some kind of mental illness. Hija, she said while frying pastelitos, maybe you need <em>help</em>. But my mother was the worst. It’s the last straw, she screamed. The. Last. Straw. But it always was with her. Mornings when I came downstairs she’d be in the kitchen making her coffee in la greca and listening to Radio WADO and when she saw me and my hair she’d get mad all over again, as if during the night she’d forgotten who I was.</p><p>My mother was one of the tallest women in Paterson and her anger was just as tall. It pincered you in its long arms, and if you showed any weakness you were finished. Que muchacha tan fea, she said in disgust, splashing the rest of her coffee in the sink. Fea had become my name. It was nothing new, to tell the truth. She’d been saying stuff like that all our lives. My mother would never win any awards, believe me. You could call her an absentee parent: if she wasn’t at work she was sleeping and when she wasn’t sleeping all she did was scream and hit. As kids, me and Oscar were more scared of our mother than we were of the dark or el cuco. She would hit us anywhere, in front of anyone, always free with the chanclas and the correa, but now with her cancer there wasn’t much she could do anymore. The last time she tried to whale on me it was because of my hair, but instead of cringing or running I punched her hand. It was a reflex more than anything, but once it happened I knew I couldn’t take it back, not ever, and so I just kept my fist clenched, waiting for whatever came next, for her to attack me with her teeth like she had this one lady in the Pathmark. But she just stood there shaking, in her stupid wig and her stupid bata, with two huge foam prostheses in her bra, the smell of burning wig all around us. I almost felt sorry for her. This is how you treat your mother? she cried. And if I could I would have broken the entire length of my life across her face, but instead I screamed back, And this is how you treat your daughter?</p><p>Things had been bad between us all year. How could they not have been? She was my Old World Dominican mother who had come alone to the United States and I was her only daughter, the one she had raised up herself with the help of nobody, which meant it was her duty to keep me crushed under her heel. I was fourteen and desperate for my own patch of world that had nothing to do with her. I wanted the life that I used to see when I watched “Big Blue Marble” as a kid, the life that drove me to make pen pals and to borrow atlases from school. The life that existed beyond Paterson, beyond my family, beyond Spanish. And as soon as she became sick I saw my chance and I’m not going to pretend or apologize; I saw my chance and eventually I took it.</p><p>If you didn’t grow up like I did then you don’t know and if you don’t know it’s probably better you don’t judge. You don’t know the hold our mothers have on us, even the ones that are never around—<em>especially</em> the ones that are never around. What it’s like to be the perfect Dominican daughter, which is just a nice way of saying a perfect Dominican slave. You don’t know what it’s like to grow up with a mother who never said anything that wasn’t negative, who was always suspicious, always tearing you down and splitting your dreams straight down the seams. On TV and in books mothers talk to daughters, about life, about themselves, but on Main Street in Paterson mothers say not a word unless it’s to hurt you. When my first pen pal, Tomoko, stopped writing me after three letters my mother was the one who said, You think someone’s going to lose life writing to you? Of course I cried; I was eight and I had already planned that Tomoko and her family would adopt me. My mother, of course, saw clean into the marrow of those dreams and laughed. I wouldn’t write to you, either, she said.</p><p>She was that kind of mother: who makes you doubt yourself, who would wipe you out if you let her. But I’m not going to pretend, either. For a long time I let her say what she wanted about me and, what was worse, for a long time I believed her. I was a fea, I was a worthless, I was an idiota. From ages two to thirteen I believed her and because I believed<span data-page="page_3"></span> her I was the perfect hija. I was the one cooking, cleaning, doing the wash, buying groceries, writing letters to the bank to explain why a house payment was going to be late, translating. I had the best grades in my class. I never caused trouble, even when the morenas used to come after me with scissors because of my straight straight hair. I stayed at home and made sure my little brother Oscar was fed and everything ran right while she was at work. I raised him and I raised me. I was the one. You’re my hija, she said, that’s what you’re supposed to be doing. When that thing happened to me when I was eight and I finally told her what our neighbor had done she told me to shut my mouth and stop crying and I did exactly that, I shut my mouth and clenched my legs and my mind and within a year I couldn’t have told you what he looked like or even his name. All you do is complain, she said to me, but you have no idea what life really is. Sí, señora.</p><p>When she told me that I could go on my sixth-grade sleepaway to Bear Mountain and I bought a backpack with my own paper-route money and wrote Bobby Santos notes because he was promising to break into my cabin and kiss me in front of everyone I believed her and when on the morning of the trip she announced that I wasn’t going and I said, But you promised, and she said, Muchacha del diablo, I promised you nothing, I didn’t throw my backpack at her or pull out my hair, and when it was Laura Saenz who ended up kissing Bobby Santos, not me, I didn’t say anything, either. I just lay in my room with stupid Bear-Bear and sang under my breath, imagining where I would run away to when I grew up. To Japan maybe, where I would track down Tomoko, or to Austria, where my singing would inspire a remake of “The Sound of Music.”</p><p>All my favorite books from that period were about runaways—“Watership Down,” “The Incredible Journey,” “My Side of the Mountain”—and when Bon Jovi’s “Runaway” came out I imagined it was me they were singing about. No one had any idea. I was the tallest, dorkiest girl in school, the one who dressed up as Wonder Woman every Halloween, the one who never said a word. People saw me in my glasses and my hand-me-down clothes and could not have imagined what I was capable of. And then when I was twelve I got that feeling, the scary witchy one, and before I knew it my mother was sick and the wildness that had been in me all along, that I had tried to tamp down with chores and with homework and with promises that once I reached college I would be able to do whatever I pleased, burst out. I couldn’t help it. I tried to keep it down, but it just flooded through all my quiet spaces. It was a message more than a feeling, a message that tolled like a bell: Change, change, change.</p><p>It didn’t happen overnight. Yes the wildness was in me, yes it kept my heart beating fast all the long day, yes it danced around me while I walked down the street, yes it let me look boys straight in the face when they stared at me, yes it turned my laugh from a cough into a wild fever, but I was still scared. How could I not be? I was my mother’s daughter. Her hold on me was stronger than love. And then one day I was walking home with Karen Cepeda, who at that time was my friend. Karen did the goth thing really well; she had spiky Robert Smith hair and wore all black and had the skin color of a ghost. Walking with her in Paterson was like walking with the bearded lady. Everybody would stare and it was the scariest thing and that was, I guess, why I did it.</p><p>We were walking down Main and being glared at by everybody and out of nowhere I said, Karen, I want you to cut my hair. As soon as I said it I knew. The feeling in my blood, the rattle, came over me again. Karen raised her eyebrow: What about your mother? You see, it wasn’t just me—everybody was scared of Belicia de León.</p><p>Fuck her, I said.</p><p>Karen looked at me like I was being stupid—I never cursed, but that was something else that was about to change. The next day we locked ourselves in her bathroom while downstairs her father and uncles were bellowing at some soccer game. Well, how do you want it? she asked. I looked at the girl in the mirror for a long time. All I knew was that I didn’t want to see her ever again. I put the clippers in Karen’s hand, turned them on, and guided her hand until it was all gone.</p><p>So now you’re punk? Karen asked uncertainly.</p><p>Yes, I said.</p><p>The next day my mother threw the wig at me. You’re going to wear this. You’re going to wear it every day. And if I see you without it on I’m going to kill you!</p><p>I didn’t say<span data-page="page_4"></span> a word. I held the wig over the burner.</p><p>Don’t do it, she said as the burner clicked. Don’t you dare—</p><p>It went up in a flash, like gasoline, like a stupid hope, and if I hadn’t thrown it in the sink it would have taken my hand. The smell was horrible, like all the chemicals from all the factories in Elizabeth.</p><p>That was when she slapped at me, when I struck her hand and she snatched it back, like I was the fire.</p><p>Of course everyone thought I was the worst daughter ever. My tía and our neighbors kept saying, Hija, she’s your mother, she’s dying, but I wouldn’t listen. When I hit her hand, a door opened. And I wasn’t about to turn my back on it.</p><p>But God how we fought! Sick or not, dying or not, my mother wasn’t going to go down easy. She wasn’t una pendeja. I’d seen her slap grown men, push white police officers onto their asses, curse a whole group of bochin-cheras. She had raised me and my brother by herself, she had worked three jobs until she could buy this house we lived in, she had survived being abandoned by my father, she had come from Santo Domingo all by herself, and as a young girl she’d been beaten, set on fire, left for dead. (This last part she didn’t tell me, my tía Rubelka did, in a whisper, Your mother almost died, she almost died, and when I asked my mother about it at dinner she took my dinner and gave it to my brother.) That was my mother and there was no way she was going to let me go without killing me first. Figurín de mierda, she called me. You think you’re someone, but you ain’t nada.</p><p>She dug hard, looking for my seams, wanting me to tear like always, but I didn’t, I wasn’t going to. It was that feeling I had that my life was waiting for me on the other side that made me fearless. When she threw away my Smiths and Sisters of Mercy posters—aquí yo no quiero maricones—I bought replacements. When she threatened to rip up my new clothes I started keeping them in my locker and at Karen’s house. When she told me that I had to quit my job at the Greek diner I explained to my boss that my mother was starting to lose it because of her chemo, and when she called to say I couldn’t work there anymore he just handed me the phone and stared out at his customers in embarrassment. When she changed the locks on me—I had started staying out late, going to the Limelight because even though I was fourteen I looked twenty-five—I would knock on Oscar’s window and he would let me in, scared because the next day my mother would run around the house screaming, Who the hell let that hija de la gran puta in the house? Who? Who? And Oscar would be at the breakfast table stammering, I don’t know, Mami, I don’t.</p><p>Her rage filled the house, like flat stale smoke. It got into everything, into our hair and our food, like the fallout they told us about in school that would one day drift down soft as snow. My brother didn’t know what to do. He stayed in his room, though sometimes he would lamely try to ask me what was going on. Nothing. You can tell me, Lola, he said, and I could only laugh. You need to lose weight, I told him.</p><p>In those final weeks I knew better than to go near my mother. Most of the time she just looked at me with the stink eye, but sometimes without warning she would grab me by my throat and hang on until I pried her fingers off. She didn’t bother talking to me unless it was to make death threats: When you grow up you’ll meet me in a dark alley when you least expect it and then I’ll kill you and nobody will know I did it! Gloating as she said this.</p><p>You’re crazy, I told her.</p><p>You don’t call me crazy, she said, and then she sat down panting.</p><p>It was bad, but no one expected what came next. So obvious when you think about it.</p><p>All my life I’d been swearing that one day I would just disappear.</p><p>And one day I did.</p><p>I ran off, dique, because of a boy.</p><p>What can I really tell you about him? He was like all boys: beautiful and callow and, like an insect, he couldn’t sit still. Un blanquito with long hairy legs who I met one night at the Limelight.</p><p>His name was Aldo.</p><p>He was nineteen and lived down at the Jersey Shore with his seventy-four-year-old father. In the back of his Oldsmobile on University I pulled my leather skirt up and my fishnet stockings down and the smell of me was everywhere. I didn’t let him go all the way, but still. The spring of my sophomore year we wrote and called each other at least once a day. I even drove down with Karen to visit him in Wildwood (she had a license, I didn’t). He lived and worked near the boardwalk, one of three guys who operated the bumper cars, the only one without tattoos. You<span data-page="page_5"></span> should stay, he told me that night while Karen walked ahead of us on the beach. Where would I live? I asked, and he smiled. With me. Don’t lie, I said, but he looked out at the surf. I want you to come, he said seriously.</p><p>He asked me three times. I counted, I know.</p><p>That summer my brother announced that he was going to dedicate his life to designing role-playing games, and my mother was trying to keep a second job for the first time since her operation. It wasn’t working out. She was coming home exhausted, and since I wasn’t helping, nothing around the house was getting done. Some weekends my tía Rubelka would help out with the cooking and cleaning and would lecture us both, but she had her own family to look after, so most of the time we were on our own. Come, he said on the phone. And then in August Karen left for Slippery Rock. She had graduated from high school a year early. If I don’t see Paterson again it will be too soon, she said before she left. Five days later, school started. I cut class six times in the first two weeks. I just couldn’t do school anymore. Something inside wouldn’t let me. It didn’t help that I was reading “The Fountainhead” and had decided that I was Dominique and Aldo was Roark. And finally what we’d all been waiting for happened. My mother announced at dinner, quietly, I want you both to listen to me: the doctor is running more tests on me.</p><p>Oscar looked like he was going to cry. He put his head down. And my reaction? I looked at her and said, Could you please pass the salt?</p><p>These days I don’t blame her for smacking me across my face, but right then it was all I needed. We jumped on each other and the table fell and the sancocho spilled all over the floor and Oscar just stood in the corner bellowing, Stop it, stop it, stop it!</p><p>Hija de tu maldita madre! she shrieked. And I said, This time I hope you die from it.</p><p>For a couple of days the house was a war zone, and then on Friday she let me out of my room and I was allowed to sit next to her on the sofa and watch novelas with her. She was waiting for her blood work to come back, but you would never have known her life was in the balance. She watched the TV like it was the only thing that mattered, and whenever one of the characters did something underhanded she would start waving her arms: Someone has to stop her! Can’t they see what that puta is up to?</p><p>I hate you, I said very quietly, but she didn’t hear.</p><p>Go get me some water, she said. Put an ice cube in it.</p><p>That was the last thing I did for her. The next morning I was on the bus bound for the shore. One bag, two hundred dollars in tips, Tío Rudolfo’s old knife, and the only picture my mother had of my father, which she had hidden under her bed (she was in the picture, too, but I pretended not to notice). I was so scared. I couldn’t stop shaking. The whole ride down I was expecting the sky to split open and my mother to reach down and shake me. But it didn’t happen. Nobody but the man across the aisle noticed me. You’re really beautiful, he said. Like a girl I once knew.</p><p>I didn’t write them a note. That’s how much I hated them. Her.</p><p>That night while Aldo and I lay in his sweltering kitty-litter-infested room I told him: I want you to do it to me.</p><p>He started unbuttoning my pants. Are you sure?</p><p>Definitely, I said grimly.</p><p>He had a long thin dick that hurt like hell, but the whole time I just said, Oh yes, Aldo, yes, because that was what I imagined you were supposed to say while you were losing your virginity to some boy you thought you loved.</p><p>It was like the stupidest thing I ever did. I was miserable. And so bored. But of course I wouldn’t admit it. I had run away, so I was happy! Happy!</p><p>Aldo had neglected to mention, all those times he asked me to live with him, that his father hated him like I hated my mother. Aldo, Sr., had been in the Second World War and he’d never forgiven the “Japs” for all the friends he had lost. My dad’s so full of shit, Aldo said. He never left Fort Dix. I don’t think his father said nine words to me the whole time I lived with them. He was one mean viejito and even had a padlock on the refrigerator. Stay the hell out of it, he told me. We couldn’t even get ice cubes out.</p><p>Aldo and his dad lived in one of the cheapest little bungalows on New Jersey Avenue, and me and Aldo slept in a room where his father kept the litter box for his two cats, and at night we would move it out into the hallway, but he always woke up before us and put it back in the room: I told you to leave my crap alone!<span data-page="page_6"></span> Which is funny when you think about it. But it wasn’t funny then. I got a job selling French fries on the boardwalk and between the hot oil and the cat piss I couldn’t smell anything else. On my days off I would drink with Aldo or I would sit in the sand dressed in all black and try to write in my journal, which I was sure would form the foundation for a utopian society after we blew ourselves into radioactive kibble. Sometimes boys would walk up to me and throw lines at me like, Who fuckin’ died? They would sit down next to me in the sand. You a good-looking girl, you should be in a bikini. Why, so you can rape me? Jesus Christ, one of them said, jumping to his feet. What the hell is wrong with you?</p><p>To this day I don’t know how I lasted. At the beginning of October I was laid off from the French-fry palace; by then most of the boardwalk was closed up and I had nothing to do except hang out at the public library, which was even smaller than my high-school one. Aldo had moved on to working with his dad at his garage, which only made them more pissed off at each other and by extension more pissed off at me. When they got home they would drink Schlitz and complain about the Phillies. I guess I should count myself lucky that they didn’t decide to bury the hatchet by gangbanging me. I stayed out as much as I could and waited for the feeling to come back to me, to tell me what I should do next, but I was bone dry, bereft, no visions whatsoever. I started to think that maybe it was like in the books: as soon as I lost my virginity I lost my power. I got really mad at Aldo after that. You’re a drunk, I told him. And an idiot. So what, he shot back. Your pussy smells. Then stay out of it! I will!</p><p>But of course I was happy! Happy! I kept waiting to run into my family posting flyers of me on the boardwalk—my mom, the tallest blackest chestiest thing in sight, Oscar looking like the Brown Blob, my tía Rubelka, maybe even my tío if they could get him off the heroin long enough—but the closest I came to any of that was some flyers someone had put up for a lost cat. That’s white people for you. They lose a cat and it’s an all-points bulletin, but we Dominicans lose a daughter and we might not even cancel our appointment at the salon.</p><p>By November I was so finished. I would sit there with Aldo and his putrid father and the old shows would come on the TV, the ones me and my brother used to watch when we were kids, “Three’s Company,” “What’s Happening!!,” “The Jeffersons,” and my disappointment would grind against some organ that was very soft and tender. It was starting to get cold, too, and wind just walked right into the bungalow and got under your blankets or jumped in the shower with you. It was awful. I kept having these stupid visions of my brother trying to cook for himself. Don’t ask me why. I was the one who cooked for us. The only thing Oscar knew how to make was grilled cheese. I imagined him thin as a reed, wandering around the kitchen, opening cabinets forlornly. I even started dreaming about my mother, except in my dreams she was young, my age, and it was because of those dreams that I realized something obvious: she had run away, too, and that was why we were all in the United States.</p><p>I put away the photo of her and my father, but the dreams didn’t stop. I guess when a person is with you they’re only with you when they’re with you, but when they’re gone, when they’re really gone, they’re with you forever.</p><p>And then at the end of November Aldo, my wonderful boyfriend, decided to be cute. I knew he was getting unhappy with us, but I didn’t know exactly how bad it was until one night he had his friends over. His father had gone to Atlantic City and they were all drinking and smoking and telling dumb jokes and suddenly Aldo says, Do you know what Pontiac stands for? Poor Old Nigger Thinks It’s A Cadillac. Who was he looking at when he told his punch line? He was looking straight at me.</p><p>That night he wanted me but I pushed his hand away. Don’t touch me.</p><p>Don’t get sore, he said, putting my hand on his cock. It wasn’t nothing.</p><p>And then he laughed.</p><p>So what did I do a couple days later—a really dumb thing. I called home. The first time no one answered. The second time it was Oscar. The de León residence, how may I direct your call? That was my brother for you. This is why everybody in the world hated his guts.</p><p>It’s me, dumb-ass.</p><p>Lola. He was so quiet and then I realized he was crying. Where <em>are</em> you?</p><p>You don’t want to know. I switched ears, trying to keep my voice casual. How is everybody?</p><p>Lola, Mami’s going to <em>kill</em> you.</p><p>Dumb-ass, could you keep your voice down.<span data-page="page_7"></span> Mami isn’t home, is she?</p><p>She’s working.</p><p>What a surprise, I said. Mami working. On the last minute of the last hour of the last day my mother would be at work. She would be at work when the missiles were in the air.</p><p>I guess I must have missed him real bad or I just wanted to see somebody who knew anything about me, or the cat piss had damaged my common sense, because I gave him the address of a coffee shop on the boardwalk and told him to bring my clothes and some of my books.</p><p>Bring me money, too.</p><p>He paused. I don’t know where Mami keeps it.</p><p>You know, Mister. Just bring it.</p><p>How much? he asked timidly.</p><p>All of it.</p><p>That’s a lot of money, Lola.</p><p>Just bring me the money, Oscar.</p><p>O.K., O.K. He inhaled deeply. Will you at least tell me if you’re O.K. or not?</p><p>I’m O.K., I said, and that was the only point in the conversation where I almost cried. I kept quiet until I could speak again and then I asked him how he was going to get down here without our mother finding out.</p><p>You know me, he said weakly. I might be a dork, but I’m a resourceful dork.</p><p>I should have known not to trust anybody whose favorite books as a child were Encyclopedia Brown. But I wasn’t really thinking; I was so looking forward to seeing him.</p><p>By then I had this plan. I was going to convince my brother to run away with me. My plan was that we would go to Dublin. I had met a bunch of Irish guys on the boardwalk and they had sold me on their country. I would become a backup singer for U2 and both Bono and the drummer would fall in love with me, and Oscar could become the Dominican James Joyce. I really believed it would happen, too. That’s how deluded I was by then.</p><p>The next day I walked into the coffee shop, looking brand-new, and he was there, with the bag. Oscar, I said, laughing. You’re so fat!</p><p>I know, he said, ashamed. I was worried about you.</p><p>We embraced for like an hour and then he started crying. Lola, I’m sorry.</p><p>It’s O.K., I said, and that’s when I looked up and saw my mother and my tía Rubelka and my tío Rudolfo boiling out of the kitchen.</p><p>Oscar! I screamed, but it was too late. My mother already had me in her hands. She looked so thin and worn, almost like a hag, but she was holding on to me like I was her last nickel, and underneath her red wig her green eyes were <em>furious</em>. I noticed, absently, that she had dressed up for the occasion. That was typical. Muchacha del diablo, she shrieked. I managed to haul her out of the coffee shop and when she pulled back her hand to smack me I broke free. I ran for it. Behind me I could feel her sprawling, hitting the curb hard with a crack, but I wasn’t looking back. No—I was running. In elementary school, whenever we had field day I was always the fastest girl in my grade, took home all the ribbons; they said it wasn’t fair, because I was so big, but I didn’t care. I could even have beaten the boys if I’d wanted to, so there was no way my sick mother, my messed-up tíos, and my fat brother were going to catch me. I was going to run as fast as my long legs could carry me. I was going to run down the boardwalk, past Aldo’s miserable house, out of Wildwood, out of New Jersey, and I wasn’t going to stop. I was going to <em>fly</em>.</p><p>Anyway, that’s how it <em>should</em> have worked out. But I looked back. I couldn’t help it. It’s not like I didn’t know my Bible, all the pillars-of-salt stuff, but when you’re someone’s daughter that she raised by herself with no help from nobody habits die hard. I just wanted to make sure my mom hadn’t broken her arm or smashed open her skull. I mean, really, who the hell wants to kill her own mother by accident? That’s the only reason I glanced back. She was sprawled on the ground, her wig had fallen out of reach, her poor bald head out in the day like something private and shameful, and she was bawling like a lost calf, Hija, hija! And there I was wanting to run off into my future. It was right then that I needed that feeling to guide me, but it wasn’t anywhere in sight. Only me. In the end I didn’t have the ovaries. She was on the ground, bald as a baby, crying, probably a month away from dying, and here I was, her one and only daughter. And there was nothing I could do about it. So I walked back and when I reached down to help her she clamped on to me with both hands. That was when I realized she hadn’t been crying at all. She’d been faking! Her smile was like a lion’s.</p><p>Ya te tengo, she said, jumping triumphantly to her feet. Te tengo.</p><p>And that is how I ended up in Santo Domingo. I guess my mother thought it would be<span data-page="page_8"></span> harder for me to run away from an island where I knew no one, and in a way she was right. I’m into my sixth month here and these days I’m just trying to be philosophical about the whole thing. I wasn’t like that at first, but in the end I had to let it go. It was like the fight between the egg and the rock, my abuela said. No winning.</p><p>I’m actually going to school, not that it’s going to count when I return to Pat-erson, but it keeps me busy and out of trouble and around people my own age. You don’t need to be around us viejos all day, Abuela says. I have mixed feelings about the school. For one thing, it’s improved my Spanish a lot. It’s a private school, a Carol Morgan wanna-be filled with people my tío Carlos Moya calls los hijos de mami y papi. And then there’s me. If you think it was tough being a goth in Paterson, try being a Dominican york in one of those private schools back in D.R. You will never meet bitchier girls in your whole life. They whisper about me to death. Someone else would have had a nervous breakdown, but after Wildwood I’m not so brittle. I don’t let it get to me.</p><p>And the irony of all ironies? I’m on our school’s track team. I joined because my friend Rosio, the scholarship girl from Los Mina, told me I could win a spot on the team on the length of my legs alone. Those are the pins of a winner, she prophesied. Well, she must have known something I didn’t, because I’m now our school’s top runner in the four hundred metres and under. That I have talent at this simple thing never ceases to amaze me. Karen would pass out if she could see me running sprints out behind my school while Coach Cortés screams at us, first in Spanish and then in Catalán. Breathe, breathe, <em>breathe!</em> I’ve got like no fat left on me and the musculature of my legs impresses everyone, even me. I can’t wear shorts anymore without causing traffic jams, and the other day when my abuela accidentally locked us out of the house she turned to me in frustration and said, Hija, just kick the door open. That pushed a laugh out of both of us.</p><p>So much has changed these last months, in my head, my heart. Rosio has me dressing up like a real Dominican girl. She’s the one who fixes my hair and helps me with my makeup, and sometimes when I see myself in mirrors I don’t even know who I am anymore. Not that I’m unhappy or anything. Even if I found a hot-air balloon that would whisk me straight to U2’s house I’m not sure I would take it. (I’m still not talking to my traitor brother, though.) The truth is I’m even thinking of staying one more year. Abuela doesn’t want me ever to leave—I’ll miss you, she says so simply it can’t be anything but true—and my mom has told me I can stay if I want to but that I would be welcome at home, too. Tía Rubelka tells me she’s hanging tough, my mother, that she’s back to two jobs. They sent me a picture of the whole family and Abuela framed it and I can’t look at it without misting up. My mother’s not wearing her fakies in it; she looks so thin I don’t even recognize her.</p><p>Just know that I would die for you, she told me the last time we talked. And before I could say anything she hung up.</p><p>But that’s not what I wanted to tell you. It’s about that crazy feeling that started this whole mess, the bruja feeling that comes singing out of my bones, that takes hold of me the way blood seizes cotton. The feeling that tells me that everything in my life is about to change. It’s come back. Just the other day I woke up from all these dreams and it was there, pulsing inside of me. I imagine this is what it feels like to have a child in you. At first I was scared, because I thought it was telling me to run away again, but every time I looked around our house, every time I saw my abuela the feeling got stronger, so I knew this was something different.</p><p>I was dating a boy by then, a sweet morenito by the name of Max Sánchez, who I had met in Los Mina while visiting Rosio. He’s short, but his smile and his snappy dressing make up for a lot. Because I’m from Nueba Yol he talks about how rich he’s going to become and I try to explain to him that I don’t care about that, but he looks at me like I’m crazy. I’m going to get a white Mercedes-Benz, he says. Tú verás. But it’s the job he has that I love best, that got me and him started. In Santo Domingo two or three theatres often share the same set of reels for a movie, so when the first theatre finishes with the first reel they put it in Max’s hands and he rides his motorcycle like crazy to make it to the second theatre and then he<span data-page="page_final"></span> drives back, waits, picks up the second reel, and so on. If he’s held up or gets into an accident the first reel will end and there will be no second reel and the people in the audience will throw bottles. So far he’s been blessed, he tells me while kissing his San Miguel medal. Because of me, he brags, one movie becomes three. I’m the man who puts together the pictures. Max is not from la clase alta, as my abuela would describe it, and if any of the stuck-up bitches in school saw us they would just about die, but I’m fond of him. He holds open doors, he calls me his morena; when he’s feeling brave he touches my arm gently and then pulls back.</p><p>Anyway I thought maybe the feeling was about Max, and so one day I let him take me to one of the love motels. He was so excited he almost fell off the bed, and the first thing he wanted was to look at my ass. I never knew my big ass could be such a star attraction, but he kissed it, four, five times, gave me goose bumps with his breath, and pronounced it a tesoro. When we were done and he was in the bathroom washing himself I stood in front of the mirror naked and looked at my culo for the first time. A tesoro, I repeated. A treasure.</p><p>Well? Rosio asked at school. And I nodded once, quickly, and she grabbed me and laughed and all the girls I hated turned to look, but what could they do? Happiness, when it comes, is stronger than all the jerk girls in Santo Domingo combined.</p><p>But I was still confused. Because the feeling, it just kept getting stronger and stronger, wouldn’t let me sleep, wouldn’t give me any peace. I started losing races, which was something I never did.</p><p>You ain’t so great, are you, gringa, the girls on the other teams hissed at me, and I could only hang my head. Coach Cortés was so unhappy he just locked himself in his car and wouldn’t say anything to any of us.</p><p>The whole thing was driving me crazy, and then one night I came home from being out with Max. He had taken me for a walk along the Malecón—he never had money for anything else—and we had watched the bats zigzagging over the palms and an old ship head into the distance. While I stretched my hamstrings, he talked quietly about moving to the U.S. My abuela was waiting for me at the living-room table. Even though she still wears black to mourn the husband she lost when she was young she’s one of the most handsome women I’ve ever known. We have the same jagged lightning-bolt part, and when I saw her at the airport, the first time in ten years, I didn’t want to admit it but I knew that things were going to be O.K. between us. She stood like she was her own best thing and when she saw me she said, Hija, I have waited for you since the day you left. And then she hugged me and kissed me and said, I’m your abuela, but you can call me La Inca.</p><p>Standing over her that night, her part like a crack in her hair, I felt a surge of tenderness. I put my arms around her and that was when I noticed that she was looking at photos. Old photos, the kind I’d never seen in my house. Photos of my mother when she was young, before she had her breasts. She was even skinnier than me! I picked the smallest photo up. Mami was standing in front of a bakery. Even with an apron on she looked potent, like someone who was going to be someone.</p><p>She was very guapa, I said casually.</p><p>Abuela snorted. Guapa soy yo. Your mother was a diosa. But so cabeza dura. When she was your age we never got along. She was cabeza dura and I was . . . exigente. You and her are more alike than you think.</p><p>I know she ran away. From you. From Santo Domingo.</p><p>La Inca stared at me, incredulous. Your mother didn’t run away. We had to <em>send</em> her away. To keep her from being murdered. To keep us all from being murdered. She didn’t listen and she fell in love with the wrong man. She didn’t listen. Jesu Cristo, hija—</p><p>She was about to say something more and then she stopped.</p><p>And that’s when it hit with the force of a hurricane. The <em>feeling</em>. My abuela was sitting there, forlorn, trying to cobble together the right words, and I could not move or breathe. I felt like I always did in the last seconds of a race, when I was sure that I was going to explode. She was about to say something and I was waiting for whatever she was going to give me. I was waiting to begin. ♦</p>	Junot Díaz	June 11, 2007 Issue	https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/06/11/wildwood	Breast Cancer	Breasts	Brothers	Daughters	Dominican Republic	Grandmothers	Unnamed	First	Immigrants
